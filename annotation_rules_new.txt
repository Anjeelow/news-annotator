SECTION 1 — TYPES AND CLASSIFICATION OF BIAS

CORE DEFINITIONS

Bias refers to language that influences how readers perceive the Philippine Government’s actions or performance.

Bias may be:
- Subtle: Slightly nudges perception through wording or framing.
- Overt (Blatant): Strongly directs reader approval or disapproval.

Both subtle bias and overt bias count as biased language.


1. OPINION STATEMENTS

Bias exists when subjective judgment is presented without factual grounding.

Indicators:
- Personal commentary
- Value judgments framed as fact
- Claims about intent or effectiveness without evidence

Examples:
- Biased For: “The policy is crucial for national security.”
- Biased Against: “The policy exists only to suppress dissent.”
- Neutral: “The policy was enacted last year.”


2. SENSATIONALISM

Bias created through exaggeration or emotionally charged framing.

Indicators:
- Overstated outcomes
- Extreme praise or condemnation

Examples:
- Biased For: “The policy was a massive success.”
- Biased Against: “The policy has spelled disaster for millions.”
- Neutral: “The policy produced mixed results.”


3. AD HOMINEM BIAS

Bias that focuses on character rather than actions or evidence.

Indicators:
- Red-tagging
- Moral labeling
- Praising character to legitimize actions

Examples:
- Biased For: Attacking critics as “radicals” or “terrorists”
- Biased Against: Calling officials “thieves” or “oppressors”
- Neutral: Reporting disagreement without character judgment


4. MIND READING BIAS

Bias that assumes intent, motive, or internal reasoning without attribution.

Rule:
Even if an official explanation exists, failure to credit a source still counts as mind reading.

Examples:
- Biased For: “The government acted out of pure concern for citizens.”
- Biased Against: “The policy was designed to silence critics.”
- Neutral: “The government stated the policy aims to…”


5. SLANT, LABELING, SUBJECTIVE ADJECTIVES, AND WORD CHOICE

This category is the primary source of subtle bias.

Subtle Bias:
- Often a single word or phrase
- Slightly shifts perception
- Becomes stronger through repetition

Examples:
- “slain” vs. “killed”
- “claims” vs. “stated”
- “only recently introduced”

Overt Word Choice Bias:
- Clearly evaluative or polarizing
- Can stand alone as bias

Examples:
- Biased For: “efficient”, “tireless”, “excellent”
- Biased Against: “lazy”, “weak”, “incompetent”

Rule:
If bias cannot be clearly categorized elsewhere but relies on polarizing wording, classify it here.


6. FLAWED LOGIC BIAS

Bias created through logical fallacies that influence perception of the Philippine Government.

Includes:
- Hasty generalization
- False cause
- Slippery slope
- Black-and-white thinking
- Appeal to authority
- Appeal to groupthink
- Red herring


BIAS STRENGTH AND SCALES

Subtle Bias:
- Slight influence on perception
- Often cumulative
- One instance alone may not justify labeling the article as biased

Overt Bias:
- Strong influence on perception
- A single instance may be sufficient


ARTICLE-LEVEL CLASSIFICATION

5-Point Scale:
- Slightly Biased:
  - One overt bias instance OR
  - Multiple subtle biases
- Biased:
  - Multiple overt bias instances OR
  - Repeated subtle bias forming a clear partisan narrative

3-Point Scale:
- Biased:
  - More than two overt bias instances OR
  - Enough subtle bias to form a partisan view
- Neutral:
  - Below these thresholds


SECTION 2 — WHEN BIAS SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE ANNOTATED

DO NOT ANNOTATE WHEN:

1. Charged words are factually accurate
   Example: “The AFP killed individuals during a military operation.”

2. A charged word is contextually appropriate
   Example: “Communist” alone is neutral; “communist rebels” may be biased outside a military context.

3. Factual correctness is the only issue
   Truth or falsehood alone does not imply bias.

4. Bias targets a foreign government only
   Exception: If used to promote or undermine the Philippine Government.

5. Government agents criticize other government agents
   Annotate the actions being criticized, not the critic’s role.

6. Regional, legislative, or judicial bodies are the focus
   Only annotate national executive branch entities.
   Exception: Regional offices of national agencies.

7. Quotes are purely descriptive or balanced
   Summaries of speeches alone are not bias.


ANNOTATE WHEN:

1. Language affects perception of government performance or intent.
2. Word choice frames actions as heroic, malicious, or illegitimate.
3. Quotes are repeated excessively or drown out opposing views.
4. Motives or intentions are assumed without attribution.
5. Charged wording is unnecessary given the context.


CRITICAL GUARDRAIL

The presence of charged or emotional wording alone is not sufficient for annotation.
Bias must influence interpretation, not merely describe events.
