    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ordered the review and overhaul of two performance evaluation schemes due to its duplication with existing mechanisms—a move that may affect bonuses given to government employees. Executive Order No. 61 suspended the implementation of the Results-Based Performance Management System and Performance-Based Incentive System, which are effectively bonus schemes. Likely to be affected are the performance evaluation schemes called Productivity Enhancement Incentive, an across-the-board P5,000 bonus given before Dec. 15 of every year, and the the Performance-Based Bonus which may reach up to two months’ worth of a government worker’s basic salary. Both are under the Performance-Based Incentive System. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/454317/public-school-teachers-slam-performance-bonus-introduced-by-palace#ixzz8cZvkk7Pg\">Public school teachers slam performance bonus introduced by Palace</a></strong> EO 61, dated June 3, said both the Performance-Based Incentive System and the Results-Based Performance Management System are “duplicative and redundant” with internal and external audit and evaluation systems and lacked a review mechanism. To review and streamline the bonuses, the President created a technical working group (TWG) composed of the budget secretary as chairperson and the executive secretary as cochair, with the finance secretary, socio-economic planning secretary and director general of the Anti-Red Tape Authority as members. <h2>Transition plan</h2> The TWG will submit recommendations to the President within six months and create a transition plan for the grant of a new performance-based bonus to government employees within the next three months. The new bonus scheme will “integrate, streamline and align the new government performance management system” with other programs and systems as provided for by existing laws and issuances. “The new government performance management and incentives systems shall be aligned with ease of doing business initiatives, the Philippine Development Plan, the socio-economic agenda of the administration and international standards and best practices,” EO 61 read.",

The Sona will set the tone for our legislative agenda, and we are more than ready to take the necessary actions to achieve our shared vision for a better Philippines,” he added. Romualdez further reminded House members that it was their duty to work together, “transcending political differences,” to enact laws that uplifting Filipinos’ lives. Apart from placing priority on measures outlined in the Sona, the Speaker assured the public that the House would prioritize the passage of the P6.352-trillion proposed national budget for 2025 and the remaining three of 28 Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council priority bills.

At the sidelines of a “Brigada Eskwela” event at the Neptali A.

Angara said there was a slow turnover of positions among public school teachers due to a “block” in the Teacher 3 rank. “So above the Teacher 3 position, we will create other teaching positions to pave the way for those down the ranks,” he said, adding that the new ranks would be “plantilla” positions.

Citing the 2021 labor force survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, the CPD said the labor force participation rate is lower for women at 51.2 percent, compared to men at 75.4 percent. As such, the unemployment rate is higher for women at 8.2 percent compared to men at 7.5 percent. There is also a higher proportion of unpaid family women workers, 11.3 percent, compared to men, 4.7 percent. According to a study released in February by the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department, a think tank of the House of Representatives, more female than male workers have completed secondary and college education. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://entertainment.inquirer.net/600270/womens-month-11-fearless-female-characters-who-redefine-empowerment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women’s Month: 11 fearless female characters who redefine empowerment</a></strong> The study, citing the 2021 labor force survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, showed the percentage of women who have completed college at 14.5 percent, compared with the percentage of men at 10.5 percent. Women also dominated completion levels for secondary education at 84.8 percent, as compared with the men’s completion rate at 81.4 percent. <strong>READ:<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.net/womens-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#HerStory: Women Transforming Society</a></strong> In a statement, CPD executive director Lisa Grace Bersales said: “We have come a long way, but we still have more work to do. We need more opportunities, particularly in fields that are dominated by men.” <h2>Family planning</h2> The CPD said the rising numbers of women using family planning methods are “a remarkable progress in the empowerment of women.” It cited a Department of Health report in 2023 showing that more than 8.6 million Filipino women were using family planning methods, higher than the 2022 figure of 8.3 million. “This corresponds to the country’s current state, showing that births among women are lower, at 1.9 children, which is below replacement level,” the CPD said. For modern methods of family planning, pills remain to be the most popular method, with 34.48 percent of the total current users, and injectables coming in second at 20.66 percent. <h2>Implants</h2> Implants had the highest increase in the numbers of users, growing by 24.11 percent. Bersales emphasized the importance of data—particularly disaggregated data—to enable targeted programming and ensure that vulnerable groups, specifically women and girls, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and those in isolated and disadvantaged areas, are effectively reached. The advancement of women from different demographics is among the main thrusts of the Philippine Population and Development Plan of Action 2023-28 that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. approved in November 2023.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Next year’s proposed funding for the feeding of children of P15.795 billion is 45 percent higher than this year’s P10.89 billion and may mean 857 million meals for nutritionally deficient kids. “Never has the budget for child feeding been supersized to this big. On this, the government has put its money where its mouth is,” House Deputy Speaker and Batangas Rep. Ralph Recto said over the weekend, noting that the program was “unprecedented.” A check of the 2024 National Expenditure Program showed that the <a href=\"https://www.deped.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Education</a> (DepEd) requested P11.711 billion for its school-based feeding program, while the <a href=\"https://www.dswd.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Social Welfare and Development</a> (DSWD) asked for P4.084 billion for its supplementary feeding program. These sums are higher than the P5.69 billion and P5.2 billion approved for these programs under the 2023 spending law. The proposed funding for feeding programs for kids in 2024 is P4.9 billion higher than this year’s approved allocations. <h2>Big catering operation</h2> Recto said the P15.795 billion may translate to 857 million meals for nutritionally deficient children, at current prices. “Costing for 2024 might still be adjusted to inflation, but it will not change the fact that the two agencies will have in their hands a big catering operation next year,” he said. Recto cited data from the two agencies, which showed that for 2023, the DepEd will provide 1,678,704 students one meal a day for 120 days, while DSWD will serve one meal for 120 days to 1,754,637 beneficiaries. The DepEd’s school-based feeding program caters to students from Kindergarten to Grade 6 who come from indigent families and are suffering from child wasting or stunting. On the other hand, the DSWD’s supplemental feeding program is for children aged 3 to 5 years old who are placed in daycare and other child development centers. <h2>Better canteens sought</h2> Recto said the increase in the budget for school-based feeding should be accompanied by higher funding for food preparation and handling facilities, cooking equipment, and canteens. “Procuring more of these serves a dual purpose as these facilities can become teaching laboratories for senior high students taking culinary classes under the technical-vocational track. They can feed the body and feed the mind at the same time,” he said. He added that the P15.795 billion funding for the two agencies may also help local farmers and food producers if schools will buy from them. “In essence, it is a food purchase budget, which can be spent locally, resulting in a virtuous cycle wherein food grown by the village will end up being consumed by their children,” Recto added. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1703436/hunger-in-ph-real-solutions-needed-astronaut-meals-not-included\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hunger in PH: Real solutions needed (astronaut meals not included)</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1684002/deped-plans-to-transfer-feeding-program-to-lgus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DepEd plans to transfer feeding program to LGUs</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1681160/in-finland-school-meals-keep-students-going\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In Finland, school meals keep students going</a></h3>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A total of P544 billion in lump sum appropriations in the proposed budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for 2023 may just end up as pork barrel of lawmakers, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III warned on Sunday. “Budgeting via lump sums does not conform to the spirit and requirements of our budget law and policy,” Pimentel told the Inquirer. “Lump sum funds lack details. The policy of the law is ‘line item budget,’ meaning ‘as detailed as possible.’ Lump sum [budgeting] is the work of lazy people,” he added. Such budgeting practice, he noted, “lacks transparency. Hence, it is not to be desired.” “What I fear the most is that it could be a rich source of pork barrel funds. That is why DPWH should disaggregate them and publicize the details immediately,” Pimentel said in a separate statement. In 2013, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional the allocation of pork barrel, officially known as Priority Development Assistance Fund, and similar lump sum allotments in the national budget. According to the Senate minority leader, the unspecified allotments were about 75 percent of the DPWH’s proposed budget of P718 billion as stated under the Marcos administration’s P5.3-trillion <a href=\"https://www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/dbm-publications/national-expenditure-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Expenditure Program</a> (NEP) for next year. Last week, the House of Representatives concluded its plenary debates on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s first national spending program as it approved the NEP, which would then be transmitted to the Senate as the General Appropriations Bill. “This is no small amount,” Pimentel said. “Every peso in the budget should be disaggregated. Hiding billions of pesos in lump sum funds is nothing new. Let’s shun this practice.” Among the questionable outlay was P214 billion for “convergence and special support programs,” which included P105 billion for Sustainable Infrastructure Projects Alleviating Gap and P52 billion for Basic Infrastructure Program. <strong>RELATED STORIES</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1664488/pork-trading-replaces-horse-trading-in-19th-congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pork trading replaces horse trading in 19th Congress</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1673759/koko-having-confidential-funds-not-a-deped-norm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Having confidential funds not a DepEd norm – Pimentel</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1672191/minority-calls-out-huge-confidential-funds-in-2023-budget-couldve-been-for-classrooms-cash-aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minority calls out huge confidential funds in 2023 budget</a></strong>",

It was Marcos’ 219th vlog cross-posted on his Facebook and YouTube pages and the third since he took office on June 30. In his latest video, which drew 310,000 views on Facebook and 140,000 on YouTube as of mid-Sunday, the president assured his followers that he was in good health and thanked them for their well wishes on social media, some of which were flashed on screen. “I’d like to report, if you’re wondering where I am making this vlog for you, this is my old bedroom. I used to sleep here when my father was still president,” Marcos said. Malacañang announced on July 8 that the president tested positive for the coronavirus, but he showed no major symptoms except a mild fever. He stressed the importance of getting the vaccine or booster shots. “This is my second bout with COVID but I think that if it were not for the vaccine and booster shot, then perhaps my condition would be a lot worse off,” he said. <h6><em>—DJ YAP</em></h6> <strong>RELATED STORIES</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1628620/bongbong-marcos-ends-isolation-after-bout-with-covid-19-palace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos ends isolation after bout with COVID — Palace</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1627401/bongbong-marcos-now-free-from-covid-19-symptoms-may-end-isolation-on-friday-palace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos now free from COVID symptoms — Palace</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1626019/bongbong-marcos-on-way-to-complete-recovery-after-covid-19-bout-says-doc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos on his way to ‘complete recovery’ after COVID-19 bout, says doc</a></strong> &nbsp;",

    "article_body": "Eager to put the past weeks behind her, Vice President Sara Duterte expressed hope that the criticisms over the lack of transparency in her request and use of confidential funds would “eventually lose its charm,” while deflecting questions about her use of public money by saying Alliance of Concerned Teachers Rep. France Castro and Sen. Risa Hontiveros were being dramatic. On Monday, Duterte thanked President Marcos, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, and Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo for defending how her office got P125 million in confidential and intelligence funds (CIF) when there was no line item for it under the 2022 General Appropriations Act. Several experts, including the Makabayan bloc, former Senate President Franklin Drilon, and former lawmakers Barry Gutierrez and Neri Colmenares, have pointed out that it was unconstitutional to realign funds to nonexistent budgetary items, more so without prior approval of Congress. But instead of answering squarely, Duterte said only she believed “the lies they peddled to the public will eventually lose their charm and the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the Department of Education (DepEd) will persist and be vindicated.” <strong>‘Flair for drama’</strong> She also came after Hontiveros, who interrogated her during the OVP budget deliberations last week and whom she said “amuses the nation with her flair for drama, could only wish the 2022 OVP CIF was accessed illegally.” “It’s a shame they still cannot produce any proof to support their dirty imagination,” she added. Duterte said the arguments on the unconstitutionality of the CIF were “a legal opinion of Ms Castro, who is not a lawyer/auditor.” Castro, who has butted heads with Duterte over her policies at DepEd, led the charge in interrogating the OVP’s confidential funds after discovering that they were spent in just 19 days last year. Hontiveros, for her part, on Monday reminded Duterte that she is “not special.” “Given the significant responsibility of government officials, I demand a shred of competence when it comes to fiscal matters—like any Filipino taxpayer,” Hontiveros said in a statement. Contrary to the Vice President’s claim that the senator was just “amusing” the public with her “flair for drama,” Hontiveros said she was just doing her job to scrutinize the spending plans of the OVP like all other state agencies. <strong>Secret funds for DMW</strong> “No drama. We just work hard,” she said. Amid the controversy over confidential funds, Sen. Raffy Tulfo on Monday sought P25 million in secret funds for the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) to fund its covert operations. The DMW has requested a budget of P15.5 billion for 2024. The proposal, however, was met with opposition by some of his colleagues, including Sen. JV Ejercito, who said it would be better to just strengthen the DMW’s existing programs to combat human trafficking. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III and Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva also expressed their reservations over Tulfo’s suggestion.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Healthcare workers have slammed the proposal of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) to implement “exit credentials” to address the shortage of nurses in the country, calling it a mere “band-aid solution.” Ronald Ignacio, a registered nurse and one of the conveners of United Private Hospital Unions of the Philippines, said such a plan would affect the quality of care provided by Filipino nurses to patients. “I think it is a mere band-aid solution. This isn’t long-term. And [patients] would question the quality of service because [the nurses] don’t have experience,” he said at a recent press briefing. Filipino Nurses United vice president Leni Nolasco also criticized the CHEd’s plan as the government should instead solve the problem of low wages that discourage registered nurses to practice their profession, thereby causing understaffing in hospitals. Nolasco told the Inquirer on Saturday that there was “no shortage issue, but understaffing” in hospitals. “Raising the salaries of private health workers to match those in the government is a good start. But the nurses’ salaries are not enough,” she said. Her group has demanded a P50,000 starting salary per month for nurses in the country, calling it a “living wage.” President Marcos earlier directed the CHEd to carry out interventions to curb the growing number of nurses who either migrate abroad or switch to a more stable career. Last month, CHEd Chair Prospero de Vera III said his agency would facilitate the signing of memoranda of agreement between the private sector and higher education institutions on the direct hiring of nursing graduates in healthcare facilities, particularly those with “exit credentials.” The proposed shorter program will allow those who completed only one to three years of nursing studies to join the profession and augment the medical workforce. Based on data from the Department of Health, about half of the 316,405 licensed Filipino nurses had migrated to other countries. According to Nolasco, a third of this number have chosen not to practice nursing and instead look for more lucrative job opportunities. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1751515/scholarship-return-program-eyed-to-solve-nurses-shortage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scholarship, return program eyed to solve nurses shortage</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1750723/zubiri-want-nurses-to-stay-in-ph-then-increase-their-salaries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zubiri: Want nurses to stay in PH?

EO No. 44 also directs the agency to work with other government offices and local governments which, in turn, are ordered to provide the DSWD their full support and cooperation. In addition, the DSWD was tasked to determine the “appropriate staffing pattern and corresponding qualification standards” for the creation of additional positions for the administration and operation of the food stamp program. The department must also submit to the <a href=\"https://www.dbm.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Budget and Management</a> the proposed changes in the agency’s organizational structure and staffing pattern. <h2>Development goals</h2> The food stamp project aims to lower the incidence of voluntary hunger in low-income households by providing P3,000 in financial aid through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, which can be used to buy selected food commodities from eligible partner merchant stores. A whole-of-government approach is required for the program to succeed, as the EO itself noted. Its implementation is in line with the country’s commitment to realizing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal No. 2 of ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030.

We, of course, we have to apologize to our kababayans who, especially those who came from abroad because their vacation is limited,” Marcos told reporters in an interview after he inspected Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) Terminal 3. Despite the airport chaos, Marcos believed that airport authorities and his Cabinet officials “have done a reasonably good job,” saying that “six hours is rather a short time considering how much [was] needed to be done to get the system back up into working condition.” <h2>‘Back to normal’</h2> He said operations at Naia were now “back to normal” but he said the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (Caap) must have “a proper backup system” to prevent similar incidents happening in the future. “That’s why we are asking for your forgiveness. But we’ll do everything we can to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he assured travelers. <h2>Proper backup system</h2> He ordered Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista to “fast-track” all negotiations for the upgrade of equipment at the country’s airports. “What I told [Transportation] Secretary Jimmy [Bautista] is to make sure that we fast-track all of—whatever negotiations we have with our—with the equipment suppliers who can help us with the upgrades, for the software and the hardware of our equipment,” he said. “And beyond that, is to have a proper backup system so if the whole system fails, like it did on Jan. 1, we have a complete system ready to go,” he added. On New Year’s Day, about 56,000 passengers were stranded at Naia and other airports in the country after 361 flights to and from Manila were either canceled, diverted or delayed. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have called for an investigation of the fiasco. <h3></h3> <h3>RELATED STORIES:</h3> <h3 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1712172/senators-seek-thorough-probe-of-naia-fiasco\">Senators seek thorough probe of Naia fiasco</a></h3> <h3 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1711413/naia-power-outage-tech-glitch-shut-ph-airspace#ixzz7pdgspadj\">Naia power outage, tech glitch shut PH airspace </a></h3>",

Conducted between Dec. 12, 2024 and Dec. 18, 2024, the survey showed that 41 percent of Filipinos support the Vice President’s impeachment, while 35 percent disagree and 19 percent are undecided. The rest, 5 percent, said they “don’t know enough” about the issue. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2021731/more-endorsers-back-4th-impeach-rap-vs-vp#ixzz8wlgewUMW\">More endorsers back 4th impeachment rap vs VP Duterte</a></strong> According to the survey results, the call for Duterte’s impeachment resonated most strongly in Luzon outside of Metro Manila, with 50 percent advocating for her removal and 25 percent disagreeing with it. Only 18 percent were undecided while 7 percent were not informed enough. <h2>Most opposed region</h2> This was followed by Metro Manila, with 45 percent agreeing to the call for impeachment. A close 37 percent disagreed and only 14 percent said they were undecided. The remaining 4 percent said they did not know enough. Mindanao showed the most opposition, with 56 percent opposing it and 22 percent advocating for it. The region had an undecided rate of 18 percent and 4 percent uninformed. The Visayas had the highest percentage of undecided respondents at 24 percent, in contrast to 40 percent who agreed, 33 percent who disagreed and 4 percent who did not know enough. Among socio-economic classes, support for the impeachment was strongest among Classes ABC, with 50 percent agreeing, 34 percent disagreeing and 14 percent undecided. Opposition to the impeachment was strongest in Class E, with a disagreement rate of 36 percent; however, the agreement rate in this sector was 37 percent, while the undecided rate was 20 percent. <h2>Refusal to answer</h2> Across sectors, 2 percent of Class ABC, 5 percent of Class D and 7 percent of Class E said they lacked knowledge about the issue. The survey results also showed that 46 percent of Filipinos believe the unexplained spending of confidential funds by the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education may be the best basis for Duterte’s impeachment. Her refusal to answer investigations into these funds was also a concern for 36 percent of Filipinos. Accusations of ill-gotten wealth that could not be explained in her statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN), and threats to the lives of prominent figures, including President Marcos, also ranked highly with 25 percent and 24 percent of Filipinos, respectively, believing them to be possible bases for her impeachment. <h2>Other issues</h2> Other allegations include Duterte’s involvement in extrajudicial killings during her tenure as Davao City mayor (23 percent), her failure to condemn China’s aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea (13 percent), her display of lack of self-control (12 percent), her trip to Germany during the onslaught of Typhoon “Carina” (11 percent), and ordering her subordinates to prepare accomplishment reports on the distribution of confidential and intelligence funds, supported by fabricated receipts and documents (11 percent). Around 17 percent of Filipinos stated that none of the mentioned allegations may be the basis for her impeachment.

DOTr Secretary Vince Dizon first identified the ROW issues as the main reason for the delays of the many flagship and priority projects of the administration when he recently met with Senate Deputy Majority Leader JV Ejercito. <strong>READ:<a href=\"https://business.inquirer.net/507850/dizon-wants-to-solve-right-of-way-issues-that-delay-govt-infra-projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dizon wants to solve right of way issues that delay govt infra projects</a></strong> &nbsp; “His (Dizon) concern is the right of way and that’s the one that’s really causing the delay of the projects and at the same time it was placed in the unprogrammed funds for a while,” Ejercito said in a Zoom interview on Wednesday. The senator was asked if there was a commitment from the DOTr about the major infrastructure projects that may be completed before the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., ends in 2028. Ejercito lamented the delays in the implementation of some projects that fell under the government’s unprogrammed funds in the past budget law. <h2>Programmed allocation</h2> This was also the reason he insisted that all flagship programs should fall under the programmed allocation. But the DOTr is not just hoping for allocation but legislation that would address the ROW issues to expedite the completion of the government’s priority projects, according to the senator. “He emphasized that for the project to move forward, there really needs to be a budget allocation, and at the same time, the right-of-way bill must be passed so they won’t keep encountering difficulties—since legal issues are usually the main problem,” Ejercito said in Filipino. “That’s what he requested, along with airport upgrades, to help decongest NAIA,” Ejercito added. In particular, Dizon talked about allowing other provincial airports to operate at night to “spread out the flight, instead of all trying to beat the 5 o'clock sunset limitation.” /MR",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) plans to carry out an ongoing trial run of African swine fever (ASF) vaccines bought from Vietnam in even more areas to help hog farmers find a cure for the viral disease. In a statement on Monday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the DA “[would] cast a wider net” to include areas in Luzon and regions designated as red zones (with active ASF cases) in Visayas and Mindanao. He added that 150,000 doses of the ASF vaccine would be used to inoculate hogs in La Union, Quezon, Mindoro, North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Cebu provinces as part of the controlled testing being conducted by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://plus.inquirer.net/business/da-expecting-440000-asf-vaccines-to-arrive-in-oct/\">DA expecting 440,000 ASF vaccines to arrive in Oct</a></strong> Commercial pig farms in areas with numerous infections will also be covered to safeguard their stocks. All vaccines will be provided free of charge. “Our goal is to ensure a steady supply of pork in the market and stabilize prices,” Tiu Laurel said. This marked the first time the government conducted controlled vaccine testing after it recorded the first ASF outbreak in the country in 2019. The DA earlier earmarked P350 million for the program: P300 million for the procurement of about 600,000 doses of Vietnamese-made ASF vaccines and P50 million for inoculation-related costs. The first shipment covering 10,000 doses arrived last month. Another 150,000 doses were later delivered, but these have yet to be used. Among the initial recipients of the ASF vaccines in an inoculation drive conducted on Aug. 30 were 41 hogs in Lobo town, Batangas province—ground zero of the ASF resurgence in the country. Five of the hogs, however, eventually died, Lobo Mayor Lota Manalo said during a hearing conducted by the Senate committee on agriculture, food, and agrarian reform. Over the weekend, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa said the remaining 440,000 doses were expected to arrive and be released within October to sustain the government-controlled vaccination campaign. The country has active ASF cases in 14 regions, 31 provinces, and 109 municipalities, based on the BAI’s tally as of Sept. 6. ASF is a highly contagious viral disease afflicting domestic and wild pigs with a possible mortality rate of 100 percent, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. While considered not a danger to human health, the disease can have devastating effects on pig populations and the farming economy. The industry-wide losses to the country’s swine sector have been estimated at around P100 billion. The total swine inventory also dipped by 2.1 percent to 9.86 million heads as of September last year, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.",

According to the DSWD, a total of 18,055 college students will undergo a five-day training program for its cash-for-work tutoring program, called “Tara, Basa!” tutoring program, next month. Other topics to be discussed in the mentor training sessions are basic gender and cultural sensitivity, financial literacy, and an “in-depth orientation” on their tasks as tutors and youth development workers. “We are preparing these students not just to teach, but to become holistic support systems for both children and parents,” DSWD spokesperson Irene Dumlao said in a statement. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://opinion.inquirer.net/178877/reviving-basic-education\">Reviving basic education</a></strong> A guidebook for tutors and a workbook for learners will also be provided to the program participants to serve as their reference materials in the sessions. These were developed by the DSWD with the Ateneo Center for Educational Development and the Department of Education. The tutors and youth development workers, mostly education majors in college, will receive compensation based on the prevailing regional daily minimum wage rate over the 20-day learning session. Tutors will guide elementary students having difficulties in reading, while the youth development workers will hold “Nanay-Tatay teacher sessions” with the parents or guardians of the students to espouse “positive parenting” and other related topics such as Filipino family dynamics and understanding oneself as a parent. One of the tutors in the program, third-year college student Jomel Sabalboro from Albay, said that his role goes beyond teaching, as it is important to also “create meaningful learning experiences tailored to the needs of the struggling learners.” <h2>Teachers’ training, too</h2> “I thought my role was simply to teach struggling readers using printed materials, like storybooks. However, through the sessions, I realized that my responsibilities go far beyond that,” he said in the DSWD statement. For this year, the program, deemed supplementary learning sessions, was further expanded to a total of 12 regions, namely Metro Manila and the regions of Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Soccsksargen, and Caraga. It had a pilot run in Metro Manila when it was launched in 2023, before it was introduced to six other regions.",

Marcos said there were six or seven major <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1858826/dof-chief-diokno-maharlika-fund-irr-revisions-within-bounds-of-law\">changes</a> and they dealt with the powers and authorities of the board of directors of the Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC) that will manage the fund. The revised rules also gave the President freedom to accept or reject nominees to the MIC board, an advisory body to be composed of the finance, budget socioeconomic planning secretaries and the national treasurer. The president said he preferred to let the board of directors decide as much as possible even with the choice of people, and the structure of the organization. “As much as possible, on the day-to-day workings of the fund, we leave it to the board. We leave it to the managers,” Marcos said, reiterating that “I do not want political forces to interfere with financial decisions of the investment fund.” The president did not specify what “political forces” he meant but stressed that the MIC was not any different from other government corporations, like the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines, which will provide the bulk of MIC’s capitalization.",

Acuzar said President Marcos has instructed the NHA to finish all the YPHP units in Eastern Visayas. “All the Yolanda Housing Projects will definitely be completed this year,” Acuzar said. The housing units are located in Cool Spring Residences, Riverside Community Residences, Mont Eagle Ville Subdivision, Coconut Grove Village, Dagami Town Ville and Pastrana Ville in Leyte; Marabut Ville Sites 1 and 2 in Samar; and Culaba Housing Project in Biliran. <h2>Turnovers ongoing</h2> Qualified YPHP beneficiaries are families displaced by Yolanda in November 2013 and are residing in identified hazard-prone areas. On Friday, Mr. Marcos led the ceremonial turnover of 3,517 housing units in Burauen, Leyte. The President also instructed the DHSUD and NHA to research other housing designs that are appropriate for and can withstand climate change and natural disasters. <strong><em>—PNA</em></strong>",

PAF 15th Strike Wing commander Brig. Gen. Juliano Llarenas said during the decommissioning ceremony over the weekend that a contract was signed for six additional Super Tucano aircraft on Dec. 27. “Hopefully, the notice to proceed will be issued today,” he said during the ceremony on Saturday at Sangley Point in Cavite City, which was aired live on Facebook. He did not provide details. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2017034/keep-modernization-a-priority-marcos-tells-paf-at-turnover-rites#ixzz8vuk2zUb9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keep modernization a priority, Marcos tells PAF at turnover rites</a></strong> Brazil’s Embraer SA delivered the first batch of six Super Tucano aircraft for the PAF worth P4.698 billion in 2020. But even with the additional aircraft, the PAF has a long way to go to reclaim its title of being the finest in the Asean region. <h2>Lack of funds</h2> Over the years, its air assets have declined with no replacements coming in due to funding problems and the painstaking process involved in the country’s military modernization program. The last two OV-10 Broncos retired over the weekend were operated by the 15th Strike Wing, which is responsible for tactical and close air support for the military’s ground operations. The PAF unit used to operate over 30 aircraft, which were acquired from the United States and Thailand, making the OV-10 its stalwart workhorse since the 1990s. The two AH-1S Cobras, the PAF’s first pair of dedicated attack helicopters, were donated by the Kingdom of Jordan only in 2019. These were previously operated by the Royal Jordanian Air Force and Israeli Air Force. Sourcing spare parts, however, became a challenge in maintaining the ageing air assets, prompting the PAF leadership to decide to finally retire them, Llarenas said in his speech. “We do not mourn an end but celebrate a legacy. Their decommissioning marks the culmination of years or decades of steadfast service and heralds a new era of innovation and progress built upon the foundation of their enduring contribution to our nation’s defense,” he said. The Philippines was one of the last operators of the legendary Vietnam War vintage OV-10s, which patrolled the West Philippine Sea and saw action in numerous internal security operations against the New People’s Army and Abu Sayyaf Group, including the Marawi siege in 2017.

(PhilHealth) is set to increase again the benefit package for each session of hemodialysis, which will lessen the out-of-pocket payments of patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5). But there’s a catch: Despite the increase in the benefit package, the PhilHealth board has also allowed private dialysis providers to charge patients out of pocket, if there are services needed beyond the “minimum standards of care.” According to Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa, chair of the PhilHealth board, PhilHealth increased the new rate to P6,350 from the previous P4,000 per dialysis session in both public and private dialysis units. Herbosa said the decision to increase the cash rate by 58.75 percent was reached by the board on Wednesday, “following the guidance of President Marcos” <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1945943/philhealth-eyes-100-percent-hike-in-coverage-for-dialysis-patients#ixzz8lutSs8j6\">PhilHealth eyes 100 percent hike in coverage for dialysis patients</a></strong> Last week, Herbosa convened the PhilHealth benefits committee, which heard feedback from hospitals, dialysis centers, and the Philippine Society of Nephrology about the “persistent challenges of dialysis.” Herbosa said “we have also reminded [the PhilHealth] management to work fast on urgent care and emergency benefits to complete the picture,” referring to the needed circular and operationalization so that the higher rate can be claimed. This will be the second time this year that the health insurance agency increased its case rate for hemodialysis since June. PhilHealth earlier increased the case rate from P2,600 to P4,000 for each hemodialysis session for CKD5 patients. It also increased the maximum number of hemodialysis sessions from 90 to 156, equivalent to P990,600 a year under the new rate. But now, nephrologists in private dialysis units are allowed to bill an additional fee of up to P450 for services rendered and private dialysis centers can charge for medicine or procedures not considered under minimum standards. This also means that only publicly accredited dialysis centers are prohibited from billing additional charges to their CKD5 patients under the “no balance billing” system. Based on the current circular, included in the minimum standards for CKD5 patients are erythropoietin, intravenous iron sucrose, and heparin or enoxaparin. There are also eight laboratory tests, which a CKD5 patient may take “any or all, as needed:” complete blood count; serum creatinine; hepatitis profile; alkaline phosphatase; potassium, phosphorus, calcium; serum iron/ferritin/transferrin; total iron binding capacity; and albumin.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Labor groups marked Bonifacio Day on Saturday with protest-marches on España Boulevard and Mendiola Street in Manila to demand government action on pressing issues confronting workers amid bickering by the country’s various political factions. The Nagkaisa Labor Coalition reiterated its call for a legislated wage hike of P150 or more and the abolition of provincial rates to help workers cope with the rising cost of living. It also renewed pleas to government to abolish contractualization in both public and private sector. The coalition lamented that while marathon hearings continue to be held at the House of Representatives on the war on drugs of the previous administration and the alleged misuse of confidential funds by the Vice President, the labor committee stopped deliberating on the legislated wage hike. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2010863/despite-scrapped-house-hearing-vp-duterte-still-no-show-at-nbi#ixzz8t5inpl3C\">Despite scrapped House hearing, VP Duterte still no-show at NBI</a></strong> While exacting accountability from the past administration is “a good agenda” to pursue, Nagkaisa said sidelining key labor reforms, such as legislating wage hike and ending labor contractualization, is tantamount to “perpetuating a state of national calamity.” Nagkaisa also emphasized the compounding effects of recent typhoons, which have devastated communities across the country. “This situation reflects decades of government neglect and the self-serving priorities of political dynasties, reaffirming Bonifacio’s belief that there can be no ‘kaginhawahan’ (comfort) ‘kalayaan’ (freedom) from this kind of rule,” it said. The coalition argued that both the coalescing and warring political dynasties are importunate barriers to genuine progress for Filipino workers. <h2>Who will benefit?</h2> The Partido Manggagawa said that amid the “intense” political infighting between the camps of the President and Vice President, “workers [should] choose no sides and will not join any ‘fake people power,’” according to Judy Miranda, the group’s secretary general. This was also the sentiment of the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP) and the Kilusang Mayo Uno. “When the new year entered, both the Marcos and Duterte factions did not attend to anything, but their rivalry for the 2025 and 2028 elections. The continuing and intensifying telenovela of the antagonistic ‘Team Kasamaan’ and ‘Team Kadiliman’ is getting tiresome. These are the [political] dynasties that have been neglectful of the poverty [among Filipinos] and which prioritize the interest of their clans,” BMP said in a statement.",

The DOTr underscored on Sunday that this strategy, which would support vital economic sectors like agriculture and trade, was part of the Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028. “New linkages and strategic location of new ports will be assessed to create new rural growth areas. The capacity of Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off) facilities will be increased and processes will be digitized to address congestion and delays,” the DOTr said. Electronic terminal management systems such as electronic ticketing will also be implemented and streamlined while aging fleets will be replaced or retrofitted to mitigate the risk of maritime accidents, it added. Meanwhile, the Maritime Industry Development Plan will continue to be implemented through maritime education, technology and innovation. <h2>Complete missing links</h2> The DOTr also plans to upgrade land routes aligned with the nautical highway network and complete the missing links in the road network by constructing viable inter-island bridges. “Road transport corridors leading to airports and ports will be upgraded, including installation of weighbridges to prevent overloading,” it said. Also on Sunday, the DOTr reiterated its plan to give pedestrians and cyclists the highest priority in the hierarchy of road users. “Provisions for active mobility will be integrated into the transportation system. Existing thoroughfares and bridges will be redesigned and retrofitted for the protection and expansion of bikers and pedestrians,” it said. <h2>Bike-only roads</h2> To ensure safe and well-connected active mobility networks, the DOTr intends to widen sidewalks, develop greenways, car-free zones, and bike-only roads and reconstruct intersections. “Local governments and private developers will be incentivized to have pedestrian-friendly and bikeable developments and programs,” the DOTr said. The local governments will also be encouraged to monitor walk scores, walkability, bikeability, and accessibility within their jurisdictions. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1708570/ppa-passenger-count-in-ports-reaches-pre-covid-levels-during-christmas-rush\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPA: Passenger count in ports reaches pre-COVID levels during Christmas rush</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1636061/normal-operations-no-major-structural-damage-in-eight-ports-after-abra-earthquake-ppa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Normal operations, no major damage in 8 ports after earthquake – PPA</a></h2>",

Up until now they have not captured Quiboloy, then there is the escape of dismissed Bamban Mayor Alice Guo as well as the failure to capture former prisons chief Bantag,” Castro pointed out, adding, “Through the years hundreds of billions have been poured to intelligence funds but it seems that it has just become a slush fund when it could have been used for education and social services.” She cited CIF concerns raised by the COA, which has “repeatedly noted the main issue in confidential and intelligence funds—they escape genuine audit and public scrutiny, while the ones handling them escape accountability to the taxpayers.” According to the lawmaker, HB 7158 seeks to rectify the supposedly “unconstitutional” allocation of CIF which was “free from audit, public scrutiny and official accountability.” She pointed out that its passage was crucial in ensuring government funds are used properly and safeguarding the public interest, saying, “It is high time for the government to rectify this unconstitutional mode of allocating intelligence and confidential funds.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To ensure the protection of students against abuse, the <a href=\"https://www.deped.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Education</a> (DepEd) is looking at boosting its Child Protection Unit (CPU), which formulates policies related to children’s rights in basic education. “We would like to strengthen [it] because it’s mostly [an] advocacy at this point,” Michael Poa, spokesperson for DepEd, said at the National Children’s Month press briefing on Tuesday. According to him, the CPU will hold a “child protection specialization course” for focal persons in regional and school division offices in November. “There is also a training needs survey that is being conducted in order to identify the training that should be provided at the school level,” Poa said in a Viber message to the Inquirer. “Aside from these, information drives will be undertaken which will include the dissemination of IEC (information, education and communication) materials on bullying at the school level,” he added. DepEd earlier launched hotlines to receive complaints about abuses being committed in schools following reports about sexual abuse cases involving teachers at the basic education level. During the press briefing, the <a href=\"https://www.cwc.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Council for the Welfare of Children</a> (CWC), an interagency body mandated to protect minors, said that it would also introduce a hotline called “Makabata Helpline 1383” to deal with child rights’ violations. CWC executive director Angelo Tapales said the hotline would complement those being operated by the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) and other concerned agencies. He added that since the Philippines did not have enough resources to support the big infrastructure needed for a centralized emergency hotline, those set up separately by different agencies should complement each other with the aid of a proper referral system. “In the helpline, NCMH is focused on mental health while we are focused on the violation of children’s rights. We would start with violence and dangers that they might be facing,” Tapales said. “What we need is a proper referral system,” he added, noting that if the caller was seeking treatment or therapy, that person should be directed to the agency specializing in those areas. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1682703/hontiveros-hails-blocking-of-20-child-abuse-sites-new-anti-osaec-law-is-working\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hontiveros hails blocking of 20 child abuse sites: New anti-OSAEC law is working</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1679199/3-fold-surge-in-online-child-abuse-cases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solon seeks probe into ‘three-fold surge’ in online child abuse cases</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/851437/cwc-unicef-bare-results-of-national-study-on-child-abuse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CWC, Unicef bare results of national study on child abuse</a></h2>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The majority of senators will have the final say on whether or not the 2025 funding of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) will be increased, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada said on Sunday. “My stand is, it depends on the majority. And if it will redound to the benefit of the people, why not? But it still depends on the decision of the majority in the Senate,” he said in an interview with radio dzBB. Sen. Joel Villanueva on Friday said at least four or five senators have so far signified their intent to increase the 2025 funding of the OVP. “I’ve spoken to like four or five members who share my view of increasing the budget of the OVP from that in the GAB passed by Congress,” he said. Estrada clarified that he was not among the lawmakers Villanueva was referring to. “Senator Joel hasn’t spoken to me about it yet. I was not part of the conversation about whether or not the OVP funding will be increased,” Estrada said. <h2>Not enough</h2> Asked if he himself would agree to increase the OVP budget, he reiterated that it would depend on the majority in the Senate. “If it’s necessary that we give [an increase], then give it. If not, then don’t,” Estrada said. It will be known during the budget approval this week whether the Senate would increase the OVP budget or if it would just adopt the P733-million budget approved by the House of Representatives. Villanueva, in an interview with reporters on Friday, said he has been vocal about his stance on the P1.29-billion cut in the OVP’s funding made by the House. “As I mentioned earlier, I’m also in that position to somehow increase the budget, not necessarily restore everything... I don’t look at personalities; I don’t look at whatever some politicians are looking at right now; I’m just after the office itself. The Office of the Vice President deserves more,” he pointed out. “We have yet to discuss the exact amount. [But], for me, at least P100 (million), P150 (million) is decent enough to increase the budget. So, we’ll see. On our end, we listen to both camps and the positions of our colleagues. And whatever the consensus is, I will respect the decision of the whole Senate,” he added. <h2>Mixed sentiments</h2> Villanueva also said he could not see a justified reason for the OVP’s fund to be slashed in half. During the Senate plenary deliberations on the OVP’s proposed 2025 budget, senators approved its P733 million outlay, adopting the House version that slashed the original P2.03 billion proposal. However, Vice President Sara Duterte had secured a promise from her allies in the chamber, Senators Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa and Christopher “Bong” Go, to either give additional funding to the OVP or restore its massive budget cuts during the period of amendments. Sen. Grace Poe, the Senate finance committee chair and principal sponsor of the budget said the P733 million earmarked for the OVP was not yet final as senators may still propose to either increase or decrease it, subject to the body’s approval.",

(Included are the electoral code, revenue code, local government code, and IP code.) Galvez said Marcos has also ordered him to help the BTA, noting that achieving peace in Mindanao is “very important” for the President. “Sinasabi nga po ng ating mahal na Presidente na siya ay handang tumulong sa ating Bangsamoro Transition Authority para mapadali po ang lahat ng mga gawain po nila,” Galvez said. (Our beloved President said he is willing to help the BTA members to make their tasks easier.) Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11593 in 2021, which postponed the BARMM elections scheduled for this year, thus extending the BTA's transition period until 2025.

It is an attempt by the group to convince the Senate to convene as an impeachment court and immediately start the impeachment trial of Duterte. But, according to Escudero, “No amount of signatures will amend the law nor convince me to violate it by convening the impeachment court during recess and without complying with the requisite conditions precedent.\" https://youtu.be/T4rNdxrwFL8 “The law is not bendable and should not bow to anyone’s dictate simply because of their own desire, bias and timetable of wanting to rush the impeachment proceedings against VP Sara…” the Senate chief stressed. Escudero has repeatedly said that the Senate can only convene as an impeachment court in an open session. But the Articles of Impeachment against Duterte were only transmitted to the Senate by the House of Representatives two hours before the upper chamber adjourned its session on February 5.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — In preparation for the first phase of the “Matatag” curriculum’s implementation next school year, the Department of Education (DepEd) will begin training teachers and school leaders from Jan. 22 to April 4. “Matatag” is a revised basic education curriculum under the K-12 program that covers kindergarten up to Grade 10. It aims to “produce competent, job-ready, active, responsible and patriotic citizens.” In a memorandum signed on Dec. 20, 2023, by Education Undersecretaries Gina Gonong and Wilfredo Cabral, it said the series of trainings would ensure that teachers and school leaders have an in-depth understanding of the revised curriculum for kindergarten, Grades 1, 4 and 7. “Specifically, it aims to equip teachers and school leaders with the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies to effectively implement the new curriculum in the coming school year,” the officials added. According to the memorandum, lead trainers, including directors of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines, chiefs and training specialists will undergo the preparation work first from Jan. 22 to Jan. 26. <h2>Maximize teachers’ load</h2> In the next weeks, the training will be implemented at the national, regional and division levels with teachers from kindergarten, Grades 1, 4, and 7 starting a one-month school-based training on the new curriculum on March 4. But even before that, a quality assurance and finalization of the curriculum training resource package will be done from Jan. 8 to 19, DepEd said. To ensure that all teachers concerned would be able to attend the training, school heads were advised to implement strategies like maximizing the load of those from other grade levels who would not be participating. They may also schedule a half-day training for Kindergarten, Grades 1, 4, and 7 teachers totaling 40 hours to avoid disrupting regular classes. For those who could afford it, school heads may consider hiring substitute teachers, or tapping teacher applicants for voluntary service during the training period.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo Loyzaga flagged the increasing extraction of deep-sea minerals during a side event at the ongoing global climate talks in Dubai, as she cited the need to further study and establish governing policies and rules on the issue. “We wish to note with concern the lack of knowledge we have of these environments and the consequence of their physical, chemical, and biological disruption,” Loyzaga said during the forum titled “No Paris without the Ocean: Partnerships to Activate Ocean-Climate Solutions at Scale.” Loyzaga, head of the Philippine delegation to the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or COP28, stressed the need to safeguard and restore the “blue carbon ecosystem,” specifically dealing with deep-sea economic activities like mineral extraction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, deep-sea mining refers to the process of retrieving mineral deposits from the ocean below 200 meters. There is currently little data that could help in understanding the ecological relationships and impacts associated with deep-sea mining, based on a 2022 policy brief by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). Despite this, it said that “current scientific consensus suggests that deep-sea mining will be highly damaging to ocean ecosystems.” <h2>‘Risk to the ocean’</h2> While there are many existing ocean-linked sectors that could potentially contribute to the “sustainable blue economy,” the UNEP FI said this was not true for all sectors. “The extraction of nonrenewable marine resources such as oil and gas and seabed mineral deposits in particular poses a significant risk to the ocean and cannot be considered sustainable,” it said. Loyzaga, for her part, emphasized that countries need to look beyond their national jurisdiction in the high seas to safeguard and protect the integrity of marine ecosystems. She likewise cited the need to align efforts with the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement and the High Seas Treaty, or the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). The landmark BBNJ document was agreed upon in June after almost two decades of negotiations. It is the first-ever treaty intended to protect the world’s high seas, or the ocean area beyond the countries’ exclusive economic zones. As of September, nearly 70 countries, including the Philippines, have ratified the treaty during the UN General Assembly.",

In Proclamation 627 dated July 9, Mr. Marcos urged the public to cooperate with the PSA and “provide truthful and complete information in response to census questions, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations.” He stressed the importance of the census as it “equips government executives, policymakers and planners with current and comprehensive population data to develop informed social and economic development plans, policies and programs.” The President earlier called for a census update on the list of beneficiaries in the government’s social protection programs. <strong>READ: <a class=\"sc-cBIjbw bLUVIX\" href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1457031/filipinos-now-total-109-million\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Growing, growing, growing!

In a joint press release on Sunday, a day before World Health Day, toxics watchdog EcoWaste Coalition and Action on Smoking and Health-Philippines (ASH Philippines) pointed out the difficulty in collecting and recycling the waste left behind by tobacco products. “The only solution to tobacco and related product waste is upstream, meaning keep them from being produced, marketed, and used in the first place,” said ASH Philippines executive director Dr. Maricar Limpin. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://opinion.inquirer.net/181184/the-long-fight-against-tobacco-epidemic\">The long fight against tobacco epidemic</a></strong> According to EcoWaste and ASH Philippines, there is “no reasonable method” that can be used to collect waste products such as discarded cigarette butts and ESDs. ESDs include e-cigarettes, vapes, or other similar electronic devices that may contain tobacco, nicotine, e-liquids, or derivatives of cannabis. “More importantly, they are full of carcinogens and toxins. Any product they are made into will also be full of carcinogens and toxins, not to mention the danger to those working in recycling facilities,” the groups added. ASH Philippines and EcoWaste Coalition called on smokers and vapers to quit and for nonsmokers not to start smoking. <h2>DOH denies donations</h2> Meanwhile, the DOH has maintained it did not receive any donations from antihealth industries. “The DOH continues to refuse and reject all proposed donations by the tobacco industry, whether to its officials or the agency or its units,” the health agency said in a statement over the weekend. “We are saddened that some may have fallen victim to industry tactics of divide and conquer,” it added. Health advocacy groups earlier slammed Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa and called for his resignation for posing for a photo with executives from a tobacco company. They pointed out that his presence in ceremonies for the donation of four mobile clinics donated by Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco Corp. Inc. and the Lucio Tan Group Inc. to the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Malacañang on March 20 was illegal and unethical. <h6>—WITH A REPORT FROM DEXTER CABALZA</h6>",

STORY: Coast Guard to have 24,500 men by end of 2022\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" /> MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is expected to have 24,500 personnel by year-end when new recruits complete their training, PCG commandant Adm. Artemio Abu said during the agency’s 121st anniversary on Wednesday. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. served as the guest of honor at the event held at Port Area in Manila, where he acknowledged the agency’s role in being on the front line in defending the country’s maritime territory and other law enforcement duties. The PCG only had 8,500 members in 2016, but it conducted its biggest single enlistment in September and recruited 1,500 draftees. The enlistment boosts the agency’s aim to have 35,000 personnel to have enough manpower in addressing maritime challenges and increasing assets. The PCG has expanded its presence through 15 PCG regional districts, 89 stations, and more than 400 substations nationwide, Abu said. He also cited the PCG’s recent efforts and accomplishments in maritime security, search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection. Part of it includes increased patrols in the West Philippine Sea and the installation of sovereign markers or buoys near four islands and reefs in the Kalayaan Islands in May. The PCG ships have also faced China Coast Guard ships head-on in accompanying Philippine supply ships in Ayungin Shoal. “The President has guaranteed that not a square inch of Philippine territory will be abandoned to another nation. Rest assured that the Philippine Coast Guard is committed to the country’s position in ensuring territorial integrity,” Abu said. <strong>RELATED STORIES</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1681988/bongbong-marcos-backs-pcgs-modernization-efforts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos backs PCG’s modernization efforts</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1574256/pcg-reports-ccg-close-distance-mauevering-in-bajo-de-masinloc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PCG reports China Coast Guard’s ‘close distance maneuvering’ anew in Bajo de Masinloc</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1651658/ph-coast-guard-gets-p11-million-equipment-donation-from-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PH Coast Guard gets P11 million equipment donation from US</a></strong>",

The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has approved a budget of P113.75 billion for SUCs in the 2025 National Expenditure Program (NEP), down from last year’s P128.13 billion. Under the 2025 NEP, P65.17 billion will go to personnel services, P39 billion for maintenance and other operating expenses, and P9.54 billion for capital outlay. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1836579/huge-cut-in-budget-of-state-universities-colleges-hit/#ixzz8m6err58H\">Huge cut in budget of state universities, colleges hit</a></strong> The P14.38 billion was taken from the budget for capital outlay, which, according to the SUC officials, cover facilities, equipment, and “other investments” that would serve them for periods beyond 2025. <h2>Appeal to lawmakers</h2> In a unity statement, they called on Congress to restore the slashed budget and to augment the higher education funding for next year. “Additional budget is needed for our learning institutions to regain their public character and provide ample support for student services and faculty development. If our SUCs are expected to carry out their duties as higher education institutions, they must be funded accordingly,” the officials said. Among those who signed the statement were presidents of the University of the Philippines System, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Mindanao State University System, Philippine Normal University, Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University, University of Southeastern Philippines, University of Northern Philippines, University of Rizal System, Cavite State University, Bicol University and Zamboanga State College of Marine Sciences and Technology. <h2>Education crisis</h2> They lamented the crisis in the country’s higher education system, saying, “Going through the world’s worst and longest school closure has had lasting impacts on the educational community and has presented challenges for administrators, teachers, staff and students alike.” “Academic spaces have been shrinking and becoming less conducive, and the services that enable a student to learn unhampered leave more to be desired,” they added. According to them, it was important now more than ever for the government to “recognize, respect, and uphold the Filipino people’s right to education.”",

Romel Lopez, spokesperson for the DSWD, said the cash assistance would be distributed through the agency’s Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP), the same source of funding for the financial aid given to rice retailers. Under the cash assistance program of the government, a retailer can receive P15,000 as financial aid to cope with the <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/?top-story=rice-price-cap-may-be-lifted-after-harvest-marcos-hints\">rice price cap</a> set by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier this month to arrest the skyrocketing prices of rice. The government has already started the distribution of cash assistance days after the price cap took effect, beginning with rice retailers. This time, the DSWD, which was tasked with distributing the financial assistance, will be making the payouts to qualified variety store owners this week. Lopez explained that the DSWD would prioritize its payout on sari-sari store owners who sell rice within the price cap of P41 per kilo for regular-milled rice and P45 for well-milled rice. The store owners must also have their businesses registered with the Business Permit and Licensing Office of their local governments. The store must also have a barangay registration and participate in the nano-retailer program “which is supported financially by their [local government] in order to qualify for the program and be eligible to receive the cash aid,” Lopez explained.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Erwin Tulfo’s designation as Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) secretary may be in limbo as the powerful legislative <a href=\"https://comappt.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Commission on Appointments</a> (CA) on Tuesday deferred his confirmation due to legal issues over his citizenship and criminal conviction for libel. As if turning the tables on Tulfo, CA members quizzed the former broadcaster and tabloid columnist about his personal life and previous careers before joining the Marcos administration. The DSWD secretary-designate is one of the four Tulfo brothers in the broadcast industry, whose brand of brash journalism has earned them huge followings on social media. His younger brother, Raffy Tulfo, was elected senator in May. Speaking with reporters after the three-hour proceedings, Tulfo admitted he became an American citizen in 1988. He regained his Filipino citizenship only this year as part of the requirements for his appointment as a public official. He added that he had anticipated the matter to be raised at the hearing. “That’s why I brought the documents with me. I came prepared,” he said. “The decision [regarding my confirmation] will be in their hands.” The issue was raised by Caloocan City Rep. Oscar Malapitan, who disclosed that Tulfo was a member of the US military from 1988 to 1992 as stated in the report given to CA members. <h2>Joined US military</h2> Sagip Rep. Rodante Marcoleta said Tulfo’s records also revealed he was in “active military service stationed in Europe” from 1992 to 1996. “Did you renounce your Filipino citizenship?” Malapitan asked Tulfo. Instead of directly answering the question, Tulfo moved for a closed-door session with the CA members, who swiftly granted his request. After an hourlong executive session, Bacolod City Rep. Greg Gasataya, who presided over the proceedings, adjourned the hearing and deferred Tulfo’s confirmation as the CA discussed his predicament. Tulfo later clarified that he had applied for American citizenship not because of his decision to join the US military. “I cannot divulge that. I’m sorry,” he told reporters. But Marcoleta pointed out that only individuals who had secured their American citizenship either by birth or naturalization may serve in the US forces. He also noted that Tulfo was previously found guilty of libel, an offense deemed as a crime involving turpitude. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1696326/erwin-tulfos-libel-conviction-raised-in-ca-debates-on-his-appointment-as-dswd-chief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erwin Tulfo’s libel conviction raised amid DSWD appointment debate</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1653999/no-tulfo-apology-aide-says-he-was-taken-out-of-context\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No Erwin Tulfo apology; aide says he was taken ‘out of context’</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1664908/erwin-tulfo-dswd-budget-for-aid-now-stands-at-less-than-p1-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erwin Tulfo: DSWD aid budget is less than P1 billion and running low</a></h2>",

Francis Escudero on Saturday called on the government to refrain from imposing more taxes that will deal a heavy blow to poor Filipinos, and instead be open to collecting more taxes from the wealthy. Escudero made the suggestion as he criticized Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno who dismissed proposals to impose taxes on luxury goods and services. “I am not in favor of any tax, but if there is any type of tax that we need to impose, it should start with discussions on it and not for [officials] to immediately reject the proposal and resort to tax alternatives that will burden more of our people, including the poor,” he said. He was referring to Diokno’s pronouncements at a House hearing that rejected plans to impose tax on luxury goods. “They [at the <a href=\"https://www.dof.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Finance</a>] are saying [tax on luxury goods] is difficult to implement because owners such as diamonds can just hide the luxury items. But let us not forget that luxury items are not limited to diamonds; these can be expensive cars — that cannot be easily hidden,” he said. <h6>—MELVIN GASCON</h6> <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1815156/at-house-budget-talks-lawmakers-resurface-tax-on-rich-proposals\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">At House budget talks, lawmakers resurface higher taxes for rich individuals</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1812361/ease-of-paying-taxes-bill-to-become-law-in-2-months-says-salceda\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Salceda: Ease of paying taxes bill to become law in 2 months</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1787231/more-taxes-eyed-to-raise-funds-to-implement-uhc-law\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">More taxes eyed to raise funds to implement UHC Law</a></h3>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Neophyte House lawmakers on Monday advised Vice President Sara Duterte to attend both the congressional inquiry into her alleged misuse of public funds and the National Bureau of Investigation’s probe of her supposed kill threat against President Marcos. At a press conference on Monday, 1-Rider party list Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez stressed that both the inquiry by the House committee on good government and public accountability and the NBI investigation were legal processes requiring compliance. The NBI earlier required Duterte to appear before it on Nov. 29 to explain her “active threat” to have Marcos, his wife Liza and Speaker Martin Romualdez assassinated should she be killed. But this was moved by the NBI to Dec. 11 after she asked for it to be rescheduled, saying she wanted to attend the House hearing set on Nov. 29. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2010863/despite-scrapped-house-hearing-vp-duterte-still-no-show-at-nbi#ixzz8tHFoAbGK\">Despite scrapped House hearing, VP Duterte still no-show at NBI</a></strong> However, the House panel, which is looking into allegations that over P600 million in funds given to the Office of the Vice President and Department of Education were misused from 2022 to 2023, called off its hearing to avoid any conflict with Duterte’s NBI appearance. “I don’t understand why it would be easier to commit to one and not the other,” Gutierrez said. He was referring to Duterte’s statement that she would choose appearing before the House panel chaired by Manila Rep. Joel Chua over abiding by the NBI summons. <h2>Legal processes</h2> “I think she should commit to both because these are both legal processes that have to be complied with ... I hope that’s what she does,” Gutierrez said. Assistant Majority Leader and Lanao del Sur Rep. Zia Adiong, on the other hand, pointed out that Duterte’s appearance in both proceedings was only “proper and was how an official respects the rule of law.” “It’s not really a matter of choice. I think it’s proper, and it’s how an official respects the rule of law,” Adiong said, adding that the Vice President should deal squarely with the NBI probe. “So it’s not really a choice between which do you favor: the committee hearing or the NBI. Both are important,” he pointed out. For her part, Assistant Majority Leader Amparo Maria Zamora slammed Duterte’s claim that the presidency was already hers in 2022, saying, “Then why didn’t she run if she had it in the bag? I mean, it’s already [almost] 2025, why is she just saying that now?”",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Assistant Minority Leader Arlene Brosas on Tuesday called on the Commission on Audit (COA) to deliver on its commitment to complete its audit of the Office of the Vice President’s (OVP) P125 million in confidential funds in 2022. In a statement, Brosas, a Gabriela party-list representative, reminded the COA of its promise to finish the audit by today (Nov. 15). The agency made that commitment during plenary debates in late September on House Bill No. 8980, or the 2024 General Appropriations Bill. It was during the plenary debates that the COA confirmed the <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1836566/ovp-secret-funds-spent-in-11-not-19-days-quimbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OVP spent the P125 million in just 11 days</a>. Through its budget sponsor, Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo, who is senior vice chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, the COA corrected Brosas and other Makabayan bloc lawmakers who had earlier reported that the money, transferred from the Office of the President’s contingent funds, was spent in 19 days. Brosas replied: “It’s hard to comprehend that if that is for surveillance, how many reward payments have been made to spend P11 million per day... Did the OVP submit a liquidation report to the Office of the President, president of the Senate, and speaker of the House?” Quimbo replied that the liquidation report was submitted by the OVP on Jan. 17, 2023, and that the COA was doing an audit of such expenses and had committed to finish its audit of the P125 million by Nov. 15. <h2>Call for transparency</h2> Brosas said: \"We believe that the Filipino people have the right to know how public funds are being utilized, especially when it involves significant amounts such as the OVP's P125-million corruption-prone confidential funds transferred from the Office of the President and spent within just 11 days in 2022.” She stressed that it was also “crucial that the full audit report of all government agencies be made available to the public.” “We need transparency and accountability in the handling of public funds to ensure that they are used for their intended purpose and not for personal gain,\" Brosas added. The lawmaker noted that the issue of confidential and intelligence funds has been rightfully criticized by the public because the funds are not subject to genuine audit and public scrutiny which, she pointed out, created a loophole allowing those handling them to evade accountability. “We urge the government to address this issue and ensure the responsible utilization of public funds. It is crucial that confidential funds undergo the same audit procedures implemented in any other government expenses,” Brosas said. <h2>Realignment</h2> Mounting opposition among lawmakers to the granting of confidential and intelligence funds to civilian agencies eventually led to the realignment of these allocations mainly to agencies involved in protecting the country's interest in the West Philippine Sea, such as the Philippine Coast Guard. The biggest was Vice President Sara Duterte’s proposed budget of <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1857675/sara-gives-up-seeking-p650m-in-secret-funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">P650 million in confidential funds for 2024</a> — P500 million for the OVP and P150 million for the Department of Education (DepEd) which she heads as concurrent secretary.",

He said the department’s target was to administer by the end of August all 391,860 Pfizer bivalent vaccine doses received from Lithuania on June 3. “However, it took us until this September to consume all the 390,000 doses,” he said. He added the Philippines had requested around 2 million more bivalent vaccines from the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility. “[At this rate] we may not be able to use them up, especially if they have short shelf lives,” Herbosa said. He added the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines has slowed down worldwide. “Generally even in other countries, people are no longer scared of COVID-19. That’s why we have these donations,” said Herbosa. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1812722/bivalent-covid-shot-coverage-expanded\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bivalent COVID shot coverage expanded</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1812184/doh-chief-covid-19-bivalent-vaccine-now-available-for-general-population\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DOH chief: COVID-19 bivalent vaccine now available for general population</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1796107/fda-bivalent-jabs-need-prescription\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bivalent COVID-19 jabs need prescription – FDA</a></h3>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Another petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to declare the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA) unconstitutional for allegedly circumventing the constitutional directive to allocate the biggest budget to education. The Teachers’ Dignity Coalition, Freedom from Debt Coalition, and the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates submitted a petition for certiorari and prohibition on Monday, asking the high tribunal to strike down the 2025 GAA, or Republic Act No. 12116, for violating Section 5(5), Article XIV of the Constitution. It mandates that “the State shall assign the highest budgetary priority to education and ensure that teaching will attract and retain its rightful share of the best available talents through adequate remuneration and other means of job satisfaction and fulfillment.” <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://opinion.inquirer.net/179773/curing-the-2025-national-budget\">Curing the 2025 national budget</a></strong> They also urged the high court to issue a temporary restraining order and a writ of prohibition, directing the President to desist from implementing the 2025 national budget and prohibiting the respondents from disbursing public funds for its enforcement and implementation. Named respondents in the case, docketed as G.R. No. 279199, are President Marcos, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. <h2>P1.05-T allocation</h2> Under this year’s national budget of P6.326 trillion, the education sector is receiving the highest allocation at P1.05 trillion. However, the petitioners argued that the education sector’s budget was only significantly increased by aggregating nontraditional education-related funds from various agencies and offices. These included funding for the Philippine Military Academy, the Philippine National Police Academy, the Philippine Public Safety College under the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Local Government Academy, the National Defense College of the Philippines, and the Philippine Science High School System and the Science Education Institute, both under the Department of Science and Technology. This same argument of “bloating” the education budget was also raised in earlier petitions challenging the 2025 GAA. “The inclusion of noneducation-related spending strays from the functional composition of the education sector, namely the Department of Education, state universities and colleges, the Commission on Higher Education, and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, which collectively garnered a combined budget of P913 billion, a poor second to infrastructure,” the petitioners argued. They also cited education data from global and national institutions revealing that “education in the country is in crisis.” “Never before has there been a more unjust and callous national budget in this country. The petitioners, thus, urgently implore this honorable Supreme Court to correct this gross injustice,” they said.",

DOH officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Thursday the health department had already instructed all hospitals in the country to be on code white, the lowest alert level that directs them to activate manpower and facility resources and form a team solely for firecracker casualties. “All the hospitals have been told to prepare for firecracker injuries,” Vergeire said at a press briefing. “We are now in code white, meaning all are instructed to prepare, all are instructed to have a special team to address the concerns of people who are going to our hospitals with injuries due to firecrackers.” https://youtu.be/iq5ow0dTYTU <h2></h2> <h2>Preparedness urged</h2> &nbsp; Under the code white status, medical personnel are placed on an “on-call status for immediate mobilization” to ensure the readiness of the hospital to respond to emergencies, whether injuries or poisoning incidents due to firecrackers. Based on the latest DOH data, 36 firecracker-related injuries were reported from Dec. 21 to Dec. 29, an increase of 44 percent from the same period last year. Of the latest count, four new cases were recorded on Thursday. The prohibited “boga,” an improvised cannon made with polyvinyl chloride pipes, is the top culprit of injuries, with 14 cases, or 39 percent, of total cases. This was followed by whistle bombs (four cases); five star and “kwitis,” a permissible rocket fireworks, (three each); and “camara” (one). No ingestion of fireworks or stray bullet injuries were reported. Vergeire and other health officials made hospital rounds in Metro Manila on Thursday to inspect the emergency response of hospitals ahead of the New Year’s Eve celebrations. At a press briefing, Vergeire attributed the slight increase in reported firecracker injuries this year to the more relaxed mobility restrictions, as well as the enhanced surveillance of the DOH of other diseases and health emergencies.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Valenzuela City is the latest local government shutting its doors on Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos), whose contributions to the economy tend to be overshadowed by their increasing association with crime, particularly human trafficking involving Chinese nationals. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mayor Wes Gatchalian said the city council had passed three ordinances prohibiting all forms of gambling in the city, including Pogos. He thus ordered the suspension of new applications also for the operation of Small Town Lottery (STL), online cockfighting, online bingo, and online poker, among others. Valenzuela City remains without any Pogo establishment but currently has nine STL operators, he noted. <h2>‘Moral, social impacts’</h2> The mayor said he signed the ordinances to preempt any of the “social impacts’’ arising from the proliferation of illegal gambling, such as human trafficking, money laundering, prostitution, and kidnapping. He recalled that during a raid on an unauthorized cockfight or “tupada” in Barangay Lingunan in May 2021, a teenager was shot dead by the police during the commotion. “In my view, Philippine resources end up being used to deal with complaints arising from Pogos,” the mayor said. While there may be “economic benefits” from hosting such companies, he said, they have also proven to have “moral and social impacts” that the city government now wants to prevent. “That’s why I’m making this preemptive move before they reach Valenzuela,’’ Gatchalian added. The recently passed ordinances penalize violators with fines ranging from P100,000 up to P500,000, according to Councilor Ricar Enriquez, the majority floor leader. <h2>Pasig initiative</h2> A ban on Pogos and other forms of online gambling took effect also in Pasig City in December last year. In signing Ordinance No. 55, series of 2022, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto gave companies running e-games, “e-sabong,” e-bingo, online poker and casinos, and computer gaming stations one year to wrap up their operations and leave the city. In September 2022, following reports on a spate of serious crimes, including killings and abductions, the Senate moved to ban Pogos nationwide. That same month, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said illegal Pogo workers would be summarily deported. As of June 2023, there are 33 licensed Pogos listed by the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. From P7.18 billion in 2020 (the first year of the pandemic), the taxes collected by the Bureau of Internal Revenue from Pogos and their service providers went down by 46 percent to P3.91 billion in 2021, according to the Department of Finance. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1749508/pagcor-pressed-to-shut-down-pogos\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pagcor pressed to shut down Pogos</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1794003/ph-now-hotbed-of-human-trafficking-because-of-pogos-says-gatchalian\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PH now a ‘hotbed of human trafficking’ due to Pogos, says Gatchalian</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1777017/hontiveros-bares-another-modus-operandi-on-pogo-linked-crimes-this-time-in-pagcor\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hontiveros says Pogos could be in cahoots with Pagcor in committing crimes</a></h3>",

    "article_body": "MAMNILA, Philippines — Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Wednesday questioned the Ombudsman’s procedures in ordering him and several officials to respond to criminal and administrative complaints over the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, while also casting doubt on the filing made by the Senate committee on foreign relations. “It seems the procedure isn’t clear because, before, there was a fact-finding process and rules that were published. This time, it’s like there was no fact-finding at all, it went straight to us,” Remulla told reporters in an interview at the Department of Justice (DOJ). Despite these concerns, he said he would comply with the directive and submit his counteraffidavit. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2058817/ombudsman-orders-remullas-3-more-respond-to-duterte-arrest-complaint\">Ombudsman orders Remullas, 3 more: Respond to Duterte arrest complaint</a></strong> In two separate orders issued by the Office of the Ombudsman on Tuesday, Remulla and his brother, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, along with Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rommel Marbil, PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief Nicolas Torre III, and Special Envoy for Transnational Crimes Markus Lacanilao, were ordered to submit their counteraffidavits within 10 days, along with their witnesses’ affidavits. This is after the Senate committee on foreign relations headed by Sen. Imee Marcos, filed a complaint against them over the March 11 arrest of Duterte and his turnover to the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. <h2>‘Not even a committee report’</h2> Echoing the DOJ’s reply to the petitions filed with the Supreme Court over the former president’s arrest, Remulla said the government did not violate the law when it helped in the arrest of Duterte and his handover to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity for his bloody war on drugs. “We will respond to every issue, that everything that happened was within legal bounds, all of it was according to the law,” Remulla said. The DOJ chief also questioned the complaint, as he criticized the timing of the filing. “It’s actually the complaint itself. I found it a bit strange; it’s not even a committee report. Why the haste? Why not wait for the committee report, since that’s [the result of] the committee’s investigation? What was contained was the chairman’s report; that’s a little strange,” Remulla said. “Once the election is over, that should be the end of it, because it seems like [the investigation] was just in aid of getting publicity for the elections,” he added. /cb/abc",

    "article_body": "&nbsp; President Marcos’ <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1720133/marcos-defends-foreign-trips-kailangan-natin-magpakilala\">nine official trips over the past eight months</a> have yielded P3.48 trillion in investments pledges, according to Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual. Pascual revealed the amount in a meeting with the President and presidential adviser on investment and economic affairs Frederick Go, who is also president and chief executive officer of developer Robinsons Land. During the meeting, Pascual said a total of 116 projects, worth $62.926 billion or P3.48 trillion, were generated from his foreign trips. According to Pascual, the Philippine government reaped $8.48 billion (P468.96 billion) in Indonesia, $6.54 billion (P361.67 billion) in Singapore, $3.847 billion (P212.74 billion) in the United States, $4.62 billion (P255.53 billion) in Thailand, $2.20 billion (P121.68 billion) in Belgium, $24.239 billion (P1.34 trillion) in China and <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1728862/marcos-back-from-japan-we-carry-with-us-over-13-billion-in-pledges\">$13 billion (P719 billion) in Japan.</a> <h2>Details of MOUs, LOIs</h2> In a video message released by the Presidential Communications Office, the President said “we are starting to go into the details” of all the memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and letters of intent (LOIs) signed during his official trips abroad. The Palace press office released the video as the President’s detractors criticized his foreign trips after he spent a weekend in Singapore in October and attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month. The President has made nine official trips, excluding the weekend in Singapore, since he assumed office in June. Three of the trips were state visits (Indonesia, Singapore and China) while the rest were working visits that coincided with multilateral meetings, like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, that any president would be obliged to attend. “I can already report that some of the MOUs that we signed in Indonesia and in Singapore already have results. And in fact, I think in the next couple of weeks, we will be starting to inaugurate some of these projects already,” the President said. <h2>P1.5T projects confirmed</h2> Out of the P3.48 trillion, the Palace said $4.349 billion or P239 billion have materialized with the companies already in the various stages of implementation of their projects in the country. The Palace added that projects worth $29.712B, or P1.7 trillion, have existing MOUs or LOIs while confirmed projects worth $28.863, or P1.5 trillion, were already in the planning stage. “And the next item is going to be, we will have to converge all of the different agencies of government so that we are working off the same plan. That is what we will do because we have to strike while the iron is hot,” Mr. Marcos said. He pointed out that there were many things that should be resolved, particularly rules and regulations that “are not investor-friendly” but he did not identify these regulations. “We’re moving very quickly to, as I say, make sure that while the Philippines is still top of mind of these investors that we immediately explore those opportunities and take advantage of the contacts that we made during these trips,” he said. <h6><em>g/</em></h6>",

The mass was held at the San Miguel Parish Church inside the Malacañang compound and was celebrated by Manila Archbishop Jose Cardinal Advincula and attended by several high-ranking officials of the Cabinet. In his homily, Advincula called on the two top leaders to emulate the two traits of the Good Shepherd, such as the “listening leadership and life-giving leadership.” “As we meet in our offices and conference halls asking questions in our heads, may we be mindful of our people who ask questions on their empty stomachs,” he said. “May we be leaders who listen to our people, especially the poor and marginalized,” he added. Further, Advincula offered prayers for the two leaders to “spend yourselves in the service of the common good” while being “guided by truth.” The prelate likewise urged the public to pray and rally behind the country’s leaders. “Mga kababayan, sa diwa ng bayanihan, sama-sama nating mahalin at paglingkuran ang ating bayan. Ipagdasal natin ang ating mga lider; tangkilikin natin ang kanilang mga mahuhusay at mabubuting hangarin at hakbangin,” he said. (My countrymen, in the spirit of Bayanihan, let us all love and serve our country. Let us pray for our leaders and rally behind their good intentions and plans.) “Kailangan nila ang panalangin at pagkikipag-tulungan natin upang magbunga ang mga pagpupunyagi nila para sa ikabubuti nating lahat,” he added. (They need our prayers and cooperation so that their victory will bear fruits that are good for us all.) Other government officials who attended the Holy Mass include Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo, Social Welfare and Development Secretary Erwin Tulfo, Justice Secretary Jesus “Boying” Crispin Remulla, and Presidential Management Staff Chief Naida Angping. Also present were Interior and Local Government Secretary Benjamin “Benhur” Abalos Jr., Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco, Department of Migrant Workers Secretary Susan “Toots” Ople, NEDA Director-General Arsenio Balisacan, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista, Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra, and Agrarian Reform Secretary Conrado Estrella III. <strong>READ: </strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1619425/its-official-bongbong-marcos-sworn-in-as-phs-17th-president\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener\">It’s official: Bongbong Marcos sworn in as PH’s 17th President</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1619417/fwd-bongbong-marcos-returns-to-palace-pays-courtesy-call-on-duterte-before-inauguration\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos returns to Malacañang, pays courtesy call on Duterte before inauguration</a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <h6>EDV/abc</h6>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) on Friday urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to stop importing fish and instead support agriculture and the fisheries industry. Marcos sits as secretary of the Department of Agriculture in a concurrent position. Ronnel Arambulo, Pamalakaya's spokesperson, suggested that Marcos strengthen local production to make the country's food self-sufficient. \"We expect that the new agriculture secretary will totally abandon the burdening import-liberalization schemes. Instead, he should pivot agricultural policies towards strengthening local production through sufficient government assistance to our fishers and farmers, especially in critical times,\" Arambulo said in a statement. Together with other measures to ensure food abundance, Marcos must fix natural disaster-related problems and restore displaced residents' livelihoods. A major impediment to the growth of the local fishing industry mentioned by Pamalakaya is the large-scale Chinese fishing activity in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) which, by intimidating Filipino fishermen, has led to them abandoning their traditional fishing grounds. Among Pamalakaya's demands are the following: <ul> <li>Economic assistance in times of natural calamities especially typhoons and other ecological disturbances such as fish kill and red tide;</li> <li>Sufficient production subsidy amid soaring prices of oil products and other prime commodities;</li> <li>Ensuring that Filipino fishers can make use of marine resources within the territorial and traditional fishing grounds; and,</li> <li>Prohibition of all types of conversion and reclamation of coastal communities and fishing grounds that displace fishers and destroy marine and aquatic resources.</li> </ul> These policies can boost the productivity of local fishermen, and at the same time help the country to become food self-reliant, according to Pamalakaya. \"These are all doable measures to ensure that we will not fall short on fisheries production and that our country can be food self-reliant. All it takes is the new administration's political will to strengthen our agriculture and fisheries industries by putting an end to liberalization policies that open our floodgates to imported and cheap products to the detriment of our local food producers,\" Arambulo said. Pamalakaya earlier called out Marcos to address China's blockade of traditional fishing grounds in WPS which is part of the Philippine exclusive economic zone, saying that they can no longer bear another six years of \"defeatist collaboration.\" – <em><strong>Nicole Faye Agcaoili, INQUIRER.net intern</strong></em> <strong>RELATED STORY:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/204962/bongbong-marcos-urged-do-something-to-secure-fishing-rights-in-panatag-shoal\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos urged: 'Do something' to secure fishing rights in Panatag Shoal </a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <h6>EDV/abc</h6>",

(PhilHealth)—lately the subject of controversy over the transfer of P60 billion in its unused subsidies to the national treasury—has increased its benefit package for severe dengue from P16,000 to P47,000. The almost 200 percent increase, which took effect on Nov. 1 is in line with the state health insurer’s aim to provide adequate financial risk protection to Filipinos diagnosed with the disease that continues to be a public health risk nationwide. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/600771/philhealth-increases-dialysis-coverage-to-almost-p1-million-per-year#ixzz8rOrOjBFU\">PhilHealth increases dialysis coverage to almost P1 million per year</a></strong> “PhilHealth is committed to supporting Filipinos, most especially during these challenging times,” PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday. <h2>Third highest claims</h2> “With this twofold increase in health insurance coverage for severe dengue, we hope to alleviate the financial burden on affected families. There is no more reason to delay seeking immediate medical treatment upon observing dengue symptoms,” he added. In February, PhilHealth raised its benefit package for “dengue with or without warning signs” from P10,000 to P13,000—a 30-percent increase for inflation adjustment. Last year, it paid P1.53 billion to cover a total of 163,209 claims for the mosquito-borne disease, the third highest number of claims among its members, after pneumonia and acute gastroenteritis. From January to October this year, the Department of Health (DOH) reported a total of 314,785 dengue cases, more than double than the 155,823 cases reported in the same period in 2023. Dengue cases peak during the rainy season, which lasts from June to November. According to the DOH, frequent rains increase the breeding grounds for mosquitoes due to the accumulation of stagnant water in some regions, particularly in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon and Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon provinces). “The DOH assures the public that hospitals are well-prepared to manage cases effectively. This is in addition to the conduct of hospital orientations on Dengue Clinical Practice Guidelines to ensure hospitals and staff are well-equipped,” it said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/actph1982\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alliance of Concerned Teachers</a> (ACT) on Sunday maintained that the move of the Department of Education (DepEd) to ask for a list of those affiliated with their group was a violation of their right to freedom of association and privacy after the agency justified its request. In a memorandum dated June 14, Education Undersecretary Revsee Escobedo instructed regional directors and schools division superintendents to submit a complete list of teachers affiliated with ACT who are availing DepEd’s automatic payroll deduction system (APDS). Aside from ACT, DepEd also asked in separate memorandums lists of those affiliated with the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition and DepEd Teachers’ Union. All documents did not indicate or explain the purpose of the request and DepEd only issued a clarificatory statement on Saturday after the memorandum, which ACT suspected as “profiling operations” of the agency, drew criticisms online. “The sole purpose of consolidating the list of [those availing] APDS from various organizations in the regions is to centralize, connect, update and improve the department’s Human Resource Systems, including the APDS,” the DepEd statement read. <h2>No need for list</h2> DepEd added that there have been “regular complaints” from employees over inaccurate, questionable, and unwarranted salary deductions for loan remittances and membership dues. But according to ACT, there was no need for DepEd to collect the list of their members “as it is DepEd which approves and implements the APDS every month.” The group added that its accredited regional unions that have APDS regularly update their members’ status every month.The new memorandum, ACT said, was only seeking to “stigmatize ACT’s work, repress its advocacies and restrict civic space from teachers and education workers who are critical of the government.” “As with DepEd’s justification that the memorandum was to address employees’ complaints of wrong deductions of monthly membership dues, this can be simply resolved by fixing their record mechanisms without compromising the privacy and safety of all other employees,” ACT said. The group likewise pointed out that it had all the reasons to sound the alarm for there was no guarantee that the documents being requested would not be used against ACT and its members, “knowing that the current Secretary and Vice President Duterte is [engaging in] relentless and malicious red-tagging of ACT,” it said. “This is opening the big possibility of violating ACT’s and its members’ right to association, freedom of expression, and protection of privacy. We urge DepEd to go after abusive loan sharks and lending institutions instead and spare unions and teachers’ organizations,” the group added. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1792870/deped-defends-memo-listing-unionist-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DepEd defends memo listing unionist teachers</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1793067/act-hits-back-at-deped-stop-justifying-profiling-of-our-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACT hits back at DepEd: ‘Stop justifying profiling’ of our teachers</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1790961/deped-hit-for-profiling-militant-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DepEd hit for profiling militant teachers</a></h3>",

And that’s why it has become a priority of this government that we will fight all the poverty. We will put in all the programs so that one day we can say that we are able to give our people, at the very least, the food that they need to survive, the nutrition that they need to survive,” he added. <h2>‘1M food poor’</h2> Present during the program were Vice President Sara Duterte, Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma, Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna, Asian Development Bank Philippines country director Pavit Ramachandran and World Food Program Philippines country director Brenda Barton. According to the DSWD, the program aims to provide food augmentation to 1 million households classified as “food poor” as defined by the Philippine Statistics Authority. Beneficiaries will receive P3,000 in food credits from July to December. After his speech, Marcos distributed the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards loaded with food credits to 10 of the 50 initial beneficiaries, among them pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. The president said that beneficiaries would get not just “all kinds of food,” but those with nutritional value. Gatchalian earlier said that beneficiaries could use their EBT cards at accredited retailers such as Kadiwa stores, groceries, and small supermarkets. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1774391/food-stamps-staving-off-hunger-until-lasting-solution-is-found\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Food stamps: Staving off hunger until lasting solution is found</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1803643/marcos-wants-to-eliminate-hunger-in-ph-by-2028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marcos wants to eliminate hunger in PH by 2028</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1768613/sws-hunger-among-pinoy-families-eased-in-q1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SWS: Hunger among Pinoy families eased in Q1</a></h3>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A 4-year-old boy who accidentally swallowed a “watusi,” a legal firecracker that could be easily mistaken for a candy due to its packaging, was among the latest 13 cases of injuries attributed to pyrotechnic devices. Based on the latest monitoring of the Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, the case of the young boy from the Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon) region was the first confirmed case of firecracker ingestion this holiday season. <h2>Treatment takes time</h2> “As of the latest update from the receiving hospital, the family cannot be reached. The DOH appeals to the parents and family of the patient to please return to the hospital for proper medical attention,” the DOH said in a statement. Health Assistant Secretary and DOH deputy spokesperson Albert Domingo stressed the urgency of seeking further medical care in such cases. “Treatment of poisoning takes time, depending on the causative agent and the situation of the patient,” Domingo explained. Symptoms of watusi poisoning “may manifest in the next few hours and persist for a few days” after ingestion, he added. Watusi, which contains yellow phosphorus, potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate, and trinitrotoluene, is often confused with candy because of its size and color, the DOH noted. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880826/demand-weak-despite-cheaper-fireworks-firecrackers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand weak despite cheaper fireworks, firecrackers</a></strong> <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880576/groups-warn-public-firecrackers-traumatize-pets-bad-for-environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Groups warn public: Firecrackers traumatize pets, bad for environment</a></strong> <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880206/ecowaste-coalition-on-fireworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ditch toxic fireworks and firecrackers, prioritize health — EcoWaste</a></strong> <h2>First-aid measures</h2> Under Republic Act. No. 7183, which regulates the sale, manufacture, distribution, and use of firecrackers, watusi is described as usually “reddish in color, about 1.5 inches in length and 0.1 inch in width, and usually ignited by friction to produce a dancing movement and a crackling sound.”The DOH advised the public to not induce vomiting if a piece of watusi is swallowed and instead bring the patient immediately to the hospital. Another first-aid measure for children is to make them consume egg whites — from about six to eight raw eggs. For adults, eight to 12 raw eggs may be necessary, it added. <h2>Nationwide monitor</h2> The latest cases tallied by the DOH, logged from 6 a.m. on Dec. 27 to 5:59 a.m. on Dec. 28, raised the total number of firecracker-related injuries nationwide to 88, with about a third of them in Metro Manila. The age of the patients ranges from 5 to 49, with a median of 18 years old. The types of firecrackers so far causing most of the injuries were the “boga,” “5-star,” “kwitis,” “piccolo,” “pla-pla,” “whistle bomb” and “luces.” The majority, or 59 percent, of the injuries were due to the use of firecrackers that are listed as illegal, according to the DOH.",

    "article_body": "A year has passed and rights advocates have yet to see improvements in the country’s human rights situation under President Bongbong Marcos, who has “done little” to address this issue, the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Thursday. HRW looked into his efforts to address human rights-related problems since the time of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose administration is accused of killing thousands in his brutal war on drugs. Mr. Marcos has pledged and guaranteed that human rights would be protected during his term and tried to allay concerns of the international community. This was his promise to several Manila-based diplomats who congratulated him on his victory in last year’s presidential elections. In a statement a day before Mr. Marcos was to mark his first year in office, the group said that the drug war killings continued “though at a lower rate.” Philippine authorities “remain responsible” for the alleged extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests of activists and critics of the government, it said. It also pointed to the “baseless prosecutions” of veteran journalist and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and former Sen. Leila de Lima, taking note of her continued detention. <h2>‘Rescind the orders’</h2> Citing data from the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center, HRW said there had been 336 “drug-related” killings since Mr. Marcos assumed power, most of which were carried out during police operations. “Marcos has yet to rescind the orders and other policy statements that underpinned Duterte’s ‘war on drugs,’” it said. “He should formally announce an end to the ‘drug war,’ order investigations into officials implicated in illegal killings, and fulfill his promise to use nonviolent means to address illegal drugs,” it added. <h2>‘Break from the past’</h2> The group also suggested that concerned government agencies should provide “adequate and consistent” support to the families of the drug war victims, especially children. HRW also reiterated its call on the President to cooperate with the investigation of charges of crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Duterte by the International Criminal Court. Bryony Lau, HRW’s deputy Asia director, said Mr. Marcos “needs to do more than issue statements” about democracy and following the rule of law to demonstrate his “genuine commitment” to human rights. “Without concrete action to break old patterns of abuses and secure accountability for past crimes, his words have little credibility,” she said. “Marcos needs to demonstrate a break from the past and show concrete, measurable progress on human rights,” she added. <strong>READ: <a class=\"LinkSuggestion__Link-sc-1gewdgc-4 cLBplk\" href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1344447/hrw-doesnt-buy-dutertes-ejk-probe-drug-gangs-killing-each-other-claim-its-baseless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Duterte’s claim of EJK probe ‘self-serving, without basis’ – Human Rights Watch</a> </strong>",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To help alleviate the burden of soaring domestic fuel prices on fishermen, the <a href=\"https://www.bfar.da.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources</a> (BFAR) is looking at connecting them to oil companies so they can buy petroleum products at discounted prices. “We are exploring the possibility of coming up with a direct sale of diesel for our fisherfolk,” BFAR officer in charge Demosthenes Escoto said. Escoto told reporters that the <a href=\"https://www.doe.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Energy</a> (DOE) was asking for additional details including the list of potential beneficiaries and their respective fuel requirements. <h2>Details, parameters</h2> The BFAR is proposing an industry-to-industry arrangement wherein fishers will be linked to oil companies to enable them to purchase fuel products at lower prices and in bulk. The DOE’s Oil Industry Management Bureau Director Rino Abad confirmed the recent meeting between the two agencies. Abad said the DOE is supportive and willing to help the fishermen at any time but said the BFAR has to provide the necessary details and set the parameters for the planned intervention. “If bulk purchase, there must be a point person and someone will sign a contract. There must be a guarantor. What we’re after is for oil companies to provide them discounts,” Abad told the Inquirer in a phone interview. “We will give them all the data and hopefully they can arrange some sort of an arrangement wherein our fisherfolk can buy fuel at a discounted price. We are trying to pursue it,” Escoto said. The Department of Agriculture is implementing a fuel discount program for farmers and fishers. It was expanded in August this year to include all agricultural commodities. For this year, the agency earmarked P500 billion for this initiative and was later raised to P1.1 billion to provide relief to more agricultural producers. <h2>30% fuel discount</h2> Eligible beneficiaries under the program are entitled to a 30-percent fuel discount, or up to P3,000 per farmer or fisher, upon the purchase of gasoline or diesel from designated or contracted gas stations. With the unabated increase in the prices of petroleum products, many fishers were forced to either abandon their livelihood and find alternative jobs or scale down their fishing activities. About 80 percent of fishers’ earnings go to fuel alone. Because of these, the Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas said fish prices might go up in the last three months of 2022 due to a projected decline in local fish supply. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1656996/pamalakaya-says-proposed-p489-m-fuel-aid-to-fisherfolk-is-insufficient\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pamalakaya says proposed P489-M fuel aid to fisherfolk is insufficient</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1641337/govt-expands-fuel-subsidies-to-farmers-fishers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gov’t expands fuel subsidies to farmers, fishers</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1614936/luzon-fishers-groan-as-fuel-prices-surge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luzon fishers groan as fuel prices surge</a></h2>",

The BCDA said it had identified waste-to-energy technology as a sustainable alternative to landfills, especially amid the continuous increase in waste generated in the country and globally. “The BCDA is committed to adopting smart and green innovations to push for the sustainable development of our properties. Utilizing waste-to-energy technology, in particular, will modernize solid waste management and promote green energy, helping usher Clark’s transition toward a circular economy,” said BCDA president and chief executive officer Joshua Bingcang in a statement. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://business.inquirer.net/500491/bcda-conducting-study-for-waste-to-energy-facility-inside-clark#ixzz8yjjlWLPw\">BCDA conducting study for waste-to-energy facility inside Clark</a></strong> The BCDA said it is currently studying a proposed waste-to-energy facility “in an optimal location in Tarlac,” to boost power supply and serve the requirements of locators and investors in Clark. “With waste-to-energy technology, the BCDA can do its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also addressing the energy requirements of our community,” Bingcang said. According to the agency, its waste-to-energy study would include site selection and technical, environmental, social, legal, financial, and economic analysis for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Once the study is completed, the project will be opened for public bidding under Republic Act No. 11966 or the Public-Private Partnership Code of the Philippines and its implementing rules and regulations. The waste-to-energy project is also in line with the Marcos administration’s thrust to bolster solid waste management initiatives in the country. “It will complement the government’s Kalinisan sa Bagong Pilipinas Program, which calls for investment in programs, projects, and activities on solid waste management and ecological practices,” said the BCDA. According to a 2018 World Bank study, global annual waste generation is projected to jump to 3.4 billion tons by 2050. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from solid waste treatment and disposal, primarily driven by open dumps and landfills without gas collection systems, reached 1.6 billion tons in 2016, and is anticipated to increase to 2.6 billion tons by 2050.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) is working with the University of the Philippines (UP) on a recommendation to trim down to just 25 of the 133 generals in the Philippine National Police. Interior Secretary Juanito Victor “Jonvic” Remulla, who earlier said that reforming the national police force was a priority, stressed on Tuesday the need to address “redundancies” in the PNP’s “top-heavy” hierarchy to make it more efficient. The President, Remulla reported in a press briefing at Malacañang, was “very accepting” of the possible recommendations to be finalized by the DILG within four months. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1990763/jonvic-remulla-takes-oath-before-marcos-as-new-dilg-chief#ixzz8pPwXNQLq\">Jonvic Remulla takes oath before Marcos as new DILG chief</a></strong> “We’re working together with the UP College of Public Administration to get complete details on how we can reform the PNP’s very top-heavy structure. I think we have 133 generals and I want to whittle that down to 25 so that the organization is more flat,” Remulla said. “It’s the plan; it’s one of my recommendations to flatten the organization,” he added. Remulla pointed out that there were a lot of police generals without commands or groups to supervise. “We have Area Police Commands that do not have actual personnel under them. So we have many areas that have redundancies that need to be trimmed down. It’s a law that needs to be revisited, so those are the things that we will examine,” Remulla said, referring to Republic Act No. 6975 that created the PNP under the DILG. He noted that under civil service rules, police generals were qualified to be promoted every three years, resulting in many of them ending up without a command to supervise. “We want to change a lot of that, to make it five years so that the rate of promotions is slower,” Remulla said. As for current police generals, they would be allowed to remain in the service until their retirement at 56 years old, he added. The DILG chief, who assumed office two weeks ago, expressed optimism that the proposal would not demoralize key senior police officials. “I don’t think so. They’re also soldiers. They follow orders. It’s recommendatory so far so we’ll see,” Remulla said.",

The number of new reported cases last year was 21 percent higher than in 2021 when 12,339 persons were diagnosed with HIV, or an average of 34 new cases per day. In 2017, an average 30 persons in the country were diagnosed with HIV. The DOH also reported that 4,377 more people were diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) last year, which is higher than the 3,871 new AIDS cases diagnosed in 2021. HIV is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system, making the infected person more vulnerable to other infections. If not treated, HIV can lead to AIDS. While there is currently no effective cure for HIV, it can be controlled through proper medical care. Since the country’s first HIV case was reported in 1984, there have been 109,282 confirmed cases reported in the DOH registry. Sexual contact among males who have sex with males has been the predominant mode of transmission among the total reported cases. Before 2007, the predominant mode of transmission was sexual contact between males and females. Last year, 14,637 new HIV cases said they were infected through sexual contact: 10,006 cases were infected via male-to-male sex; 2,970 cases via sex with male and female partners, and 1,661 cases via male-to-female sex.",

    "article_body": "The government officially launched on Wednesday the bivalent COVID-19 vaccination in the country. Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa received his bivalent COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, thus becoming the first recipient in the National Capital Region. This as Herbosa presided the launch of the bivalent vaccination at the Philippine Heart Center in Quezon City. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. also graced the event. In his speech, Marcos renewed his call for Filipinos who remain unprotected against COVID-19 to get vaccinated . \"Let this occasion serve as a call to every Filipino to continue doing your part, get updated on your COVID-19 vaccination, to prevent the resurgence as a means of honoring those who sacrificed their lives during the pandemic,\" Marcos said. \"I thus appeal to everyone, especially those who have yet to receive their primary series of vaccinations, to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This is not for your own good alone but also for the protection of your families and the general public,\" he added. Blood pressure up Meanwhile, Herbosa said that after the vaccination, his blood pressure went up. \"Talagang due na talaga ko sa healthcare worker, siyempre priority kami and I'm also 65 so andoon ako sa both A1 and A2 category,\" he told reporters. (I'm already due given that I'm a healthworker and we are included in the priority sector. I'm also 65 so I'm included in the A1 and A2 category.) \"Mataas daw BP ko after the injection, 160 eh so pinaupo ako. Huwag daw akong tumayo,\" he added. (My blood pressure went up so they asked me to sit. They told me not to stand up.) The Department of Health (DOH) has said bivalent vaccines provide protection against the original COVID-19 strain, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. Herbosa earlier said those who would be prioritized in the bivalent vaccination are the elderly and the healthcare personnel. A total of 2,900 bivalent doses were given to the Philippine Heart Center. Around 2,500 employees of the hospital are expected to be vaccinated in three days. These bivalent vaccines were part of the over 390,000 doses donated by Lithuania early this month. Herbosa said negotiations are ongoing to acquire more bivalent vaccines as he admits that the donated ones are not enough. \"Definitely kulang no, we're actually happy na mayroong dumating. If you remember, OIC Usec. [Maria Rosario] Vergeire was saying dadating earlier and then naantala, napunta sa ibang bansa. Tapos buti na lang ang Lithuania binigyan tayo,\" Herbosa said. (Definitely, it's not enough, we're actually happy that they arrived. If you remember, OIC Usec. Vergeire was saying it will come at an earlier time and then it was delayed. It was brought to other countries, then Lithuania donated.) \"The negotiation for the next million doses is continuing and we will acquire the subsequent doses both from COVAX at also 'yung procurement na bibilhin natin para lahat ng elderly at vulnerable ma-cover natin,\" he added. —KG/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Top national security and foreign relations experts underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving disputes and preventing war in the West Philippines Sea (WPS). “I think [President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.] has paved the way for that future trajectory of where we're going. So, he's saying, 'Let's just continue dialoguing, constructive dialogue, and the like, and diplomacy,'” National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos said in a statement. Carlos said, “You don’t choose. Play smart. Define what your goals are as a nation. Play your game well. This is now a new Philippines. A newfound confidence about who we are.” For her part, former Ambassador and former Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rosario Manalo also said that diplomatic solutions are the way to prevent escalation of the present state of affairs. “The value of diplomacy when it comes to the blue economy is to prevent war. War brings about the end of our existence,” Manalo said. “There are three modes of settling disputes. The first one is called the diplomatic process… the second is through legal action… and the third is through arbitration,” the former ambassador said. Likewise, former Philippine National Police (PNP) General and now Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong lamented that his city has been “impacted indirectly by the ongoing issue of the West Philippine Sea.” “The only way we will be able to resolve the issue is through dialogue, constant dialogues, low-key dialogues. Besides, our only objective there is to allow our fishermen to go to that area and proceed with their livelihood. And second, probably a joint exploration on the oil. There was a study made by the US Geological Survey stating therein that there are about a billion barrels of oil and trillion natural gas in the West Philippine Sea,” Magalong said. Former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, for his part, said that it takes a “lot of skilled diplomacy to solve that, but one thing is undeniable - the livelihood of our fisherfolk is primary because this is survival for them.” Teodoro said that “multilateralism basically is really important in the sense that it prevents a stronger country, in theory, from bullying a smaller one. Now, having a bilateral approach would mean the more powerful one will prevail.” “So, the balance will be we continue to develop our capabilities in creating a credible deterrent against expansionism, but we continue to pursue those activities which can redound mutually to the benefit of our interests of both people, particularly economically,” Teodoro said. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

In a statement, Duterte said that while her office appreciates the support from certain individuals, it would be better if they would prioritize their families’ needs first or just donate to communities suffering from the effects of the tropical cyclone. “Subalit sa pinsalang dala ng bagyong 'Enteng', hinihikayat namin na kung may nais kayong i-donate, nawa’y ito’y ibigay na lamang sa mga kapwa nating kababayan na kasalukuyang lubos na naapektuhan ng pag-ulan at pagbaha. Malaking bagay ang anumang tulong upang maibsan ang kanilang pinagdadaanan at makabangon muli,” she said. (Due to the onslaught of Enteng, we encourage those who want to donate something to just give it to our countrymen who were greatly affected by the rains and floods. Any help to alleviate what they are going through and to help them get back on their feet would be greatly appreciated.) “Kasabay pa nito, sa kabila ng pagtaas ng presyo ng mga pagkain at iba pang pangunahing bilihin, nais rin naming ipabatid na higit na mahalaga ang unahin ninyo ang inyong mga sariling pangangailangan at ang kapakanan ng inyong pamilya,” she added. (At the same time, amid the rising price of food and other commodities, it is more important that you prioritize your own needs and the well-being of your family.) The OVP’s proposed P2.037-billion budget for next year is currently under scrutiny by Congress. At the Senate, Senator Risa Hontiveros had pointed out that a huge chunk of the OVP’s P1.909-billion budget for its operations is allotted for the delivery of socio-economic programs such as medical and burial assistance, disaster operations, food bags for certain families, and livelihood assistance. The lawmaker and Duterte had a heated exchange after the former said these programs are “very similar” with the existing programs of other line agencies of the government. Meanwhile, at the House of Representatives, the Committee on Appropriations deferred the deliberation s of the OVP’s 2025 budget amid Duterte’s refusal to answer how her office uses its budget. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

According to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) affirmed the wage order of the RTWPB, granting a P50 daily wage hike for private sector workers, which will be given in two tranches. The wage hike will increase the daily minimum wage in Caraga from P385 to P415 starting January 2, 2025, and from P415 to P435 upon the effectivity of the second tranche on May 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the RTWPB also approved a P1,000 increase for domestic workers (kasambahays) in the region, bringing their minimum wage to P6,000. “The wage order is expected to directly benefit 65,681 minimum wage earners in the region,” the DOLE said. “About 132,217 full-time wage and salary workers earning above the minimum wage may also indirectly benefit as a result of upward adjustments at the enterprise level arising from the correction of wage distortion,” it said. The DOLE also expects that at least 32,866 domestic workers will benefit from the increase, of which 7,939 were under live-in arrangements. In May, DOLE Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said some regional wage boards would begin the review of wage orders after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a study of the minimum wage rates in every region. Laguesma previously said the DOLE is expecting all RTWPBs across the country to finish their review before the end of the year.

    "article_body": "The 50 Filipino teachers who were in Maui, Hawaii under an exchange program are safe following the massive wildfires that hit the island, an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said Tuesday. “Meron tayong alam na singkwenta na guro na may J-1 visa doon sa Maui, pero nako-contact na sila. They are safe,” DFA Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega said in a Super Radyo dzBB interview. (We know of fifty teachers in Maui under J-1 visas, but we have contacted them. They are safe.) Last week, Dde Vega said at least 50 Filipino teachers in Maui were being located by the Philippine Consulate amid the wildfires that erupted in Lahaina town in Maui. These teachers have J-1 visas which are granted to foreigners in the work-and-study-based exchange and visitor programs of the United States. Three of them were based in Lahaina, but were not affected by the wildfires, according to the DFA official. Four Filipino-Americans were already confirmed dead by authorities due to the catastrophe. Recently identified was Rodolfo Rocutan , 76 years old, from Ilocos. Other fatalities were Conchita Sagudang and her son Danilo , who were both from Abra; and Alfredo Galinato who was a naturalized US citizen originally from Ilocos. Over 800 people are still missing following the Maui wildfires. — Giselle Ombay/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Monday said it issued show cause orders (SCOs) to 51 retail firms for selling basic necessities and prime commodities (BNPCs) priced higher than the previous month. The department said the firms were found to have sold BNPCs over 10% higher than the prices in the preceding month, and with inconsistent price tags, or totally absent tags. The stores were given 48 hours from receipt to submit a written explanation on the matter. This comes as the DTI’s Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) conducted inspections in the price and supply of BNPCs carried by 76 retail firms within Malabon, Pasig, Parañaque and Quezon City. The DTI said 70 firms were found to be compliant with the suggested retail price (SRP) bulletin released in August, reflecting a 92% compliance rate in the National Capital Region (NCR). There were six firms issued a letter of inquiry (LOI) for selling items prices higher than the SRP, with the stores given 72 hours to explain. Four have already submitted a written explanation. “We encourage sellers and manufacturers to comply with the SRP bulletin as such informs and protects consumers from deceptive or unconscionable transactions,” Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said in an emailed statement. Prices of consumer goods grew by 6.9% in September , driven by prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages which climbed by 7.4% during the month. Both the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) expect inflation to remain high in the remainder of the year, due to the weak peso and the damage caused by Typhoon Karding (international name: Noru). —NB, GMA News",

According to Marisol Abdurahman's report on \"24 Oras,\" authorities discovered meat and fish like lapu-lapu covered with sacks. \"Clear violation of food safety, it does not have Sanitary and Phytosanitary Import Clearances (SPSIC) so it's a clear violation of Food Safety Act,\" said Department of Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel De Mesa. The cold storage facilities were not immediately visible as they were hidden behind fake walls. However, authorities were led to their target by the foul smell of some of the products. \"Hinahanap namin saan naggagaling, hindi naman namin makita kasi sarado siya. E masangsang talaga so nung binuksan nila 'yon, may isang kahon na isda na nabubulok,\" Major Joel Pinawin, Field Station Chief, Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service of Port of Manila. In a separate storage facility, authorities also seized frozen peking duck, which are banned in the country. There were also frozen dim sum and vegetables inside the two-story storage building. \"Bacon, may mga pata ng baboy, dito sa ilalim mga beef ribs. So makikita din natin na basta nalang isinalansan,\" said De Mesa. A total of 10 storage facilities were discovered inside the warehouse. The Bureau of Customs said the frozen goods were imported from Hong Kong and China. The bureau added it would recommend a warrant of seizure of the warehouse. It is still unknown where the other items from the warehouse were brought, which according to the department may be harmful to health. \"Kung hindi natin tiyak tiyak ang kaligtasan hindi natin dapat ito ilabas sa merkado,\" said De Mesa.

    "article_body": "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Monday marked its 87th founding anniversary in a ceremony held at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. attended the celebration for the first time as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He was joined by AFP Chief-of-Staff Bartolome Bacarro, Department of Defense officer-in-charge Jose Faustino Jr., Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Sandro Marcos, and other government officials and foreign dignitaries. Marcos also led the conferment of awards on military officers, civilians, and organizations who had great contributions to the AFP. During his speech, Bacarro vowed to sustain the government’s gains in the country’s internal and external security including decreasing the communists' terrorist groups’ capability and the modernization of the AFP assets. “International security operations are of prime importance to ensure the safety and security of our citizens against spoilers of peace and lawless elements,” said Bacarro. “On this front, we can confidently state that we have achieved strategic victory and it is inching closer towards victory against terrorism. Our localized peace-building efforts with a multi-stakeholder and whole-of-nation approach also yielded positive results that encouraged enemies of the state to return to the fold of the law and build goodwill with communities,” he said. Bacarro also said the AFP has strengthened its external ties with the Philippines’ partner countries in the ASEAN, the Indo-Pacific Region, and other nations. “We also conducted training, military exchanges, and joint combined exercises. These opportunities allowed us to learn from our international counterparts, have our voice heard on the global stage, and conduct defense diplomacy purposely and rationally,” he said. Further, the military official thanked the President and Vice President Sara Duterte for their trust and support, saying they can count “on the same zeal and commitment from the AFP in ensuring the safety, the integrity and the security” in the country. “Soon, we will unveil a new campaign plan, a plan that will assist in setting the stage for the attainment of genuine unity, synergy, and peace for our country. As we look forward to the dawn of the new year, rest assured that we will remain hard at work operationally and strategically in sustaining our gains made these years,” he said. “We all witnessed the AFP accomplish an inordinate amount of good work, thus this has been an uncommonly good year for the AFP,” he added. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

PTFoMS executive director Paul Gutierrez said Remulla issued Administrative Order (AO) 1 on April 15, approving the agency’s request to form an SIT. “We are very thankful for the swift and immediate action of Secretary Remulla creating SIT Dizon. This again shows that the government is unrelenting in pursuing justice for all victims of heinous crimes, especially the members of the press, regardless of when the crime took place,” Gutierrez said in a press statement. Malolos City Prosecutor Aldrin Evangelista, who handled the 2009 Ampatuan Massacre, will lead the investigating task force. According to the PTFoMS, three suspects surfaced during an investigation conducted by an initial SITG and the Philippine National Police (PNP) in 2019 — Sotero ‘Jun’ Jacolbe, Dante Encarnacion Tabusares, aka, ‘Bong Encarnacion,’ and Junell Jane Andagkit Poten, aka, ‘Junell Gerozaga.’ Jacolbe and Encarnacion, however, were recently allowed to post bail by separate Davao courts. “The creation of the SIT is one of the important measures the PTFoMS has adopted to bolster this case,” Gutierrez said. “We shall be announcing the other measures we have prepared as soon as they are finalized. But our message remains simple and clear: Perpetrators of violent crimes against the media would face the full force of the law. It may take some time but justice would prevail in the end,” he said. A radio commentator of Brigada News, Dizon was fatally shot by motorcycle-riding suspects on the evening of July 10, 2019. Investigation showed he might have been targeted due to his criticism of Encarnacion and the KAPA Ministry that was ordered closed by the government in 2019 for allegedly serving as a front for a financial scam. Encarnacion was the leader of KAPA in North Cotabato at the time. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2022-08-25T12:20:00",
    "article_body": "The continuation of the Department of Transportation's (DOTr) program to provide free rides to commuters and incentivize public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and operators who participated in the initiative did not receive an allocation in the agency's 2023 budget. During the House Committee on Transportation’s hearing on Thursday, Transportation Undersecretary for Road Transport and Infrastructure Mark Steven Pastor said the DOTr requested P12 billion for the service contracting program for 2023. “However, hindi naisama sa [it was not included in the] National Expenditure Program (NEP),” Pastor said. Under the NEP, the DOTr has a proposed budget of P171.1 billion for next year, up 120.4% from P75.8 billion in 2022. Sought for clarification, Budget Undersecretary for Media Affairs, Community Relations, and Internal Audit Goddes Libiran told GMA News Online that the service contracting program is a non-recurring or one-time expenditure item. “It is not a regular program. Hence, similar to previous years, no funds were allocated for it under the 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP),” Libiran said. The service contracting or “Libreng Sakay” program of the DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was launched in late 2020 under Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act to help commuters and those in the public transport sector affected by the pandemic. Under the service contracting program, PUV operators and drivers who participated in the government’s free ridership program will receive a one-time payout and weekly payments based on the number of kilometers traveled per week, whether they have passengers or not. The DOTr has since continued the implementation of the program in 2021 and 2022. “We are apealing na mapondohan ang service contracting upang next year ay may pondo po ang Libreng Sakay,” Pastor told the House panel. (We are appealing that the service contracting program be funded so that next year the Libreng Sakay program can continue.) ACT-Teachers party-list Representative France Castro expressed support for DOTr's appeal. “Allow us to note further that the inclusion of the SCP in the FY 2022 General Appropriation Act (GAA) is congress-introduced. Hence, we will defer to the wisdom of our honorable lawmakers the decision on whether or not to allot appropriations for the said program,” Libiran said. “We shall likewise defer to the direction of the Department of Finance (DOF) as to policies concerning the sustainability and continuation of programs related to financial assistance,” the Budget official said. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has approved the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and the Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) amounting to P1.4 billion , which will cover the additional funds needed for the extended Libreng Sakay program from September 1 until December 31, 2022. “It is important to note that the SCP (service contracting program) was originally implemented by the DOTr at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to provide assistance to the road transport sector badly hit by the pandemic. This year, it was intended to mitigate the impact of the fuel surge. We expect oil prices to stabilize next year,” Libiran said. Libiran was the former assistant secretary for Communications and Commuter Affairs of the DOTr during the previous administration. —KBK/BM, GMA News",

    "article_body": "The House of Representatives on Monday approved on third and final reading a bill establishing a Virology and Vaccines Institute of the Philippines (VVIP), one of one of the priority measures of the Marcos administration amid the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. This developed after the measure numbered House Bill 6452 gathered 216 yes votes, zero no votes and zero abstention during Monday’s plenary session. House Bill 6452 provides that the VVIP, which will be an attached agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), will serve as as the premier research and development institute in the field of virology, encompassing all kinds of viruses and viral diseases in plants, animals and humans. Likewise, the measure states that the VVIP will also be a venue for scientists, research institutes and other organizations in the Philippines and abroad, to work collaboratively to study viruses of agricultural, industrial, clinical and environmental importance. In addition, the bill states that the VVIP will focus on the following key science and technology applications: The same bill also allows the VVIP to procure specialized materials, equipment, and services to be used in its operation and administration, in the most expeditious manner, as well as adopt the most suitable or appropriate method of procurement that it deems fit based on its identified needs and requirements depending on the existing conditions and requirements that justify the use of a particular alternative modality provided for by the Government Procurement Reform Act and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations. Albay Representative Joey Salceda of Albay, one of the authors of the measure, earlier said he envisions the VVIP as the Philippines’ version of the Serum Institute of India known for manufacturing effective vaccines, among others. “India continues to be one of the world’s largest manufacturers of COVID vaccines even if it did not originate them, because they have a serum institute. Vietnam solved ASF (African Swine Flu) first because their serum institute invented a vaccine early on,” Salceda said. “The vaccine institute is not merely a health institute. The applications for virology are immense and broad. Food security, forest management, and the development of a strong pharmaceutical sector all benefit from a strong grasp of viruses,” he added. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

The Senate Special Committee on Philippine Maritime and Admiralty Zones, headed by Senator Francis Tolentino, discussed the matter further with concerned officials but in a closed session. FOBs are smaller than a main naval base and naval operating base, as defined in the proposed measure. These will serve as an outpost in strategic locations near the West Philippine Sea and the Philippine Rise. These are naval and military facilities that can immediately carry out the Navy's mandate in the far-flung areas and as a potential site for future upgrade and expansion. Under the bill, these 12 sites are determined as priority locations for FOBs:",

    "article_body": "Commuters and motorists will have to brace for heavier traffic congestion until the “Ber” months as repairs are scheduled in some parts of EDSA by the end of March. In Joseph Morong’s Tuesday report on “24 Oras,” portions of EDSA will undergo rehaul or extensive road repair starting with the EDSA Busway northbound lane from Balintawak to Monumento. Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Manuel Bonoan said the EDSA Busway will be replaced with new and stronger pavement. For the meantime or until the repair work is completed, the EDSA buses will use the adjacent lane while the remaining lanes are allotted for private vehicles. “Tatanggalin namin yung mga barriers nila (the barriers will be removed). The buses will have to share with the open lanes for the time being they will just have to be limited to the adjacent lanes,” Bonoan said. Meanwhile, 15 segments will be repaired in the EDSA southbound lane. After the EDSA Busway repair, the repair work will be done on the remaining lanes until the outer lane. The DPWH said it will also widen EDSA’s drainage system. “These were installed a long time ago so maliliit na yan (they are small). That’s the reason why hindi na kwan sa run off (it's not that efficient),” Bonoan said. According to the DPWH, the EDSA rehaul will take about one year until the ‘Ber’ months when traffic is usually heavier. Some commuters said it is more convenient if the EDSA Busway has its own lane for faster travel. \"Ber\" months refer to September, October, November, and December. — Mariel Celine Serquiña/BAP, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Monday explained why it took time for him to fulfill his campaign promise of P20 per kilo of rice. In his speech during One Cebu rally, Marcos said the government needs to provide assistance first to the local farmers, including the provision of machinery. ''Iyan po ay nakamit na natin. Hindi po naabot kaagad dahil ito po ay kailangan ayusin po natin ang ating pagtulong sa ating mga magsasaka. Kailangan bigyan natin sila ng mga makinarya,'' Marcos said. (We've attained this. We didn't achieve it immediately because we need to fix our assistance to farmers. We need to give them machinery.) ''Kailangan magtayo tayo ng mga processing center. Iyan kaya’t sinimulan po namin ito pag-upo. Dahan-dahan, dumadami na. Kaya’t kaya na naming gawin ito. Pinalitan pa natin ang batas ng NFA, halimbawa, at marami pa po tayong gagawin,'' he added. (We need to establish processing centers. That's what we started when we assumed office. It started to grow. We can do this now. We will do more.) Marcos, who served as Agriculture chief at the start of his presidency, expressed belief that the country's agricultural sector is stronger now. ''Ngunit ngayon matibay-tibay na ang agricultural sector natin. Kaya’t pinropose ko po sa lahat ng mga gobernador ng Visayas na sabi ko, 'Bakit ‘di natin subukan itong P20 per kilo dito sa inyo?''' Marcos said. (Our agriculture sector is stronger now, that's why we proposed to the governors of Visayas for us to try selling the P20 per kilo of rice in the region.) Marcos had since been hopeful about his campaign promise to reduce the price of rice to as low as P20 per kilo. He had said the aspiration hinges on fixing the value chain, or the series of stages involved in producing a product or service that is sold to consumers, with each stage adding to the value of the product or service. The Department of Agriculture has decided to temporarily halt the sale of P20 per kilo rice for 10 days in deference to the ayuda ban amid the election season. Earlier, the Commission on Elections announced that the distribution of ayuda would be banned from May 2 to May 12, or 10 days leading to the midterm elections. —LDF, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2024-08-01T12:59:00",
    "article_body": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) is “doubly confident” that Timor-Leste will affirm its earlier ruling granting the extradition request of the Philippines for former Negros Oriental Representative Arnolfo “Arnie” Teves Jr. “There’s little that they can argue in addition to what they’ve already argued before. So that’s why we are doubly confident na magkaroon ulit tayo ng [that there will be a] confirmation of the decision that was first rendered,” Justice spokesperson Mico Clavano said in an ambush interview. In June, the Department of Justice announced that Timor-Leste granted the extradition of Teves. The Teves camp filed their motion for reconsideration on the ruling on July 26, Friday before the Court of Appeals of Timor-Leste. According to Clavano, Teves’ camp had argued against the merits of the case. “This one, they’re questioning yung ano na talaga, kung ano yung naging ruling nung Court of Appeals regarding the extradition request of the Philippines, which we have won,” Clavano said. “Makapal ‘yung sinubmit nila pero the prosecutor general informed us that they are already willing and able to submit their comment na rin on the motion for reconsideration,\" he added. (The document they submitted was thick but the prosecutor general informed us that they are already willing and able to submit their comment on the motion for reconsideration.) He said that Teves’ camp only rehashed their arguments in the MR. “It seems like a rehash of all their arguments to begin with. Political persecution, the fact that we have the death penalty here and all these other arguments which have already been ruled upon before,” he said. According to Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, the legal counsel of Teves, the Prosecutor-General of Timor-Leste has 30 days to respond to the appeal. He said that Teves was “in high spirits.” The expelled lawmaker was arrested in Timor-Leste in March based on the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) red notice issued against him in February. A red notice is a request for law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest a person pending his extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. The notice stemmed from the multiple murder charges filed against Teves for the killing of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo and nine others in March 2023. Teves has repeatedly denied any involvement in the Degamo killing. READ: TIMELINE: Degamo killing and murder raps vs. Arnie Teves Teves was released from house arrest in June. Aside from the murder of Degamo, Teves and others have also been charged with the deaths of three individuals in Negros Oriental in 2019. Teves and 12 others have also been designated as terrorists by the Anti-Terrorism Council, citing several alleged killings and harassment in Negros Oriental. He was expelled by the House of Representatives in August last year for disorderly conduct and continued absence despite an expired travel authority. — RSJ/RF, GMA Integrated News",

(After a long time of waiting and efforts by the government, the remains of OFW Dafnie Nacalaban arrived tonight and will be brought to her family in the province to spend their last moments together.) Nacalaban, who was employed as a household service worker in Kuwait since December 2019, was reported missing by her second employer in October 2024. Her body was later discovered in an advanced state of decomposition in the residence of a Kuwaiti individual, two months after her employer's report. Information received by the Office of Migrant Affairs from the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait showed that the victim's body was found after a sibling of the suspect made a report to the police. There have been several deaths of OFWs in Kuwait, which led to a deployment ban by the Philippine government. But this was lifted by the Department of Labor and Employment in 2020 after the Kuwaiti government conceded to the conditions set by the Philippines during a board meeting. However, with the deaths of Nacalaban and fellow OFW Jenny Alvarado, the Department of Migrant Workers earlier said that it is mulling to impose again a deployment ban to Kuwait. —Vince Angelo Ferreras/LDF, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Philippines was likely to hit the low end of its 6% to 7% economic growth target this year on the back of an improvement in employment and the continuous growth of manufacturing, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said. According to NEDA Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon, the latest economic indicators showed that the country’s economic growth target set by the inter-agency Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) could still be hit. “For the year, ang expectation namin (our expectation) is we will hit the low end of the target, if not close to it. So iyong (the) low end of the target is 6%, so either a 6(%) or ‘yon nga, very close to that 6%,” she said in a weekend news forum. Edillon cited the country’s employment data and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the projection, as she said the agency was “hopeful about 2023.” The number of jobless Filipinos aged 15 and above fell to 2.09 million in October , an improvement from the 2.26 million in September. This translated to an unemployment rate of 4.2%, while the employment rate stood at 95.8%, and the underemployment rate was 11.7%. Meanwhile, the manufacturing output, measured by the volume of production index (VoPI), grew by 1.7% in October , slower than the 9.9% growth in the previous month, and the 6.7% increase in the previous year. “Ang kailangan na lang pong maibalik natin talaga iyong international tourism. Domestic tourism, nag-work po iyon ating holiday economics… So iyon po ‘yung kailangan pa nating ibalik,” Edillon said. (What we need to resume is international tourism. Domestic tourism worked with our holiday economics, so that is what we need to resume.) “And then, nakita rin namin with respect to government spending, so iyong second quarter was again… Kasi nakita namin may ano din ito, may parang learning curve no, marami kasing mga bago sa gobyerno. Nakita naman natin na third quarter, nakapag-catch up din, so we are actually hopeful for the rest of the year, but especially going forward,” she added. (And then what we saw concerning government spending in the second quarter was again, we saw that there was a learning curve since there were a lot of new ones in the government.

Magkakaroon tayo ng intervention [in] the mental health system because you know the stress of performing a job especially in combat areas,\" he said. (The Armed Forces will continue to prioritize the healthcare system for our soldiers. We will have an intervention in the mental health system because you know the stress of performing a job, especially in combat areas.) \"And at the same time, we will also sustain the comprehensive social benefit program for the families of our soldiers. Actually, there are already existing systems and processes that are being followed to make sure that the benefits of our soldiers and their dependents are properly taken care of.\" The call for better mental health services for soldiers came after former soldier Winston Ragos was shot dead by a Quezon City police officer in April 2020. He was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. According to AFP General Hospital neuropsychiatric service chief, Major Christine de Jesus, there are only 15 psychologists and two psychiatrists working in the Philippine Army as of 2020. Aguilar said the AFP was also willing to help in the construction of hospitals for veterans in Visayas and Mindanao. He said the AFP was ready to provide technical support and engineering construction to speed up the construction of these hospitals. — VBL, GMA News",

The leaders of the ASEAN member-states did the traditional handshake during the ceremony. Marcos will be in Indonesia until Thursday to attend the ASEAN main events as well as other related summits. He arrived in Jakarta on Monday evening. The 43rd ASEAN Summit will conclude on September 7 with a handover ceremony of the ASEAN chairmanship from Indonesia to Laos. Before he left the Philippines, Marcos said he would continue to promote Philippine interests during the summit and other related summits. Marcos is expected to attend at least 13 leader-level engagements during the summit, including the 43rd ASEAN Summit Plenary Session, the Opening Ceremony of the ASEAN Indo-Pacific Forum, and the 43rd ASEAN Summit Retreat Session. Marcos will also attend the 26th ASEAN-China Summit, the 24th ASEAN-Republic of Korea Summit, the 26th ASEAN-Japan Summit, the 26th ASEAN Plus Three Summit, the ASEAN-US Summit, and the ASEAN-Canada Summit.

    "date_published": "2023-05-19T16:44:00",
    "article_body": "Health experts on Friday encouraged Filipinas to get early screening against cervical cancer in order to get early diagnosis and treatment that can help prevent this disease. Gynecologic oncologist Dr. Cecilia Llave emphasized the importance of early screening, despite not showing any signs and symptoms of cervical cancer. “It is very important that you are screened even if wala kang signs and symptoms and in order to save women’s lives, I think number one is healthy living then vaccination. Early screening kahit wala pang nararamdaman and early diagnosis and treatment can save lives of our women,” Llave said at the Department of Health (DOH) Kapihan forum. “The nice thing about cervical cancer [is that it] is treatable when diagnosed early. It is very preventable so have yourself screened now,” she added. Llave said among the cervical cancer risk factors are early sexual contact, low resistance, having many children, and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases. She described cervical cancer as a “very quiet disease” and “silent killer” as many women do not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. However, the late signs and symptoms of the disease include bleeding especially after coitus, difficulty of urination, difficulty of defecation, hypogastric, and low back pains. The World Health Organization (WHO) mandates screening every three to five years even without signs and symptoms, according to Llave. Llave said they recommended women to get screened from ages 25 to 65. “Kahit walang nararamdaman, magpa-screen na at 25 especially when sexually active. [Also] you don’t need sexual penetration in order to get the disease,” she advised. (Even if you don't have signs and symptoms, get screened at age 25 especially when you are sexually active. And also you don't need sexual penetration in order to get the disease.) Meanwhile, Dr. Jan Llevado, DOH Cancer Control and Mental Health Division division chief, advised women to get the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), saying that it is safe and effective to prevent cervical cancer. “Kung ang mga kababaihan natin pumupunta sa isang health center for other services, isama ninyo na yung pagtanong sa cervical cancer screening and even to have clinical breast examination kasi dapat talaga very important na maaga natin madetect itong mga sakit na ito,” Llevado said. (If our women go to a health center for other services, you might also ask about cervical cancer screening and even clinical breast examination because it is very important that we detect these diseases early.) “Do not be afraid of vaccination kasi it has been there for many years already, it has been tested not just HPV vaccination but even COVID lahat tayo nagpabakuna. Huwag po kayong matakot,” she added. (Do not be afraid of vaccination because it has been there for many years already, it has been tested not just for HPV vaccination but even COVID, we have all been vaccinated. Do not be afraid.) The month of May has been declared Cervical Cancer Prevention Awareness Month in the Philippines. According to Guard Against HPV, a 2019 study by the HPV Information Centre showed that 7,190 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed annually in the Philippines. In 2019, the DOH assured the public that the HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing cervical cancer. — LA, GMA Integrated News",

The President also said in February last year that he would not cooperate with the ICC investigation. He also said that he considers the ICC a threat to Philippine sovereignty. It was Duterte who pulled the Philippines out of the Hague-based ICC's Rome Statute in 2018, with the withdrawal taking effect in 2019, after the tribunal began a preliminary probe into his administration's drug war.

    "article_body": "Two teachers' groups have called on the Department of Education (DepEd) to suspend and review the implementation of the \"Catch-up Fridays,\" which sets aside a day in the school week to focus on improving Filipino learners' reading skills and enhancing their academic performance. More than a month since its implementation in all basic education public schools nationwide, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) said teachers are the ones who bear the brunt of additional workload in preparation and implementation of the Catch-up Fridays. \"Due to the lack or insufficiency of books or materials, teachers are forced to spend on photocopying reading materials,\" the group said. \"Instead of regular classes during this time and preparing for upcoming exams, schools were transformed into Reading Hubs every Friday, with teachers solely focused on reading activities. Regular classes were suspended,\" ACT said. ACT said DepEd's intervention programs to address learning crisis should be tailored to every individual needs of students. \"Therefore, Catch-Up Fridays should be halted, and consultations should precede any further action,\" it added. Meanwhile, Teachers' Dignity Coalition (TDC) chairperson Benjo Basas said that DepEd should not hasten the implementation of the program as it may bring more problems to the education sector, rather than solving the learning losses among learners. Even as he acknowledged that such intervention is necessary, Basas admitted that the Catch-up Fridays have brought more stress to some teachers due to the problems in schedule and the financial burden it causes. \"Sa tingin natin mga kapatid, mukhang kailangan nating i-review itong Catch-up Fridays. Ang sinasabi natin sa TDC, nagkakaisa tayo sa consensus, hindi natin kailangan itong Catch-up Fridays, with due respect sa ating DepEd, in particular Curriculum and Teaching Strand,\" he said. (We think that Catch-up Fridays needs to be reviewed. We have a consensus in TDC; we believe that we don't need this Catch-up Fridays, with due respect to our DepEd, in particular the Curriculum and Teaching Strand.) In response, DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa stressed that the department does not require students to spend money for their participation in Catch-up Fridays. ''Wala pong nire-require ang kagawaran na dagdag expenses sa ating learners sa kanilang mga magulang o pagbili ng mga booklet,'' Poa said in Marisol Abdurahman's report on ''24 Oras Weekend'' on Saturday. (The department does not impose additional expenses on the parents of our learners or require them to buy booklets.) Poa also said the DepEd was open to suggestions on how to improve the program. It was on January 12, 2024 when DepEd started designating all Fridays throughout the current school year as a \"catch-up\" day to enhance the academic performance of students in the K to 12 Basic Education Program, considering their low proficiency levels in reading, based on national and international large-scale assessments. The DepEd said that during the first half of the catch-up day, the focus will be on the operationalizing of the National Reading Program, while the second half will center on fostering values, health, and peace education. There will also be a Homeroom Guidance Program every Friday. Last week, DepEd said that it does not authorize the selling of booklets or workbooks for Catch-up Fridays, adding that school activities must not involve out-of-pocket costs. — VDV/VBL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Lawmakers belonging to the Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives on Monday filed a resolution seeking a congressional inquiry into the use of stock footage in the recently launched \"Love the Philippines\" tourism campaign. In their proposed House Resolution 1115, House Deputy Minority Leader France Castro of ACT Teachers party-list, House Assistant Minority Leader Arlene Brosas of Gabriela party-list, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel said an inquiry was in order after the Department of Tourism terminated its contract with the advertising agency DDB Philippines. “While the DOT stressed that no public funds have been paid for the video, Congress should investigate the matter and if there are lapses in appropriate laws, rules, and regulations, especially since billions of public funds and resources are allotted for such rebranding,\" the proposed resolution read. \"Congress is duty-bound to ensure that public funds are used efficiently and effectively and that government agencies are held accountable for their actions,” it added. Under the DOT's appropriations for 2023, P1.27 billion DOT has been set aside for its branding campaign program. The amount accounts for 37.3% of the budget of the DOT-Office of the Secretary. The said budget is also 3.1 times higher than the previous year’s budget worth P309.575 million. The proposed resolution asked that the House \"through its Committee on Tourism and Committee on Good Government and Public Accountability, investigate, in aid of legislation, the controversy on the Branding Campaign Program of the Department of Tourism and the video promoting Philippine tourism that uses foreign stock footage.\" DDB Philippines has apologized for the use of non-original content and called it an unfortunate oversight. The DOT still decided to terminate its contract. President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr. said on Friday that Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco still had his trust and confidence . “I spoke to her... Nakita ko naman mabilis ang galaw niya (I saw that she was decisive in addressing the issue.) The “Love the Philippines” campaign replaced the “It’s More Fun in the Philippines” slogan, which has been the country’s tourism slogan since 2012. Frasco has also said that the DOT will stick with the “Love the Philippines” campaign despite the stock video fiasco. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Wednesday told the United Nations Human Rights Council of the Philippines' rejection of the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) reopening of its inquiry on the killings blamed on the previous administration's war on drugs. In his speech during the 52nd session of the Human Rights Council, Remulla said \"unjustified external interference\" rarely served the cause of human rights. “The Philippines has a fully functioning justice system under the complementarity test. The ICC, therefore, has no jurisdiction over Filipino citizens whatsoever,” Remulla said told the UN's human rights body. “Let us heed the lessons of the past. Unjustified external interference has very rarely if at all, served the cause of human rights,” he added. Remulla said the Philippines respected freedom of expression \"and there are hundreds of mainstream media outfits and actors and thousands of social media practitioners.\" \"Yet, we draw the line as any sovereign state must when an international institution overreaches and departs from the boundaries of its creation,\" Remulla said. \"In this context, the Philippine government rejects the ICC’s decision to resume investigations over alleged crimes committed during the anti-illegal drug campaign,\" he added. The Philippines withdrew from the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, in March 2019. In January, the ICC authorized the reopening of an inquiry into the drug war of former President Rodrigo Duterte, a move that was not welcomed by Philippine authorities and described by Remulla as an “irritant.” The government has said that intended to appeal the resumption of the inquiry before the ICC Appeals Chamber. According to Remulla, the government believes that international human rights organizations must focus on enabling states to fulfill their obligations. \"The Philippines strongly believes that our international human rights architecture must focus more on capacitating states to effectively fulfill their obligations as duty bearers. This is a more meaningful and effective tool in human rights protection,\" he said. Remulla also said there is no culture of impunity in the Philippines. “Let me assure this council and partners and civil society and reiterate, there is no culture of impunity in the Philippines. We are doubling our efforts to ensure that individuals who breach the bounds of the law, state actors included,” Remulla said. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Researchers from the University of the Philippines Manila have developed a gout medication made of ulasimang bato, also known as pansit-pansitan. The drug, which comes in tablet form, has been shown to reduce uric acid levels in patients with gout, which is a common form of arthritis. ''Their clinical trials demonstrated a progressive reduction in uric acid levels among participants, with a 40% decrease observed by Day 14. This reduction continued, reaching up to 63% by Day 28 and up to 78% by Day 49,'' UP Manila said in an article posted on its website. ''Notably, no adverse effects were reported, in contrast to conventional gout treatments that may pose risks to kidney and liver health.'' The DOST's Philippine Council for Health Research and Development said in a separate article that the researchers found that the ideal dosage should be set at 80 mg/kg/day at first, and then lowered to 40 mg/kg/day after two weeks. Jade Rodriguez, one of the research proponents from the UP Manila Institute of Herbal Medicine of the National Institutes of Health, said the findings showed that ulasimang bato (Peperomia pellucida) ''has powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperuricemia properties.'' ''It could be a safer, more natural way for Filipinos to manage gout without the risks linked to synthetic drugs,” he added. Gout affects some 1.6 million Filipinos, according to the Philippine Rheumatology Association. Its symptoms include ''sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe,'' the Mayo Clinic said. According to UP Manila, efforts are underway to make the pansit-pansitan tablet accessible to the public. ''The university’s Technology Transfer and Business Development Office (TTBDO) is looking for partners to help bring this herbal medicine to market,'' it said. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The number of registered mobile phone subscriber identification modules (SIMs) is now at over 104 million, days before the expiration of the extended SIM registration deadline on July 25, 2023. Data from the National Telecommunications Commission’s SIM registration update showed that a total of 104,076,843 SIMs had been registered as of July 19, 2023. This accounts for 61.94% of the total 168,016,400 subscriber base. Broken down, the 104.076 million registered SIMs are composed of 49.2 million Smart subscribers, accounting for 74.20% of the company’s total 66.304 million subscriber base. Globe followed with 47.47 million registered SIMs or 54.73% of its 86.746 million total subscribers. DITO Telecommunity’s registered subscribers, meanwhile, reached 7.4 million or 49.54% of its 14.964 million total customers. The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) stood firm on the deadline, saying there will be no more extension and those with unregistered SIMs will immediately lose connection at 12:01 a.m. on July 26. Despite the deactivation of unregistered SIMs a day after the deadline, the DICT said a five-day grace period for reactivation of the disconnected SIMs will be allowed. In April, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. approved a 90-day extension of the SIM registration period until July 25 from the original deadline of April 26. The DICT earlier said it will gradually deactivate some SIM services, such as access to social media accounts and the ability to make outgoing calls, as the 90-day additional registration period moves forward. The DICT was also looking to register 70% of the total subscriber base. The implementing rules and regulations of the SIM Card Registration Act took effect on December 27, 2022, after the measure was signed into law by Marcos in October last year. The SIM Registration Act seeks to end crimes using the platform, including text and online scams, by regulating the sale and use of SIMs through mandating registration to end-users. The law mandates all telcos to submit a verified list of their authorized dealers and agents nationwide to the NTC and an updated list of the same every quarter of each year. —VAL, GMA Integrated News",

In a press briefing, PNP spokesperson Colonel Jean Fajardo said the police organization will not lower its guard especially after an encounter between members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and NPA in Batangas. “Wala po tayong irerekomenda so far para magkaroon ng ceasefire for this holiday season at kamakailan lang dito sa Batangas ay nagkaroon ng engkwentro between the members of NPA at ‘yung ating mga kasamahan sa AFP at merong namatay at nasugatan sa hanay ng ating government forces,” she said. (We will not recommend a ceasefire for this holiday season especially after the encounter in Batangas between the NPA and AFP where members of government forces were killed and injured.) One soldier was killed while three others were hurt in the encounter. Fajardo said the PNP is also on alert for the CPP-NPA’s anniversary on December 26. “Kasama ito sa pinaghahandaan natin, we will not lower our guards, alam natin na magkakaroon at magse-celebrate sila ng anniversary nitong December 26,” she said. (We are also preparing, we will not lower our guards, we know they will celebrate their anniversary on December 26.) She further said additional personnel have been deployed to police stations in far-flung provinces, especially in areas vulnerable to NPA attacks. “Katuwang ang AFP to make sure na hindi tayo malulusutan ng mga banta sa seguridad including ‘yung police stations at detachments,” she said. (We are working with AFP to make sure that police stations and detachments are ready to face any security threats.) Fajardo said because of the encounter, the PNP intensified its border control and checkpoint operations. Last year, the AFP did not declare a ceasefire with the CPP-NPA “because of leadership vacuum within the CPP after the neutralization of many of its top leaders.” But last month, the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines have agreed to resume the stalled peace negotiations after their representatives signed a joint statement for \"a principled and peaceful resolution to the armed conflict.\" \"The parties agree to a principled and peaceful resolution of the armed conflict. Resolving the roots of the armed conflict and ending the armed struggle shall pave the way for the transformation of the CPP-NPA-NDFP,\" they said in a joint statement. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

Under the 4Ps AlkanSSSya Program, 4Ps beneficiaries will be given access to low-cost social insurance covering income loss and sickness, among others, with the monthly premium shouldered by the beneficiaries. The program was implemented under a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the DSWD and SSS in July 2024. The MOA also provides the creation of a contribution subsidy table, which is based on an actuarial study conducted by the SSS and the beneficiaries' actual ability to pay the P570 minimum monthly amount. “Sa AlkanSSSya Program ay tinuturuan natin yung ating mga beneficiaries na makapag-ipon, mag-impok at maghulog doon sa kanilang SSS kasi ito ay social insurance para makatulong sa kanila kung sakaling may magka-sakit, sa panganganak, burial assistance, at iba pa,” Marie Grace Ponce, 4Ps Social Marketing Division chief, said Wednesday in the agency’s online program. (In the AlkanSSSya Program, we teach our beneficiaries to save and contribute to their SSS because this is their social insurance that could help them in case of illness, childbirth, burial assistance, and so on.) Ponce added the program aims to help 4Ps beneficiaries sustain themselves and help them from poverty.

    "article_body": "Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines remain to be an effective tool to protect people against the recently detected Omicron subvariant FE.1, Health Secretary Ted Herbosa said Wednesday. During the rollout of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccination in the Philippines , the newly appointed chief of the Department of Health (DOH) was asked if the bivalent jabs are also effective against the FE.1, which is a sublineage of the Omicron XBB subvariant. “Yes. Generally, because this is still Omicron and nilagay na ‘yung Omicron doon sa bivalent vaccine, meron nang cross immunity ‘yan kasi ‘yung mga antigens pareho lang even if it’s a different subvariant. Hindi mahihinto ‘yan,” Herbosa said. (Yes. Generally, because this FE.1 is still Omicron, and the Omicron has been put in the bivalent vaccine. There is already cross immunity because the antigens are the same even if it's a different subvariant. It won't stop.) The first case of FE.1 or XBB.1.18.1.1 was found in the genome sequencing conducted on May 29 to June 12, 2023, based on DOH’s latest COVID-19 biosurveillance report. The DOH said FE.1 was added to the list of variants under monitoring by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on June 1, 2023, and was initially flagged “for its increasing global prevalence,” being detected in 35 countries so far. The agency, however, stressed that currently available evidence for the subvariant does not suggest any differences in disease severity and/or clinical manifestations compared to the original Omicron variant. While admitting that he is yet to familiarize with the characteristics of the FE.1, Herbosa said it may also exhibit the same symptoms as those with other Omicron subvariants. “If you have upper respiratory symptoms [like] sipon, sore throat, ubo, ‘yan ang most common. Occasionally, kagaya sa Arcturus, meron sore eyes. Itong FE.1 I don’t know if ‘yun o pareho lang. Ma-identify dapat ng genetic studies,” he added. (If you have upper respiratory symptoms like cold, sore throat, and cough, those are the most common symptoms. Occasionally, like Arcturus, there could be sore eyes. I don't know if it's the same with FE.1. It should be identified by genetic studies.) Infectious diseases expert Dr. Rontgene Solante said Tuesday that FE.1 may cause severe forms of COVID-19 infections among those most vulnerable to the virus, like the elderly population. He, however, stressed that this should not be a cause for concern among Filipinos as the hospitals in the country are well managed. He also reminded the vulnerable population to keep wearing face masks and update their vaccination with booster shots to keep themselves protected against FE.1. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Tuesday expressed his intention to deepen ties with the United Arab Emirates as many Filipinos are working there. Marcos made this assertion during the courtesy call of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the UAE at the Malacañang Palace. He also thanked the UAE government for its aid and kindness to the Philippines especially during times of crisis. ''We owe you many expressions of gratitude for all the assistance and the kindness that UAE has extended to the Philippines and the Filipinos. And I hope that we are able to reciprocate somehow because we are very grateful for the assistance that you have done in terms of our, when there are crisis in the Philippines and then, especially to our Filipino nationals who are working in the Emirates,'' Marcos said. There are an estimated 700,000 Filipinos living and working in the Middle Eastern country, with around 450,000 residing in Dubai. ''So, I hope we'll be able to extend that relationship further and make it deeper,'' the President added. In response, Zayed Al Nahyan said he was honored to be back in the Philippines and that UAE is looking forward to having a ''better'' relationship with the country when it comes to trade. ''Our relationship is growing, but not enough. We could do much better. It could be much better because I think we have an interest to further enhance it. But also the Philippines has shown that it’s been welcoming investors, we would like to do more trade, we are on the path to finalize and sit down with the Philippines,'' he said. ''And finally, I would say Sir when the Emiratis... when they come to the Philippines they never feel leaving UAE. You really make them feel at home,'' he added. The Philippines and the UAE established diplomatic relations on August 19, 1974. The UAE and the Philippines are key partners in peace efforts, development, combating climate change, among other fields. The Emirates also gives considerable attention to assisting the development programs of the Philippine government, especially those associated with the peace process. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Amid the rising prices of onions in select markets, the Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday said it is studying all options, including possibly importing the commodity, to lower its cost. Interviewed on GMA Integrated News’ Unang Balita, DA Assistant Secretary Kristine Evangelista said they are coordinating with onion farmers to determine how they could lower the farmgate price, which currently stands at P100 to P120 per kilo. “Medyo mataas talaga ang ating farmgate price ngayon. Tinitignan natin kung paano, kung pwede talagang i-peg na lang sana sa P100 [per kilo] ang farmgate kung saan nakabawi na ating mga magsasaka, may margins na sila,” she said. (Onion’s farmgate price is really quite high now. We are looking at how or if we could peg the farmgate price at P100 per kilo, where our farmers already have their margins.) She said the DA also has to monitor the inflow and outflow of onion stocks in cold storage facilities, and check ports and markets to determine if there are smuggled onions being sold. “Sa ngayon, wala naman tayong nakikitang imported na mga sibuyas. Pero all the angles are being looked into para we are working on bringing down the price of onions para sa ating consumers,” Evangelista said. (Right now, we don't see any imported onions. But all the angles are being looked into, so we are working on bringing down the price of onions for our consumers.) According to the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) on Saturday, the supply of red onions in the country is enough to last until November, while that of white onions can last until September. The Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG) on Sunday called on the government to import white onions by July to avert a possible shortage and price increases. As for red onions, the group said the importation could be done at a later time. Evangelista said the DA will consider importing the commodity for price stability purposes. She, however, did not provide an estimated date as to when this will take place. “Siyempre, kailangan nating ma-maintain ang supply. At the same time, we will check ‘yung supply, nakakarating mismo sa palengke. ‘Pag ito ay sapat, ang presyo natin ay magiging stable,” she said. (We need to be able to maintain the supply. At the same time, we will check if the supply reaches the market itself. If this is enough, our price will be stable.) —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is tracking all the vessels around the Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal at the time a foreign vessel rammed a Filipino fishing boat and killed three fishermen on board. According to Speaker Martin Romualdez, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. has assured that the PCG has \"deployed every resource to uncover the truth.\" \"They are rigorously backtracking and scrutinizing all vessels that were in the vicinity at the time,\" Romualdez said. Romualdez called on government agencies to extend aid to the families of fallen fisherfolk. “To assist the bereaved families during their time of grief, we advise all government agencies concerned to reach out to them immediately and extend financial support, counseling services, and legal assistance,” Romualdez said. “In these trying times, it is essential that we come together as a nation to support one another, especially the families affected,” he added. Romualdez called on all parties to “uphold maritime laws and international principles, and prioritize the safety and welfare of all individuals at sea.” House Deputy Minority Leader France Castro of ACT Teachers party-list called for more Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) patrols. The PCG initially reported that based on the accounts of surviving crew the boat was rammed around 4:30 am on Monday while they were preparing to fish some 85 nautical miles northwest of the shoal. The mother boat sank, killing three of its crew members including its captain. The incident was reported to the PCG at around 10 am on Tuesday, October 3, after the 11 surviving crew members of the Dearyn and their 3 dead finally made their way to Barangay Cato, Infanta, Pangasinan. The PCG said the foreign commercial vessel was identified as the Pacific Anna, a crude oil tanker registered under the flag of the Marshall Islands. “Given that commercial vessels have the right of innocent passage, the incident could have been prevented if there were more PCG patrols in Bajo de Masinloc, aside from preventing such accidents they can also be more effective in protecting our waters and our fisherfolk,\" Castro said. \"We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of this act and we also hope that the funds for the PCG would be increased,” she added. \"Besides, [there's also] the harassment of Filipino fisherfolk by China's coast guard and militia have been happening for years and many were documented. Of course, we cannot forget what happened to the Gem Ver 1 fishing vessel as well as the incidents of Chinese coast guard water blasting Filipino fishing boats,\" Castro said. Castro was referring to the June 2019 incident wherein Filipino fishing boat Gem Ver 1 was sunk by a Chinese vessel in the Recto Bank which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone in West Philippine Sea. The 22 Gem-Ver 1 crew members on board, fortunately, were rescued by Vietnamese fisherfolk who saw the Filipinos around five hours after their boat was rammed by the Chinese. Senator Francis Tolentino, for his part, said the government should invest more on the Philippine National Police (PNP)’s Maritime Command (PNP-MC) in light of the tragedy. “I will propose that we increase the budget of PNP-MC, including the establishment of a base somewhere out there somewhere in Zambales, Palawan,” Tolentino said. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

During the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum, Diokno said the launch of the retail dollar bond offering for OFWs, which was initially planned before the year-end, will be in the “first quarter of next year.” In October, the Finance chief announced the government will be raising funds from the debt market with a planned retail bond offering targeting OFWs , who can purchase bonds using e-wallets. As to the amount to be raised from the planned bond offering, Diokno said, “I think around 10% of annual remittances, which is about $3 billion.” However, he said the DOF and the Bureau of the Treasury are still finalizing the details of the bond offering as well as its terms. Nonetheless, he said that OFWs can invest as low as $200. Early last month, the government raised $2 billion or around P117 billion from the issuance of triple-tranche dollar-denominated bonds including five-year and 10.5-year global bonds, and a 25-year ESG or environmental, social, and governance bond. This marked the Marco administration’s debut in the offshore debt market. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

This, as the DOH reiterated that there is no need for a new law to tackle the issue and that the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law of 2012 (RH Law) just needs proper implementation. One step to implementing the law properly is hiring health professionals or experts to teach the students, according to DOH Assistant Secretary Dr. Albert Domingo in an interview on Super Radyo dzBB. “Meron kasi tayong tinatawag na MAPEH, yung Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health. Ang implementation niton ay isa lang siya sa ‘MAPEH,” said Domingo. Instead of having only one teacher for MAPEH, Domingo said the \"Health\" subject must have a specific and adequately trained teacher. \"Mas maganda kung may designated na health teacher. Isipin niyo yung pe teacher, maton na basketball coach, tapos magtuturo din siya ng reproductive health. Parang medyo awkward yung dating. Dapat yung teacher ay properly trained, Hindi lahat at kontin lang ang merong health teacher. Baka iyan ang pwedeng solusyon,” explained Domingo. (It is better if there is a designated health teacher. Think of the PE teacher bullying the basketball coach; he will also teach reproductive health. The former seems a bit awkward. The teacher must be trained appropriately; not all, and only a few, have a health teacher. Maybe that could be the solution.) He added that since there is still a shortage of teachers in the country, employing some nurses in schools could be a solution. Meanwhile, Senate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros introduced a substitute bill to Senate Bill 1979 with amendments addressing concerns about Comprehensive Sexual Education (CSE). Hontiveros, chair of the Senate Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality Committee, expressed confidence that the revised bill would address President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.'s c oncerns about the previous version. DOH assured that they would help Congress to create measures to teach comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in schools more effectively.",

Speaking before reporters, Marcos allayed fears that the zero subsidy would interrupt the services of the state insurer. “Napakasimple lang ng guarantee ko — kahit may subsidy, kahit walang subsidy, kahit anong contribution, all of these issues, hindi mababawasan ang serbisyo ng Philhealth,” Marcos said. (My guarantee is very simple — whether there are subsidies or not, regardless of contributions, none of these issues will reduce the services of PhilHealth.) “Hindi mababawasan ang bayad ng Philhealth sa insurance claim. In fact baligtad. Padadamihin pa namin ang serbisyong ibibigay ng Philhealth, pararamihin, palalakihin pa namin ang pagbayad sa insurance claims,” he said. (The payments from PhilHealth for insurance claims will not decrease. In fact, it's the opposite. We will be increasing the services provided by PhilHealth and we will expand the payments for insurance claims.) Senate finance committee chairperson Grace Poe previously disclosed the PhilHealth will receive zero subsidy under the proposed 2025 national budget, saying the state insurer still has P600 billion reserve funds which they can use. “I would like to just assure everybody. Huwag nyong inaalaala na mababawasan ang serbisyo kahit na kanino…Quite the opposite. Dadagdagan natin yan in 2025, mas dadami pa ang magiging serbisyo na ibinibigay ng Philhealth, mas lalaki pa ang magiging payment na ibibigay sa insurance claim,” said Marcos. (I would like to assure everyone that there will be no reduction in services for anyone. Quite the opposite. We will be expanding those services in 2025; PhilHealth will offer even more services, and the payments for insurance claims will increase.) “Kaya huwag po kayong mag aalaala, walang mawawala sa serbisyo ng Philhealth. Mas pinapaganda pa nga naming ang pagpatakbo ng Philhealth para mas marami pang maibibigay sa taong bayan,” he said. (So please don't worry, there will be no loss of services from PhilHealth. In fact, we are improving the operation of PhilHealth so that we can provide even more to the public.) Last week, Marcos said PhilHealth has enough funds to continue delivering services despite the proposed zero subsidy. Health Secretary Ted Herbosa earlier said the state insurer still has a P150 billion surplus from its 2024 budget that could pay for the subsidy of indirect members. For its part, the PhilHealth assured the public of its sufficient funds to support beneficiaries but expressed hope that Marcos would reconsider the zero subsidy decision. Meanwhile, the DOH, which is PhilHealth's supervising agency, affirmed that services would remain uninterrupted. Senator JV Ejercito earlier said he would push for an oversight committee hearing to assess the implementation of the UHC Act, citing potential lapses in PhilHealth's role. —Sundy Locus/AOL, GMA Integrated News",

Interviewed on Dobol B TV, Gatchalian said, “Starting tomorrow... lahat by appointment.” “Kung 700 'yung kaya naman i-process. Ibibigay namin ang QR stubs for 700. Kapag naubos 'yung 700 at may nakapila pa, we'll do another 700 for the following day,” the DSWD chief said. The Cabinet official said that the agency is avoiding instances where one person will fall-in line to get an appointment stub then sell it to another. “Kapag pumila, sisiguraduhin dapat may dokumento at ID dahil sila lang ang mabibigyan ng QR code,” Gatchalian said. To implement the appointment system, he said, the agency will open more payout outlets in Metro Manila “in 45 to 60 days.” “Maglalagay tayo ng [payout outlet] for CAMANAVA, sa Monumento. Maglalagay tayo sa Pasig or Marikina para sa east. Maglalagay tayo sa Taguig para sa south. Magdadagdag pa tayo ng isang opening sa SM North. Maglalagay din tayo sa San Jose del Monte [Bulacan],” he said. “Kaya kami magbubukas ng payout outlets, in the future, magkakaroon na tayo ng territorial na approach. Kapag taga-CAMANAVA, 'wag na sila magpunta sa malayo, doon na sila sa Monumento [na payout outlet]. Kung ano ang address mo, doon ka na magpunta,” he added. —LBG, GMA Integrated News",

Of the 91 Filipino volunteers, Herbosa said 32 came from the DOH Philippine Emergency Medical Assistance Team (PEMAT), who were certified by the World Health Organization (WHO). This batch’s PEMAT, which came from the Eastern Visayas Medical Center, is composed of doctors, nurses, medical technologists, pharmacists, midwives, nursing attendants, and administrative, logistics, and technical staff. “Usually ang kanilang equipment, self-sustaining, good for two weeks. Kung kailangan mag-extend, magre-resupply tayo or magpapalit,” Herbosa said in a \"Balitanghali\" interview. (Usually their equipment is self-sustaining and is good for two weeks.

The death toll in Myanmar following the magnitude 7.7 earthquake last March 28 has reached 2,065, according to state media. More than 3,900 were injured and at least 270 were missing.

    "article_body": "The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said Wednesday the country’s export sales saw a decline in August, but exports of coconut oil has continued to increase year-to-date. Citing preliminary data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the DTI said the Philippines registered $6.4 billion in export sales in August, down 2% from $6.5 billion in the same month last year. The Trade department said exports “were dragged by the year-on-year decline in exports of electronic products, other mineral products, machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals, which comprise 66.5% share of the country’s total exports in August 2022.” Nonetheless, year-to-date export sales amounted to $51.2 billion, up 4.4% or $2.2 billion higher than the same period last year. “[C]umulative export growth was driven by higher sales generated from coconut oil, other mineral products, chemicals, other manufactured products, and electronic products,” the DTI said. Moreover, it said that coconut oil ranked as the country’s fastest-growing export commodity group, recording a 96.2% year-to-date growth with cumulative export sales reaching $1.6 billion from January to August this year. Export earnings from coconut oil in August alone also increased to $168.2 million, up 26.6% year-on-year from to $132.9 million. “Overall, coconut oil exports have consistently been increasing at double-digit growth rates compared to three time periods: 2021, 2020, and the pre-pandemic average from 2017 to 2019,” the DTI said. The Trade department said that based on Fortune Business Insights’ Regional Forecast and COVID-19 Impact Analysis on Coconut Derivatives for 2020-2027, “several positive outcomes supported the coconut derivative market growth during the COVID-19 outbreak, which includes the rising awareness of the benefits of coconut oil usage.” “In the Philippines, scientists have also started studying virgin coconut oil (VCO) as a potential treatment for coronavirus,” it said. It added that the rapid spread of veganism globally has also resulted in increased demand for plant-based products, including coconut oil and coconut milk which are becoming considered globally as alternatives to animal fats and animal milk, respectively. Based on the International Trade Centre's Export Potential Assessment, the Philippines has the potential to expand its exports of coconut products to $2.1 billion, it said. “The DTI has been at the forefront in promoting the coconut sector in international markets. Under the Coconut Farmers and Industry Development Plan (CFIDP), the Department has been assisting coconut farmer enterprises in entering/growing their presence in global markets through the implementation of extensive market research and strategies for the promotion of coconut products,” said Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual. “We are confident that with the right set of marketing strategies, coconut products will gain more traction in international markets, especially as more markets discover the numerous health benefits of coconut products, particularly coconut oil,” the Trade chief said. —LBG, GMA News",

Espiritu said the Summit next month could be an instrument to tackle the ASEAN-EU free trade agreement, which, according to him, has been stalled for years. \"The ASEAN-EU FTA has started—the talk on that, the negotiations have started almost ten years ago. But somewhere along the way, it’s stalled and up to this point, there is still no progress on that. And so far, there is no plan yet or there is concrete discussion yet on the resumption of such talks,\" he said. \"Now, the coming ASEAN Summit will be just an ASEAN Summit. We will have a separate commemorative summit in Brussels for ASEAN-EU in December, and I think that could be a good venue for a discussion on that. Although, there is nothing yet on the table, as far as we are concerned today,\" he added. Earlier, the European Union has invited Marcos to visit its headquarters in Belgium to discuss foreign policy issues and bilateral relations between the Philippines and the bloc. The Philippines and the EU signed the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which provided an “enhanced legal framework,\" enabling both parties “to strengthen their bilateral relationship, in particular on political, social, and economic matters.\" —LDF, GMA News",

    "article_body": "It is highly possible that the 11 Chinese nationals who were arrested in Paracale, Camarines Norte were attempting to mine uranium, an official of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) said Tuesday. PAOCC spokesperson Dr. Winston Casio said they were told by engineers that the extraction technology of the foreigners could be used to extract uranium. He also said there were also possible sources of uranium in the area. “Kung kaya po, gawa ng iba ang teknolohiyang ginamit nitong grupong ito, it’s highly possible na hindi lang gold ang kanilang hinahanap kung hindi maging uranium deposits,” he said in an interview on Super Radyo dzBB. (Because the technology used by the group was not ordinary, it is highly possible that they were not only looking for gold but also for uranium deposits.) “As of this point, hindi pa naman po confirmed ‘yan. Kaya lang nasabi ng engineer na tumingin niyan sapagkat ‘yung technology na ginamit ay pu-puwedeng magamit for uranium extraction,” he later added. (As of this point this is not yet confirmed. But according to the engineers, the technology being used could be for uranium extraction.) According to the Department of Energy (DOE), uranium can be used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity. It also used to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial, and defense purposes around the world. Authorities arrested the 11 Chinese nationals over the weekend for working in an illegal mine site and for having only tourist visas. According to Casio, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau had closed off the area. “Kinakailangan ho natin mag-request sa kanila na tignan ng mabuti kung ano nga ba talaga ang purpose nung extraction plant na ito,” he said. (We need to request for them to look into the purpose of the extraction plant.) Casio said the company has the necessary environmental compliance certificate (ECC) to operate, but it has expanded beyond the coverage of the license. The arrested Chinese nationals have already undergone inquest proceedings for immigration violations. Casio said authorities are also eyeing to file criminal complaints against them. Casio said they are also investigating a local politician who may be the Chinese nationals' business partner. He said the politician hired two of the foreigners as business financiers while the rest were hired as technical experts and workers for the mineral processing plant. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Secretary Susan \"Toots\" Ople on Monday vowed justice for slain overseas Filipino worker Jullebee Ranara as she condoles with the grieving family of the OFW. According to the DMW, the burned body of the 35-year old domestic worker was found on Sunday in the desert. The agency said Kuwaiti authorities have arrested the son of the victim's employer. Ople, for her part, already reached out to the family of the victim. Ople vowed to provide assistance to the family of Ranara. At present, the DMW is waiting for the official report on the incident from foreign authorities. The family of the victim is requesting privacy as they grieve the death of Ranara, the DMW said. The DMW condemned the heinous crime and called on the Kuwaiti government to work on the early resolution of the case and bring the perpetrators to justice. Aside from the DMW, the Department of Foreign Affairs is also monitoring developments on the case and working as well with Kuwaiti authorities. Ranara's death is the latest of Fililpino fatalities in Kuwait in the recent years. Former President Rodrigo Duterte earlier directed the OFW deployment ban to Kuwait following the killing of Filipina domestic worker Joanna Daniela Demafelis in 2018. Demafelis was found in a freezer at an abandoned apartment in the Gulf state. Reports said Demafelis' employers, a Lebanese man and his Syrian wife, hid the body in the freezer before fleeing the apartment. Duterte then appealed to Arab nations to treat Filipino workers with dignity and respect. A partial lifting of the ban took place in May 2018 after the signing of the protection deal for overseas Filipino workers in the Gulf state. But in May 2019, the Labor Department said 47-year-old overseas Filipino worker Constancia Lago Dayag died at the hands of her employer also in Kuwait. In 2020, it was reported that Jeanelyn Villavende was killed by her female employer in Kuwait due to jealousy on December 28, 2019. Results of the autopsy made by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health showed that the victim died after multiple organ failure following severe beating. Reports said Villavende’s female employer was served the death penalty while her husband was charged with 4-year imprisonment for covering up and not reporting the crime. Ban lifted In February 2020, the Philippine government lifted the deployment ban of Filipino migrant workers to Kuwait . Then- Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III made the announcement after the Kuwaiti government conceded to the conditions set by the Philippines during a board meeting at the time. The Kuwaiti government has already met one of the conditions set by the Philippines, which is to file charges against the employers of Villavende. Bello also said that Kuwaiti officials have agreed to craft a harmonized standard employment contract for Filipino workers. Under the new contract, Filipino workers will be allowed to take one day off with pay each week. The contract will also state the designated working and sleeping hours of the worker. Over the weekend, the DMW said it was looking to repatriate all distressed overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Kuwait by the end of January . Of the 421 distressed Kuwait OFWs, the DWM had repatriated 142 since January 17, 2023. — Anna Felicia Bajo/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

Wearing a black polo shirt and fatigue pants, Zelenskyy met with President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. this morning at Malacañang Palace. ''Thank you for this invitation and we are very thankful to be in your country which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thank you so much of your big word, and clear position about us, about this Russian occupation of our territories and thank you on your support on the, in your nations, with your resolutions,'' Zelenskyy told Marcos. ''Mr. President, I’m happy to hear today from you that you participate [in] our peace steps,'' he added. In response, Marcos said the Philippines is very much willing to continue helping Ukraine through multilateral platforms such as the United Nations and the European Union in order to achieve peace amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. ''We’ll continue to do all that we can to promote.... to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,'' Marcos said. ''I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,” he added. Marcos stressed that the Philippine government has been promoting the adherence to international rules-based order as he reiterates the country's advocacy for peace. Zelenskyy also said in a post on X that the Philippines would participate in the peace summit that will be held in Switzerland this month. ''We discussed the inaugural Global Peace Summit and the importance of Southeast Asian countries being represented there. I am pleased that the Philippines will participate in the Summit,'' he added. There is no official word yet from the Philippine government howerver on whether Marcos would personally attend the Global Peace Summit or a representative will be sent. 'Elated' Marcos was elated over Zelenskyy's visit to discuss issues similarly faced by the two countries. Marcos, though, expressed hope that their meeting would be under ''better circumstances'' amid the unfinished war Ukraine is facing against Russia. Zelenskyy also told Marcos Ukraine would open an embassy in the Philippines this year. The Ukrainian president arrived in Manila on Sunday evening for a visit that was kept well under wraps. He flew in first to Singapore on Saturday, June 1, for what Reuters described as an \"unscheduled\" appearance at the Shangri-La Dialogue. The Philippines had expressed its support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, voting at the UN General Assembly to denounce Russia’s invasion, expressing “explicit condemnation” against “the use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of any state.” —KG/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Speaking before his counterparts in the region, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. urged member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to unite amid ongoing threats in the West Philippine Sea. In a statement, the Department of National Defense (DND) said Teodoro made the call during a speech Wednesday at the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) Retreat in Penang, Malaysia. \"ASEAN has ensured the longest period of peace in any region since World War II. However, this peace is now under threat—not due to our incapacity to preserve it, but because of the absence of unanimity on key issues,\" he said. Teodoro said threats to Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the WPS are not just a domestic or regional concern, but a \"global issue\" that affects international stability. The ASEAN needs to remain cohesive and proactive in upholding regional stability, Teodoro said, as well as in defending international law and norms. The Philippine defense chief urged the ASEAN to enhance operational cooperation by expanding joint patrols, exercises, and intelligence-sharing to build trust among defense forces. He also warned against external attempts to sow division within Southeast Asia and advised member-states to reject external influences that seek to fragment the region. For Teodoro, the ASEAN must maintain independence and strategic autonomy. The Philippine defense chief also cited criminal activities that threaten the region. \"We should resist coercion in whatever form and exchange information on foreign activities that are inimical to our national interests, such as online scams, trafficking in persons, illegal migration, which destroy the fabric of our respective societies,\" he said. \"We may not always agree, but the spirit of ASEAN compels us to cooperate where we can, consult where necessary, and act when we must,\" he added. Tensions continue as Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual shipborne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Parts of the South China Sea that fall within Philippine territory have been renamed by the government as West Philippine Sea to reinforce the country's claim. The West Philippine Sea refers to the maritime areas on the western side of the Philippine archipelago including Luzon Sea and the waters around, within and adjacent to the Kalayaan Island Group and Bajo de Masinloc. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines over China's claims in the South China Sea, saying that it had \"no legal basis.\" China has refused to recognize the decision. — VDV, GMA Integrated News",

Marcos said Justice Secretary Remulla is \"very aware that he must allow the processes of the judiciary to work properly and that no one in the Executive must interfere.\" He also said Justice chief has taken the \"very proper position\" of recusing himself from any involvement in his son's case. Juanito was nabbed in connection with the shipment that was intercepted at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. A report on the arrest and seizure showed that authorities confiscated one parcel containing 937 grams of dried leaves of suspected kush \"with a current street value of P1,311,800.\" The operation, a controlled delivery, was conducted by agents from the PDEA and the NAIA Inter-Agency Drug Interdiction Task Group at BF Resort Village in Talon Dos, Las Piñas on October 11 around 11:10 a.m. The elder Remulla has said he would not intervene in his son's \"predicament.\" He also said it is a difficult time for him and his family. “I am both a father and the secretary of Justice, roles that I take very seriously. We all know about unconditional love, but at 38 years old, he will have to face his predicament as a fully emancipated child,” Remulla said. \"I will not intervene in nor influence my son’s predicament, and I have not done so in any way… A person should always face the consequence of their actions and I will let justice take its own course,\" he added. Remulla earlier said he arrived in the Philippines from Geneva, where he attended the United Nations Human Rights Committee, on Thursday afternoon. PDEA said a complaint for importation of dangerous drugs under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and for failure to exhibit or deposit documents under the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act has been filed against the younger Remulla. In a message to reporters, Prosecutor General Benedicto Malcontento said prosecutors in Las Piñas will handle the matter fairly. \"Clear and directions ni SOJ dyan. He will not interfere. Rest assured that our prosecutors in Las Pinas will resolve the matter fairly and independently,\" Malcontento said. —with Joahna Lei Casilao/KBK/RSJ, GMA News",

    "article_body": "The Bureau of Customs (BOC) said Friday its strict border control measures against illicit cash smuggling have played a crucial role in the Philippines’ removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List. According to the BOC, its intensified crackdown against smuggling, deployment of cash-sniffing dogs, upgraded baggage scanning systems and expanded capacity-building for customs personnel led to a 455-fold increase in currency declarations as well as in 194 cash seizures in 2024 alone. To recall, the Philippines is no longer among the countries under the watch of an international body for money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In a statement issued over the weekend, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced that the Philippines is no longer under increased monitoring. When the FATF places a country under “grey list” or increased monitoring, it means that a country committed to resolving the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring. The BOC said that the deployment of cash-sniffing dogs in major ports and the installation of advanced baggage scanning equipment have improved the detection of undeclared and suspicious currency. Further, the agency intensified its capacity-building initiatives, training customs personnel on AML/CTF protocols and enhancing intelligence-sharing with the Department of Information and Communications Technology, Philippine Coast Guard, Office of Transportation Security, Department of Justice, and the Anti-Money Laundering Council. These efforts resulted in an unprecedented increase in enforcement actions, with the number of cash seizures in 2024 exceeding the total recorded in the previous decade. — Anna Felicia Bajo/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2024-03-06T18:02:00",
    "article_body": "The Department of Energy (DOE) on Wednesday welcomed the Supreme Court (SC) decision which affirmed its authority to take over the oil industry in times of emergency. In a 37-page decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals’ ruling that declared Section 14(e) of Republic Act 8479 or Oil Deregulation Law unconstitutional. Section 14(e) of the law states that “in times of national emergency, when the public interest so requires, the DOE may, during the emergency and under reasonable terms prescribed by it, temporarily take over or direct the operation of any person or entity engaged in the Industry.” The SC, in its decision, said Section 14(e) of RA 8479 is “a proper delegation of takeover power to the DOE.” With this, the DOE said it respects and supports the ruling of the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of Section 14(e) of Oil Deregulation law that authorizes the DOE in times of national emergency to temporarily take over or direct the operation of any person or entity engaged in the downstream oil industry. “The DOE is committed to implementing Section 14(e) of the said law as the public interest may require in times of national emergency, in accordance with the Constitution and the applicable laws and consistent with the President’s intent or instructions,” the Energy Department said. “The DOE will study fully with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General the clarifications made by the Supreme Court and will take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that this measure of last resort is properly exercised whenever needed,” it added. The SC cited Section 23 of the Constitution that provides limitations on the takeover power. “In line with this constitutional provision is a well-established doctrine of qualified political agency. The doctrine recognizes the multifarious responsibilities a president faces, which calls for the delegation of certain responsibilities to cabinet members,” the high court said. “It posits that the heads of the various executive departments stand as the president’s alter egos permitted to act on behalf of the president,” it added. However, the Court said that if the energy secretary acts in contrast with the president’s intent or instruction, the act will be deemed ultra vires (acting or done beyond one's legal power or authority) and an unconstitutional usurpation of executive power. “Moreover, it must first be demonstrated that the president withheld approval or repudiated the delegation or the actions of the delegated authority,” the SC added. The DOE said it will also continue to consult and work with all stakeholders on maximizing and diversifying sources of energy supply, enhancing its distribution and availability to the public at reasonable prices, managing the prioritization of demand to avoid or minimize potential constraints, and strengthening overall capacity to bounce back from interruptions. — Ted Cordero/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno on Wednesday expressed optimism that the government will surpass its collection goal this year, banking on the Bureau of Customs (BOC) revenue surplus. “Our collection as of one month ago is P2.9 trillion, [over] 18% higher than last year and about 90% of our goal for the year,” Diokno said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. “I’m very sure we will exceed our revenue target,” he added. Data from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) showed that the national government’s revenues as of end-October stood at P2.9 trillion , up 18.31% from P2.5 billion raised in January to October 2021. The cumulative collections are 89% of the P3.3 trillion revenue target for the entire year. Diokno said the BOC already met its annual target while the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) was “slightly behind.” From January to October, the Customs collected P713.5 billion, up 35.81% year-on-year and 99% of the P721.5 billion full-year goal. On the other hand, the BIR collected P1.9 trillion, 12.56% over the same period last year and reaching 80% of the P2.4 trillion target. Asked if the revenue surplus of the BOC will be enough to cover the shortfall of the BIR, Diokno said, “Definitely.” The BOC earlier reported that it collected P745.50 billion as of November 11, surpassing its collection target of P721.52 billion for the entire year by P23.98 billion or 3.27% . The Customs attributed the positive revenue performance to stringent implementation of priority programs to curb smuggling and corruption, optimize revenue collection, and digitalize and enhance customs operations anchored on the eight-point Socioeconomic Agenda of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, Diokno said the economic managers or the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBBC) will meet on December 5 to review the government’s macroeconomic targets. “We will review the numbers and maybe we can upgrade the forecast, but we will just affirm the 6.5 to 8% [for next year,” he said. The economy as measured by GDP, or the total value of goods and services produced, grew by 7.6%during the July to September period, faster than the upwardly adjusted 7.5% GDP growth in the second quarter of the year. The DBCC set a GDP growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% for 2022 and 6.5% to 8% for 2023. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Friday approved fare increases for traditional and modern jeepneys, buses, taxis, and transport network vehicle services (TNVS). In a statement, the LTFRB said it released a decision on the petitions filed by several transport groups. The public land transportation regulator approved a P1 provisional increase in the minimum fare for first four kilometers travel in both traditional and modern jeepneys. “Upon the effectivity of the decision, the minimum fare for traditional public utility jeepney (TPUJ) will be P12, while for modern PUJ (MPUJ) will be at P14,” the LTFRB said. The agency also green-lighted an additional fare of P0.30 per succeeding kilometer for TPUJ, while an additional P0.40 per succeeding kilometer will be implemented for MPUJ. “Based on the increase, the fare for succeeding kilometer run TPUJ will be P1.80 from the current P1.50, while for MPUJ will be P2.20 from P1.80,” the LTFRB said. For public utility buses (PUB), the land transportation regulator approved a P2 uniformed base fare hike for city and provincial buses for the first five kilometers and the succeeding kilometer fare increase of P0.35 to P0.50 depending on the type of bus. The LTFRB said PUB operators asked for P4 to P7 base fare hikes and per succeeding kilometer rate ranging from P0.45 to P1.20. The flagdown rate for taxis and TNVS was also adjusted upwards by P5.00. “Upon effectivity of the decision, the minimum fare for taxis and Sedan-type TNVS will be P45, while AUV/SUV-type TNVS will be at P55. For hatchback-type TNVS, flagdown rate will be P35,” the LTFRB said. “There will be no increase in the succeeding kilometers,” it said. The decision on fare increases will take effect 15 days after publication in a newspaper of general circulation or around the first week of October. The LTFRB said the 20% discount for senior citizens, persons with disability and students will still be effective. The agency earlier said that it recognizes the need for a fare increase following the continuing rise of oil prices. The LTFRB said it consulted the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) on the matter. “In the decision released by LTFRB, the agency conducted a study through its Franchise Planning and Monitoring Division (FPMD),” it said. The FPMD used the fare adjustment formula based on Memorandum Circular 2019-035, the opinion of different stakeholders, increasing operational cost of PUVs and the opinion of the NEDA, according to the LTFRB. Moving forward, the agency reminded drivers to follow the guidelines and policies of the agency, and adhere to public health safety protocols. Violations will be dealt with accordingly. —NB, GMA News",

    "article_body": "The COVID-19 pandemic showed the Philippines could ill afford to continue its dependence on importation to have a sufficient supply of food at affordable prices, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. has said. Asked at the 10th Asia Summit in Singapore about the Philippine economy post pandemic, Marcos said the country had \"come back fairly well... we have been able to return people to work and we just posted a 96% employment rate.\" Marcos, however, pointed out that the Philippines had been hounded by problems on supply chains and agricultural production. \"But this is a lesson that we immediately learn. I said, we cannot now continue to depend on importation which is what has happened for the Philippines. In the past years, it became the easy way out,\" Marcos said. \"Just import more, import more rice, import more corn, import more everything. And the pandemic showed us that this was not a wise choice to have made,\" he added. Marcos said the Philippines continued to develop its agricultural sector \"and the aspiration once again is that we are able to provide sufficient supply of food at prices that people can afford.\" \"We are not there yet but we have made many important steps to start that,\" Marcos said. \"We are trying to put the value chain, especially of agriculture, we are trying to put that value chain together, all the way from R&D, all the way to retail, to the market,\" he added. Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno over the weekend said the department had proposed the reduction of the 35% rice import tariff rates \"both ASEAN and MFN [most favored nation] rates, temporarily to 0% or maximum of 10% to arrest the surge in rice prices.\" Diokno said rice was the biggest contributor to inflation as he emphasized the need to propose a tariff reduction for rice imports. Marcos in early September ordered the imposition of price ceilings on regular and well-milled rice . Regular rice's price cap is at P41; well-milled rice at P45. He said the measure was only temporary and adverted to rice imports that will soon arrive. Marcos has blamed smugglers and hoarders for the increase in the prices of rice. The Department of Agriculture in mid-August recommended the importation of 500,000 metric tons of rice to address the thin supply in the buffer stock. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

To recall, the FDA endorsed 20 more medicines for cancer, hypertension, and mental illness to be exempted from value-added tax (VAT), making them more affordable for those in need of them.

    "date_published": "2024-08-01T14:34:00",
    "article_body": "Information from other agencies show that suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo is still in the Philippines, the Department of Justice said Thursday. “Yung whereabouts ni Mayor Guo, meron naman kami, may information mula sa ibang mga ahensya, ‘yung mga kawani, na nandito pa siya sa Pilipinas,” Justice Undersecretary Nicky Ty said in a press briefing. (As for the whereabouts of Mayor Guo, we have information from other agencies that she is still here in the Philippines.) The embattled mayor is facing an arrest order from the Senate after she repeatedly failed to attend its inquiry on the raided Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) hub in her locality. Earlier in June, the Department of the Interior and Local Government filed graft charges against Guo with the Office of the Ombudsman, prompting it to suspend her for up to six months. Authorities have also filed a human trafficking complaint with the DOJ against Guo in relation to the POGO hub in Bamban. Guo did not personally attend the preliminary hearings of the department. She was represented by her lawyers. Guo’s lawyer, Atty. Stephen David, said his client talked to him on Wednesday night and assured him that she was still in the country. “Ang assurance niya sa akin na nandito naman siya sa Pilipinas (she assured me that she is still in the Philippines),” he said in an interview on Balitanghali. Despite this, David said that Guo is unlikely to attend the Senate hearings. According to Ty, the next preliminary hearing will be held on August 6, where Guo’s camp is expected to file their counter affidavit on the complaint. Meanwhile, Guo’s citizenship is also being questioned due to her inconsistent testimonies about her background and the supposed dubious documents regarding her Filipino citizenship. The Office of the Solicitor General has also filed a quo warranto petition against Guo, which may result in her removal from public office. In July, it filed a petition seeking to cancel Guo’s birth certificate. The OSG earlier said if cancelled, Guo would lose her most important defense evidence about her identity. Meanwhile, David said the quo warranto petition against Guo is premature, noting that she has a birth certificate. “May presumption of regularity tayo. Kaya nga nag file sila ng kaso sa Tarlac, pinapa walang bisa ‘yung kanyang birth certificate. Edi dapat antayin muna nila ‘yung resulta noon,” David said. (There is a presumption of regularity. That’s why they filed a case before Tarlac asking the court to nullify her birth certificate. They should first wait the result on that.) “Kung totoong hindi siya Pilipino, tsaka sila mag file ng quo warranto (if it’s true that she is not a Filipino, then they can file the quo warranto),” he added. David said they have yet to receive an official copy of the petition, but that he will file a motion to dismiss. — AOL/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

In a statement, the BAI said that, on April 30, its Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Laboratory reported positive results from duck samples collected during a routine surveillance by the DA Regional Field Office V (DA-RFO V). It said that the subtype H5N9, while highly pathogenic in birds, “poses low risk to humans based on current global assessments.” Following the detection, the BAI said it promptly endorsed disease control measures to DA-RFO V, including immediate quarantine, culling, surveillance, and coordination with local authorities, and notified the Department of Health (DOH) to monitor any potential human exposure. The DA-RFO V had also activated its Command Center and convened its Regional Quick Response Team to enforce control protocols. The agency said coordination meetings with the regional DOH, the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur, and the Municipality of Camaligan have also been conducted to streamline actions. “Culling and proper disposal of the remaining ducks in the affected farms were done on May 6, 2025,” it said. “Intensive surveillance within the one-kilometer quarantine zone will begin today, May 7, 2025, followed by monitoring and disinfection measures,” it added. The DA RFO V, in close coordination with the BAI and local government units, will also implement sustained disease control operations including surveillance within the one-kilometer and seven-kilometer zones and thorough cleaning and disinfection of affected sites to prevent further spread. “Rest assured that BAI is committed to protecting the Philippine's poultry industry from the threat of avian influenza and will maintain close cooperation with other government agencies and stakeholders,” the agency said. “We encourage the public to remain vigilant and report any unusual poultry deaths or signs of illness to local authorities for immediate action,” it added. —VAL, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2025-04-02T17:00:00",
    "article_body": "The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Wednesday said it is considering measures including having pork retailers display product details such as their suppliers, as the majority are still not complying with the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) set by the agency last month. According to DA spokesperson Arnel de Mesa, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. wants retailers to display the farms that supply them with pork, aside from the certificate from the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) that consumers see regarding the slaughter, to determine which suppliers are still selling at higher rates. This comes as De Mesa said that there is only 39% compliance with the MSRP, which has already seen a gradual increase since its March 10 implementation: P300 per kilo for fresh carcass or “sabit ulo,” P350 per kilo for kasim and pigue, and P380 per kilo for liempo. Citing price monitoring efforts of the DA, de Mesa said several retailers still have prices above the MSRP, as in the case of those in markets such as in Pritil Market, Trabajo Market, and Cartimar Market. Latest available data from the DA’s price monitoring on its website shows that prices of kasim and pigue ranged from P340.00 to P400.00 per kilo, and liempo from P350.00 to P470.00 per kilo in Metro Manila markets as of Monday, March 31, 2025. “[The Secretary said that he] was very disappointed with what happened coming from the agreements among the stakeholders and with the department,” De Mesa said in a briefing on Wednesday. Retailers have since admitted difficulties in complying with the MSRP , as they said they cannot sell other pork cuts, forcing them to offset losses through kasim and liempo sales. They also cited expenses for biosecurity amid threats of illness such as the African swine flu. “‘Yung sa baboy, parang he felt na madali ‘yung naging mga nagkasunduan, so medyo kinabahan siya dahil naging madali ‘yung agreement, baka magkaroon ng problema ang that’s happened,” De Mesa said. “So he shared na kapag madali, ‘pag minsan may problema, so ngayon, dahil may ganitong issue, talagang siyempre kailangan din gumawa ng paraan para masolusyonan,” he added. (For pork, he felt that the agreement was easy, so he was slightly nervous that there would be a problem, and that’s happened. So he shared that if it is easy, sometimes there are problems so now, because of this issue, we really need to make ways to address this.) — BM, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Twenty-seven victims were rescued while 10 individuals were arrested for human trafficking in separate operations in Pasay City, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said Tuesday. NBI Director Jaime Santiago said that of those rescued, six were minors. Santiago said they have been turned over to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. Meanwhile, six of those arrested are Chinese while four are Filipinos. \"Napa-inquest na natin sila and they were accordingly charged (They have undergone inquest proceedings and they were accordingly charged),\" Santiago said in a press conference. According to NBI Cybercrime Division Chief Atty. Jeremy Lotoc said this stemmed from two operations within a week. Lotoc said that the crime involved foreign nationals and their modus was called the \"Romeo Method\" or the \"Loverboy Tactic.\" He said their objective was to establish romantic relationships with their victim and then \"groom\" them. \"'Yung grooming. Nililigawan nila ito and then tine-treat nila specially. And then 'yung isolation. So ina-isolate nila ito sa kanilang friends and families to make the victim dependent doon sa trafficker in terms of financial needs and emotional needs,\" he said. (The grooming. They court the individual and treat him or her specially. Then there's the isolation. So they isolate the victim from their friends and families to make them dependent on the trafficker in terms of financial and emotional needs.) Following this, he said the victims would then be exploited and brought into the sex trade. He said the minors were offered through a messaging app. In a statement, the NBI said the arrests were the result of operations on Sept. 6 and 7, when agents raided units of a condominium complex in Pasay City. The alleged Chinese ringleader and two companions were nabbed during hot pursuit, the NBI said. \"The operatives also discovered that the group is using various technologies such as social media and online platforms, generative AI, encryption and anonymity tools, and online market place in their illegal sex trade, offering trafficked victims for sexual service, including minors,\" the statement said. — VDV, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Information and Communications Technology on Tuesday warned the public about the spread of \"deepfakes\"—videos that mimic the voices and images of prominent personalities—as the 2025 midterm elections draw near. According to Jonathan Andal's report on \"24 Oras,\" the DICT called on the House of Representatives to craft a law to regulate artificial intelligence which is being used to come up with false footage. \"We believe that, especially with the upcoming elections, this particular threat might increase,\" DICT Undersecretary Jeff Ian Dy said before a House committee hearing. He cited the fake videos that featured the face and voice of GMA host Susan Enriquez, who was made to appear that she was promoting the distribution of a particular necklace from Italy. “Gamit po ang kanyang video, pati yung kanyang audio recording na di-nub doon sa video niya to make it look like she’s endorsing a particular product, when in fact she did not,” he added. (They used her video and her audio recording, dubbed in the video to make it look like she's endorsing a particular product when she was not.) Cybersecurity expert Art Samaniego said a law is needed to prevent the threat of AI before the elections. \"Wala pa tayong batas laban sa deep fakes. Malapit na po ang election dapat gumawa tayo ng batas dito para ma-regulate ang paggamit ng AI,” Samaniego said. (We still don't have a law against deep fakes. The election is coming. We should make a law to regulate the use of AI.) Aside from the deepfakes, the DICT also reported that Chinese hackers caused the cyber attack that happened on some government websites. Among those targeted by hackers are the websites of those watching over the West Philippine Sea, namely the Philippine Coast Guard and the National Coast Watch System. They also targeted DICT, the Department of Justice, the Congressional Police and Budget Research Department of the House of Representatives, and President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.'s private website. However, the DICT said they currently have no evidence to say that this hacking attempt has the blessing of the Chinese government. \"The type of attack used is very sophisticated. I would call it theoretically perfect — pinagaralan at magagaling yung gumawa ng malware,” said Dy. (The malware's creator is good, and it was thoroughly studied.) —Sherylin Untalan/NB, GMA Integrated News",

In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) underscored \"the need for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the UN Charter.\" \"The Philippines has articulated its principled position on Ukraine and has consistently supported Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, voting in favor of the six resolutions of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session on Ukraine,\" the DFA said. Ukraine was home to nearly 400 Filipinos and since the war broke out, the Philippine government was able to bring home dozens of Filipinos from the eastern European state. Russian troops launched their attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, drawing international condemnations, warnings and sanctions from countries, led by the US, with US President Joe Biden calling Moscow’s move “unprovoked and unjustified.” At the UN, the Philippines joined 140 countries in denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, expressing “explicit condemnation” against “the use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of any state.” \"The Philippines reiterates its call on concerned parties to seek a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the conflict,\" the DFA said as it cited the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes which reaffirms the principle that all states shall settle their disputes by peaceful means. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

Citing DSWD data, the report said that as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, over P100M was paid out to to over 42,000 beneficiaries. In Casiguran, Aurora, some senior citizens queued up for the payout but were sent home since they had no confirmed schedule. Other walk-in applicants insisted that they submitted an online registration but received no text confirmation. Some argued they could not open the website, but the DSWD said that the technical issue is just temporary. Meanwhile, the cash distribution was canceled in Batanes, Ilocos Sur, and Tanay, Rizal, due to bad weather conditions. Authorities said they would resume distribution on another day. For those who do not have gadgets or access online, the DSWD is conducting an off-site payout. They are currently cooperating with the local government units to find the poorest of the poor to distribute the education assistance, which is ongoing in Calabarozon, Mimaropa, and Western Visayas.

    "article_body": "The Holy Week exodus to holiday destinations begins in earnest today, alongside the rites of Palm Sunday. All agencies of the national and local governments must ensure the safety of the public in this peak travel season. This includes ensuring the travel worthiness of mass transport facilities on land, sea and air. The nation has seen too many deadly road accidents due to the loss of brakes on poorly maintained vehicles as well as reckless driving. Inter-island ferries have also sunk and motorized boats have capsized even in calm waters and fine summer weather due to overloading, with passengers drowning because of the absence of requisite lifesavers. Before the weekend, the Maritime Industry Authority announced that it had suspended four ships due to safety issues. Authorities in smaller ports must also tighten inspection of vessels used for public transport. An audit of the structural integrity of public works infrastructure has yet to get underway, over a month after a section of a new bridge in Isabela province collapsed after a truck transporting rocks drove through it. While waiting for experts to inspect structural integrity, public works personnel and local government units can display prominently at the entrance to bridges advisories on weight and height limits for vehicles, and promote compliance. Owners of mass transport and logistics enterprises must do their part by ensuring the roadworthiness of their vehicles and compliance with weight and height limits. Public safety includes protection from scams and violent crimes. The Department of Tourism is encouraging the public to book accommodations and other travel-related requirements only with accredited establishments to avoid scams. The Philippine National Police, assisted by local force multipliers, must intensify patrols and other security measures. The PNP has yet to catch the killers of a Slovak tourist who was found dead with signs of rape and beating in Boracay, one of the country’s top travel destinations. Metro Manila, meanwhile, which typically becomes like a ghost town during the Holy Week break, must be secured from burglars. Firefighters must be on alert as fires can break out in homes and workplaces whose occupants are on vacation. The country has had sufficient experience with possible problems during the Holy Week break. There is no excuse to be unprepared.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of National Defense ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to ramp up its presence in the West Philippine Sea to defend the country’s territory amid reports of encroachment. The DND gave the marching orders on Thursday following Bloomberg’s report, citing unnamed Western officials, earlier this week that detailed how Beijing is reclaiming more land in Spratly Islands, particularly over Eldad Reef (Malvar Reef), Lankiam Cay (Panata Island), Whitsun Reef (Julian Felipe Reef), and Sandy Cay. The activities were monitored close to Pag-asa Island. “Any encroachment in the West Philippine Sea or reclamation on features therein is a threat to the security of Pag-asa Island, which is part of Philippine sovereign territory,” the Defense department said in a statement. “It also endangers the marine environment and undermines the stability of the region.” The DND also called on China to uphold international rules-based order and avoid actions that can further increase tensions in the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier expressed concern and said that “relevant” agencies are verifying details of the report. It added that the activities were breaching the Declaration of Conduct on the South China Sea (DOC) as well as the 2016 Hague ruling, which Beijing refuses to recognize. READ: Philippines ‘concerned’ over report on China’s construction activities in Spratlys However, China has denied claims on the Bloomberg report, with Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that the report is “completely untrue.” “Refraining from action on the presently uninhabited islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands is a serious common understanding reached by China and ASEAN countries in the [DOC] and China always strictly abides by it,” Mao said in a press concerence on Wednesday. “The growth of China-Philippines relations currently enjoys sound momentum, and the two sides will continue to properly handle maritime issues through friendly consultations.” The development comes less than two weeks before President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. visits China upon the invitation of President Xi Jinping. Analysts have called on the chief executive to bring up the issue during his meeting with his Chinese counterpart, making clear the Philippines’ foreign policy on the West Philippine Sea.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang asserted on Sunday that there is no basis for Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa to seek assistance from the US in freezing the assets of the owner of the aircraft that flew former president Rodrigo Duterte to the Netherlands, emphasizing that the US respects the sovereign prerogatives of its allies. The statement came after Dela Rosa, during a Senate hearing on Duterte’s arrest, suggested that the US government – specifically President Donald Trump – should be informed about the inquiry’s findings. He argued that the Gulfstream G550 aircraft owner falls under the scope of Trump’s executive order that sanctions individuals facilitating the activities of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which he claims interferes with the interests of US allies. Dela Rosa, a staunch Duterte ally and former chief of the Philippine National Police who oversaw the administration’s controversial anti-drug campaign, warned that the aircraft owner should expect “repercussions” under the executive directive. However, Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro countered the senator’s assertion, clarifying that the executive order cited by Dela Rosa does not extend to interfering with decisions made by US allies. Castro underscored that the order explicitly states that Washington honors the sovereign decisions of countries choosing to engage or not engage with the ICC, in accordance with their domestic laws. “If our country and our government decide to cooperate with the Interpol, in accordance with RA 9851, that will not be prevented by the US and the country’s sovereign prerogatives will be respected. So I do not see any possible reason for Senator Bato to run to the US and seek help to freeze the assets of the owner of the aircraft,” she said. Castro also clarified that the Philippines, designated as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally under the American Service-Members’ Protection Act of 2002, is included in the group of countries whose sovereign decisions are acknowledged by the US, as outlined in Trump’s executive order signed in February.",

This comes as the Philippines sees an increase in COVID-19 cases driven by the presence of fast-spreading variants with immune escape characteristics, increased mobility, and waning vaccine immunity. The Philippines logged 1,323 additional COVID-19 cases Sunday, the highest daily rise since February 24. “The president is quite aware and in fact, one of the priorities is managing the effects of this pandemic. So you must also understand that this is so important. They must look very closely and carefully at the candidates,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a press briefing Monday. The names of National Task Force against COVID-19 adviser Ted Herbosa and DOH Technical Advisory Group Edsel Salvana have been floated as possible replacements for Francisco Duque III, former President Rodrigo Duterte's health chief. Cruz-Angeles also said there is no deadline set to complete Marcos’ Cabinet. Marcos also has yet to appoint the next heads of the environment, energy, and science departments. \"I understand [he] is going through the final evaluation stage.

    "date_published": "2024-12-14T13:03:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Funds with no specific allocation in the proposed 2025 national budget remain significant, as the bicameral conference committee earlier this week added another P373 billion to the executive branch's initial proposal. The National Expenditure Program, which outlines the executive branch's proposed budget, initially requested P158.6 billion in what officials call \"unprogrammed funds.\" However, at the bicameral conference of both chambers of Congress, increased this amount by P373 billion, bringing the total to P531.66 billion. Unprogrammed funds are defined by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) as allocations without guaranteed funding.Funds are only allocated for the project when the government secures additional resources or revenues. Under the Marcos administration This is not the first time Congress has approved a higher amount of unprogrammed funds than requested by the Executive branch. In 2024, unprogrammed funds reached a staggering P731.44 billion, making it the second-highest allocation for such items since 2016, surpassed only by the 2023 budget. For 2024, the NEP initially sought P282.9 billion in unprogrammed funds, but Congress increased this by P449.5 billion—a move that drew criticism from opposition lawmakers. Key projects, including major transportation initiatives and military modernization efforts, were unexpectedly placed under unprogrammed funds, surprising some legislators. READ: Unprogrammed funds on the rise: Questions that hound the 2024 budget Senate's perspective In a chance interview on Wednesday, December 12, Senate budget sponsor Sen. Grace Poe commented on the reduced scale of unprogrammed funds for 2025 compared to previous years. “Our unprogrammed funds are not like before when many items were placed under it. Now, it is lower,” Poe said. If approved, 2025 would mark the fourth consecutive year that Congress has increased unprogrammed funds beyond what was requested by the Executive branch. Previous allocations In recent years, Congress has consistently raised unprogrammed fund allocations: For 2022, Congress increased the Executive's request of P151.63 billion to P251.63 billion. For 2023, Congress raised unprogrammed funds to P807.16 billion from the NEP’s original request of P588.162 billion. The DBM has previously explained that categorizing items under unprogrammed funds does not indicate they are low priority. Instead, these projects may lack certain requirements such as complete documentation or finalized loan agreements. Philstar.com has reached out to both DBM and House budget sponsor Ako Bicol Partylist Rep.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Migrant Workers said Friday that is ready to assist Filipinos who will be affected by Kuwait's decision to stop issuing new work and entry visas to Filipinos. In the same release, the DMW said that it has been working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait to address the situation, which, Kuwait Times reported, was prompted by Manila's alleged violations of a 2018 bilateral labor agreement. \"The DMW stands ready to assist our OFWs affected by this action of the Kuwait government,\" it said. \"We urge our affected Kuwait-bound OFWs to connect with us directly through the National Reintegration Center for OFWs (NRCO) hotlines at 09567821309 and 09603532532 or to email nrco@dmw.gov.ph so we may assist them.\" DMW, which had been fielding questions from media about the Kuwaiti government's decision this week, said it had been informed by the DFA of the suspension on issuing visas to Filipinos. \"We shall continue to pursue the track of labor diplomacy in ensuring the welfare and safety of our overseas Filipino workers, while we await more details as to the rationale and issues surrounding the action of the Kuwait government,\" the department said. DMW stopped the deployment of newly-hired domestic workers to Kuwait in February \"until more safeguards are in place for their protection and welfare.\" The deployment ban was prompted by the killing of overseas Filipino worker Jullebee Ranara in Kuwait in January. In a statement earlier Friday, the DFA said it is committed to dialogue with Kuwait to resolve the issue. \"In the case of Kuwait, we are confident that with our friendly relations and strong people-to-people links, we shall be able to find a mutually satisfactory solution that will take into account the need to provide maximum protection and access to justice for all our nationals working in the country,\" it also said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Marikina City took a major step toward becoming a national startup hub with the launch of the Philippine Innovation Hub on Wednesday. Led by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the National Development Co. (NDC), and championed by Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo, the new facility at the Marikina Enterprise Center aims to centralize support for entrepreneurs and realize the vision of a “Marikina Startup Valley.” The hub stems from Quimbo’s long-held vision to address challenges faced by small businesses and creatives. A former shoe entrepreneur, Quimbo sought to unite government, industry and innovation under one roof. “What if we could bring government, industry and innovation under one roof?” she said during the launch, envisioning a space where ideas can thrive and scale. Located in a city once known primarily for shoemaking, the innovation hub offers integrated services including technical assistance, startup incubation, streamlined regulations, digital onboarding and investor matching – all in one place. The goal: help Filipino businesses formalize, innovate and compete globally without leaving Marikina. NDC general manager Saturnino Mejia called the Hub a model of cross-sector collaboration. “What we’re launching here is not just a space – it’s a mission,” Mejia said. “One that’s rooted in shared progress and built for real impact.” The opening of the Hub’s first two floors marks only the beginning, with expansion plans already underway and growing interest from global investors, Quimbo said. The economist-lawmaker noted Marikina’s competitive edge. “Marikina has always had the talent, the creativity, and the grit,” she said. “What we’re building now is the structure that will let that talent lead – not just locally, but globally. This is how we begin the future. This is how we build Marikina Startup Valley.”",

    "date_published": "2024-09-24T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines underscored the importance of a landmark declaration approved by world leaders on Sunday on action guidelines for the international community to resolve global issues. Manila welcomed the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations and hailed them as “triumph of the persistence of multilateralism to affirm that a better world is possible, with the solidarity of nations.” Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said the Pact for the Future “renews collective determination to defuse tensions and seek the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts.” “In pledging to the Pact, states abide by the obligation of rejecting force and the threat of use of force to settle disputes,” Manalo said. Manalo is the head of the Philippine delegation to the Summit of the Future, the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Week and other related meetings from Sept. 22-29 at the UN headquarters in New York. The Summit of the Future, a high-level event, brings world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how to deliver a better world for present and future generations. Under the theme “Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow,” the summit aims to strengthen global cooperation in addressing the most pressing challenges of our time. “The Pact binds us in words and in action, bridging the collective hopes of the past with our contemporary aspirations, with the UN Charter anchoring our will,” he said. The secretary said multilateralism, with the UN at the center, flourishes on the grounds of a rules-based order that provides conditions for trust, solidarity, equity and peace. “Respect for the rule of law safeguards global peace and security and enables the international community to confront complex current and future challenges together,” he stressed. The pact can guide the UN in delivering meaningful outcomes for peace and security, for human rights, for fairness and equality, for resilience from crises and disasters and for empowering individuals and all communities in the world. “As a founding member of the UN and the first Asian republic, the Philippines shall always be a voice for peace, equity and justice, human rights and human dignity, the rule of law and constructive multilateralism,” he added. The Pact along with its annexes, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations, was adopted by consensus, despite a last-minute proposal for an amendment by some countries, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and Syria. The amendment sought to incorporate text calling for non-intervention in any issue of national sovereignty and the primacy of intergovernmental deliberation, in effect, downplaying the role of civil society or private sector interests. It was rejected after the 193-member assembly decided not to act on the proposal. Manalo will deliver the Philippine national statement during the UNGA General Debate and present the Philippines’ advocacies and priorities in line with the agenda of the UN General Assembly’s 79th Session.",

    "date_published": "2023-06-27T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — If the government were its student, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) would give it a “failing grade” for not being able to address critical issues hounding the country’s education sector. Assessing the first year of the Marcos administration, ACT secretary-general Raymond Basilio yesterday said the government failed to prioritize or give urgent action to any of the 10-point challenge issued by teachers and education workers last year. “In his first year in office, we saw Marcos Jr.’s extreme neglect and lack of action to address the crisis in education and economy,” Basilio said in Filipino. “This was matched by the dismissal of the calls from teachers and other sectors by Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, who is more focused on red-tagging as co-vice chair of the NTF-ELCAC,” he added, referring to the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict. Last year, the ACT identified 10 demands to the then incoming administration of Marcos and Duterte. These include doubling the education budget, reopening the schools safely, implementing evidence-based recovery program, providing sufficient learning resources, overhauling the K-12 system and restoring Philippine History in high school and wika (language) and panitikan (literature) in college. The other five demands included upgrading the salary of teachers and education workers, hiring more education support personnel, improving education workers’ benefits, enacting a Magna Carta for private school teachers and upholding academic freedom and union rights. The government has not prioritized the ACT’s first five demands, abandoned the next four and gravely violated the last one, according to the group. While the Department of Education (DepEd) under Duterte pushed for the full reopening of schools last year, the ACT noted the gaps in ensuring the safety of students and teachers. It also repeatedly criticized the government over its failure to address the lack of teachers, non-teaching staff and education facilities. Last January, Duterte presented her Basic Education Report, where she identified key challenges and her agency’s plans for the education sector. Basilio maintained that their assessment of the government has concrete basis, as he noted the lack of budget for the education sector. “It is clear that it was not given priority last year. Teachers and other workers were abandoned, as seen in the lack of action on our call for salary increase, especially with the worsening economic crisis,” he said in Filipino. “The promise made during the elections that the salary of teachers would be increased remains unfulfilled. We also have a record-breaking delay in the release of the 2021 PBB (Performance-Based Bonus) of our teachers. There is no development in the legislation for the Magna Carta for private school teachers,” he added.",

    "date_published": "2023-12-26T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Nine members of the New People’s Army (NPA) were killed in a bloody Christmas Day clash between government forces and the communist rebel group in Bukidnon. Soldiers of the military’s 403rd Infantry Brigade under the 4th Infantry Division also recovered at least eight firearms from the encounter sites in four Malaybalay City villages yesterday. The fatalities are yet to be identified. Government troops are conducting operations against remaining members of the NPA unit operating in the area. Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) public affairs office chief Xerxes Trinidad said soldiers initiated a sustained offensive after receiving reports of NPA presence in the hinterlands of Barangays Can-ayan, Kibalabag, Kulaman and Mapulo. During the initial scouring, operating troops seized eight firearms from the encounter site. They expect to find more as operations continue in coordination with local communities that are also helping identify the casualties. “This incident further diminishes the capability of the NPA to conduct atrocities in Bukidnon and nearby provinces,” Trinidad said. The clash occurred as the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) announced on Sunday that the NPA would observe a unilateral ceasefire on Christmas Day, Dec. 25, and Dec. 26, which falls on the CPP’s 55th founding anniversary. Call to lay down arms Instead of making what it describes as “empty statements,” the military called on remaining members of the NPA to lay down their arms and surrender. “The task given to the AFP is clear and we will comply with it. We will be watchful and our operations will continue unabated to keep our communities safe and end the communist armed conflict, once and for all. The defeat of this threat aligns with the collective wish of all Filipinos,” Trinidad said. “The unilateral ceasefire declared by the CPP is an empty statement as they do not have the leadership and support of the masses. Their ammunitions are depleted and their members – supporters included – are surrendering,” he added. Trinidad assured the public that the AFP will keep watch despite the truce. “Their capability to plan and stage attacks was already diminished, but we are expecting harassments to create unnecessary disturbance or noise. Nonetheless, our forces on the ground were already warned and are ready,” he said. “It is much better for them to abandon the armed struggle. Laying down their arms and returning to the fold of the law in order to be with their families is the rational path forward towards a united, peaceful and progressive country,” Trinidad said. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr., in an interview over ANC Sunday night, clarified that formal peace talks with the CPP-NPA have not yet resumed. Only exploratory talks are ongoing. “I think it was underemphasized that these are not peace talks,” he stressed, explaining that peace talks are “a hurdle which we have not crossed.” Teodoro stressed that if formal peace talks resumed, there would be a cessation of law enforcement operations against the CPP-NPA-National Democratic Front, and a cessation of activities of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict.",

Guevarra explained that the alleged crime was committed in Indonesia where Veloso was tried, convicted and sentenced by the court. “So only the president of Indonesia can grant her executive clemency as an act of sovereign grace,” Guevarra said. However, he said the granting of clemency by Marcos is not “impossible.” “Theoretically, PBBM cannot, but it is not impossible if such grant of executive clemency be agreed upon by the two heads of state,” Guevarra said in a message to Philstar.com. On Wednesday, November 20, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that Veloso is finally returning home to the Philippines after 14 years of incarceration in Indonesia due to a conviction on drug charges. However, Marcos did not specify the exact date of Veloso’s return. It is also unclear what would be Veloso's status upon her return to the country — whether she's a free woman or still a person in custody. \"I extend my heartfelt gratitude to President Prabowo Subianto and the Indonesian government for their goodwill. This outcome is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia—united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion,\" Marcos’ statement read. \"We look forward to welcoming Mary Jane home,\" he added. Veloso was arrested in 2010 on charges of drug trafficking. In 2015, former President Benigno Aquino III made a last-minute appeal to Indonesia to spare Veloso’s life after her illegal recruiter surrendered to authorities in the Philippines. Veloso was scheduled to be executed by firing squad in the early hours of April 29, 2015. The reprieve was granted so close to the time set that some print media mistakenly reported her execution. What is an executive clemency Executive clemency is a power granted to the president of the Philippines by the Constitution. It is provided under Article VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which provides: \"Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment. He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.\" However, the president cannot grant clemencies in cases of election offenses or impeachment. Clemency should only be granted after a conviction of a final judgment, except in the case of amnesty, which can be applied to individuals yet to be convicted. 4 People Reacted How Do You Feel About This Article?

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — All 17 local government units of Metro Manila will soon enforce ordinances regulating the use of electric vehicles and imposing fines on offenders. The Metro Manila Council (MMC), composed of the mayors of the 17 Metro Manila LGUs, and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) came up with a resolution containing rules that would govern the use of e-bicycles, e-tricycles, kuliglig and e-scooters. The MMC and MMDA will require users of e-vehicles to secure a driver’s license, according to acting MMDA Chairman Romando Artes. Under MMDA Regulation No. 24-022 series of 2024, the agency banned e-vehicles along major roads under its watch, particularly circumferential roads such as Recto Avenue or C-1, Quirino Avenue or C-2, Araneta Avenue or C-3, EDSA or C-5, Katipunan Avenue and C. P. Garcia Avenue or C-5 and Southeast Metro Manila Expressway or C-6. E-vehicles will also be prohibited along radial roads like Roxas Boulevard or R-1, Taft Avenue or R-2, South Superhighway or R-3, Shaw Boulevard or R-4, Ortigas Avenue or R-5, Magsaysay Boulevard and Aurora Boulevard or R-6, Quezon Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue or R-7, A. Bonifacio Avenue or R-8, Rizal Avenue or R-9, and Del Pan/Marcos Highway/MacArthur Highway or collectively R-10. The ban also covers Elliptical Road, Mindanao Avenue and Marcos Highway, the MMDA added. The MMDA would impose a P2,500 on e-vehicle users caught traversing these roads and impound the vehicles, Artes declared. Meanwhile, San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora – also MMC president – said each of the 17 Metro Manila LGUs would pass their respective ordinances tackling similar prohibitions, as well as identifying more roads in their respective areas covered by the ban. Artes pointed out that the rules may become effective by April this year as they have to be studied by the Land Transportation Office.",

    "date_published": "2022-10-25T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos should be given enough time to continue the campaign against illegal drugs, including the possibility of reinstating the death penalty for drug traffickers and other heinous criminals, Sen. Bong Go said. Go lauded Marcos for continuing former president Rodrigo Duterte’s fight against illegal drugs, one of the priority programs of the previous administration. “I am happy because President Marcos mentioned the fight against illegal drugs. He has his own method and style in fighting illegal drugs,” said Go in Filipino. “And I have confidence in him, let’s give him enough time...” He expressed belief that if authorities will not check the situation, the sale and use of illegal drugs will again become rampant and breed criminality and corruption in government. Go emphasized the need to intensify efforts to fight these social ills by reiterating the link between drugs, crime and corruption. “When you are on drugs, it can lead to corruption and criminality. Ordinary citizens cannot walk at night for fear of getting victimized by drug addicts. Criminals should be the ones afraid to walk at night, not the ordinary Filipino who just wants to live a quiet life and their children can go home without being hurt or molested,” he said. Citing his continuing advocacy of promoting sports as a way to combat said social ills in the country, the senator then encouraged Filipinos to get into sports and stay away from drugs. “We should give the youth other things to do. Remember that when you are into sports, your body is better, you are able to exercise, you are able to play, you are sweating... But with illegal drugs, your body is already damaged, your brain will be damaged,” he added. At the same time, Go also expressed support for reimposition of the death penalty, especially for those involved in illegal drugs and plunder. The vice chair of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs expressed his support for proposals to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes related to illegal drugs and plunder. Go mentioned that he had earlier submitted a bill to reinstate the death penalty during the 18th Congress. “When I became a senator, I also filed another version (of the death penalty). There are many versions of the death penalty, especially for illegal drugs,” said Go. “So, I agree with the death penalty on illegal drugs, it depends on the quantity… You know, when you become a victim of illegal drugs, it’s gone, you’re addicted. This drug becomes addictive and your fear will disappear.” In previous interviews Go has expressed willingness to refile the death penalty measure. The senator emphasized that the reinstatement of death penalty is in line with Duterte’s crusade against illegal drugs, criminality and corruption. He added that the imposition of capital punishment can discourage criminal activities. “There must be fear. One method is death penalty. Why should you be afraid of the death penalty if you are not guilty, if you obey the law. You have nothing to fear,” he said.",

    "article_body": "The British Chamber of Commerce Philippines (BCCP) remains concerned of the reported delay of quota distribution to meat importers–noting it may cause inflationary pressures in the country which echoed the sentiments of the Meat Importers & Traders Association (MITA), in a letter addressed to Department of Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. yesterday. BCCP Executive Director/Trustee Chris Nelson emphasized how it may impact supply, existing trade agreements, and may undermine the efforts to fight inflation–citing the consistent efforts of BCCP and the significance of the recent signing of the Executive Order No. 50 which warranted the extension of lowered tariffs for pork due to present economic condition of the country. In a recent interview: “We are very strong supporters of the extension of the Executive Order [50], we believe strongly that allowing pork to come at lowered tariff rates is a help for inflation and food security. In that context, we would not wish to see a suspension of MAV. As we’ve discussed on previous programs, pork supply has been impacted locally due to African Swine Fever and there’s definitely a need to further continue pork imports.” Based on the report, a provisional minimum access volume import certificate (MAVIC) would be issued to licensees with only 25% of the tentative annual allocation for the pork MAV. The British Chamber further noted that it welcomes any inputs and dialogue with the Department of Agriculture, and other relevant parties to avoid concerns which may lead to the disruption in the supply chain, food security, and inflation. Previously, the British Chamber also expressed its concerns on the reported suspension of MAV for pork imports that may impact inflation and food security–taking into account the challenge facing the African Swine Fever (ASF), which remains to be active in 8 regions, 12 provinces, 28 municipalities and 122 barangays, as reported by the Bureau of Animal Industry. Meanwhile, the British Chamber consistently advocated for the extension of lowered tariffs under and urged the passage of the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act–further improving the agricultural sector while aiming to safeguard the local farmers and consumers against unfair market practices and support local industries. “We hereby acknowledge the role of agriculture in the Philippine economic growth and we look forward to the Bicameral Conference and therefore, the passage of the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act.” The British Chamber has consistently advocated and reaffirmed the UK-PH trade–with the latter being the 2nd largest pork export market in Asia, further improving the domestic market by introducing quality and safe British meat to their local counterparts, contributing to the overall bilateral trade.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — As the risks linked to climate change continue to increase, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Thursday that his administration will tackle the crisis by working with the international community. “We will look to our partners and friends to help the Philippines who, despite having very small carbon footprints, is at the highest risk,” Marcos said in his inaugural speech. “First, spare victims then help them recover and move on to lessen the harmful impact of climate change,” he added. The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts such as strong cyclones, flooding, and sea level rise. “The rich world talks a great deal but does a lot less about it (climate change) than those with much less, but have suffered more death and destruction from climate change and lack of adaptation,” Marcos said. Climate finance Climate Reality Project Philippines manager Nazrin Castro told Philstar.com that the organization is hoping that Marcos will bring the responsibility of the developed world to climate-vulnerable countries to climate change negotiations. Castro urged Marcos to demand wealthy nations to deliver their commitment to mobilize $100 billion annually in climate finance, and ensure the Philippines will have a voice in the COP27 climate talks on the establishment of the loss and damage financing facility for developing countries. Marcos is invited to attend COP27 in Egypt this November. In its first Nationally Determined Contribution, the Philippines committed to slash its carbon emissions by 75% by 2030 from sectors of agriculture, waste, industry, transport, and energy. However, a bulk of this commitment is hinged on foreign funding and assistance. Marcos also stressed that the Philippines has to play its part in addressing plastic pollution. The Philippines is among the top contributors to the marine plastic crisis. “We won’t shirk from that responsibility, we will clean up.” Energy transition Marcos mentioned in his speech that there are “tried and proven ways of mitigation” as he once again took credit for the wind farm in Bangui, Ilocos Norte, claiming he built it. He did not. The wind farm is a project of Ayala-owned North Wind Power Development Corp. He also hinted at tapping oil and gas as the prices of gas and diesel continue to rise. “But surely, a free world awash with oil can assure supplies or we will find a way. We are not far from oil and gas reserves that have already been developed,” Marcos said. The Philippines is scaling up the development of infrastructures that will support the import of liquefied natural gas in anticipation of the depletion of the Malampaya deep water gas-to-power project in Palawan. But groups like the Center for Energy, Ecology, and Development warn that this blocks the transition to cleaner and cheaper renewable energy. “We, however, lament his position on fossil fuels and his failure to mention the critical role of renewable energy in addressing our issues on energy, specifically reliability, affordability, and security,” Castro said. “At this point, the clean energy transition must be pursued because it makes good economic sense. The climate change mitigation factor is just a co-benefit,” she added. Be The First To React How Do You Feel About This Article?

    "article_body": "To achieve high, sustainable growth MANILA, Philippines — The government will need to quickly address issues in infrastructure to achieve high and sustainable growth, according to think tank GlobalSource Partners. “Sound infrastructure is one big challenge to the Philippines’ bid for high and sustainable economic growth. Unless the issue of infrastructure is decisively and quickly addressed, it may instead drag the momentum of growth down,” GlobalSource Partners country analysts Diwa Guinigundo and Wilhelmina Manalac said. They said the new infrastructure projects approved recently by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board chaired by President Marcos could simply lengthen the government’s list of infrastructure deliverables. New projects approved by the NEDA Board earlier this month are the Facility for Accelerating Studies for Infrastructure Project (FAST-Infra Project) and the Infrastructure for Safer and Resilient Schools (ISRS) Project. With a project cost of P2.75 billion, the FAST-Infra Project aims to develop a robust transportation infrastructure investment program in line with the Philippines’ sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, the ISRS would involve the repair, rehabilitation, retrofitting and reconstruction of schools destroyed by natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes. Also approved earlier this month were extension of the implementation period and loan validity of the Support for Parcelization of Lands for Individual Titling Project, as well as the extension of implementation period of the LRT Line 2 East extension project. While the approval and completion of these key infrastructure projects would lead to more efficient production and distribution of goods, as well as encourage more foreign investments into the country, Guinigundo and Manalac cited the pace at which projects are being completed. Of the 13 projects aimed at establishing physical connectivity, water resources, digital connectivity and health, the NEDA reported as of end-November 2023 that only one was completed last year in the Visayas. All the other 12 will be completed this year. “With the new projects, and many others still to be completed, the list of flagship projects continues to lengthen; the likelihood of everything being completed becomes uncertain,” Guinigundo and Manalac said. There are 185 infrastructure flagship projects (IFPs) worth over P9 trillion under the government’s list of priority projects. As priority projects, the IFPs will be provided the necessary support for efficient and faster implementation. The government is aiming to achieve six to seven percent economic growth this year. In the first quarter, the economy expanded by 5.7 percent, slower than the 6.4 percent growth in the same quarter in 2023, but faster than the 5.5 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

The DTI earlier appealed to e-commerce platforms to police their sellers, and ensure there are appropriate age verification mechanisms and graphic health warnings in all listed products. For its part, the health department said it continues to inform the public about the health risks of vaping through community-level efforts to promote and establish smoke-free and vape-free environments and through social media campaigns. It also issued and is implementing graphic health warnings for vapor products to raise awareness on the adverse effects of vaping. “Lastly, we encourage our provincial and local governments to implement our smoke-free and vape-free playbooks, such that we are enabled to live in a healthier environment,” the DOH said. The Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act lapsed into law in July 2022. The DTI issued the law’s implementing rules and regulations in December 2022. The law allows individuals as young as 18 years old to purchase vaping products, prompting criticisms from health and child rights organizations that it will bring e-cigarettes closer to young people. — with report from The STAR/Catherine Talavera Be The First To React How Do You Feel About This Article?

    "article_headline": "3 partylists seek probe on PUV modernization",
    "date_published": "2023-03-13T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — Kabataan Party-list has filed Resolution 816 to urge the House Committee on Transportation to investigate, in aid of legislation, the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program of the Department of Transportation. The resolution said that many operators continue to avoid entering into the PUVMP due to high cost to change their vehicles, besides the possibility of losing their livelihood once they enter the franchise consolidation. It said that under this program, jeepney operators and drivers are being compelled to purchase modern jeepneys or mini buses worth at least P2.4 million each through loans from financial institutions. Greg Perez, president of Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide (PISTON)-Cebu, said this is precisely the reason why they are against the modernization program as small-time cooperatives cannot afford the high cost of the modernized unit, considering that the government subsidy for each unit is only P160,000. Although PISTON-Cebu did not join the nationwide strike initiated by their counterpart in Metro Manila last March 6, 2023, Perez said they support the call of the latter and several transport groups in Metro Manila in scrapping the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Memorandum Circular No. 2023-013 that was issued on February 20, 2023. MC No. 2023-013 states that individual operators of traditional jeepneys will no longer be allowed to continue their operations after June 30, 2023 unless they start joining a cooperative or a corporation. The LTFRB, on the other hand, has already extended the deadline from June 30, 2023 to the end of December 2023. However, only those individual operators who are able to join an existing consolidated entity on or before June 30, 2023 shall be allowed to have their provisional authority extended until the end of the year. According to the authors of the said resolution, the program, in the guise of modernization, is simply a corporate takeover of the PUJ sector that would not only result to massive loss of livelihood of the transport workers, but also would severely affect the public since PUJ is still the most used mode of public transport system. The authors are Representatives Raoul Danniel Manuel of Kabataan PL, France Castro of ACT Teachers PL, and Arlene Brosas of Gabriela Women’s Party. The resolution also states that traditional cooperatives only control or own the franchise, and jeepneys can still be owned by the operators but consolidation requires the operators to surrender to the ownership of the cooperative or corporation the franchise and the unit itself. The DOTr and the LTFRB implemented in June 2017 the PUVMP which aims to phase out all jeepneys that are 15 years old and older as a mode of transportation through DOTr Department Order 2018-011, also known as the Omnibus Guidelines on the Planning and Identification of Public Road Transportation Services and Franchise Issuance or simply known as the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines. These traditional jeepneys are then replaced with brand new ones or the modern jeepneys powered by an electric powertrain or at least a Euro 4 compliant diesel engine to conform Philippine National Standards. — GMR (FREEMAN)",

Pasang Masda, Busina, Altodap, ACTO, Stop & Go, UV Express and LTOP held a rally over the weekend to support Guadiz after a former LTFRB employee said that at least P5 million was being paid in exchange for the approval of franchise or securing routes and special permits from the agency. Jeff Tumbado, the former head executive assistant of Guadiz, has since rescinded his statement even as he alleged that corruption could have reached the Department of Transportation and Malacañang.

    "date_published": "2024-07-24T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "Despite extreme weather conditions MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) remains optimistic it will hit its target of expanding local farm and fisheries output by one to two percent this year amid extreme weather conditions. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the expansion in farm areas brought about by new irrigation systems nationwide, both traditional and solar-powered, would contribute to higher agricultural output this year. Nonetheless, Tiu Laurel noted that hitting their production targets would not be “too easy” given the challenges brought about by climatic conditions at the onset of the year. He cited the presence of El Niño in the first half as one of the major production challenges this year and the expected La Niña phenomenon this second half. Farmers and fisherfolk incurred losses amounting to almost P10 billion this year due to hotter and dryer weather conditions brought about by El Niño. “We are hopeful, barring strong typhoons, we will post higher (agricultural)] production,” Tiu Laurel said during the government’s post-SONA briefing yesterday. The agriculture chief is also banking on the efficacy of an African swine fever vaccine set to be tested by the government to finally control or put an end to the devastation being caused by the fatal disease on local pig production. The DA earlier maintained its palay production target of 20.4 million metric tons for the year. The agriculture and fisheries sector grew by 0.4 percent in 2023, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The value of local agriculture and fisheries output in the first quarter remained relatively flat as subsectors reeled from the El Niño phenomenon, with poultry being the lone subsector posting higher production. The PSA said the value of agriculture and fisheries production at constant 2018 prices reached P428.99 billion, about P200 million higher than the P428.79 billion in the same quarter in 2023. The PSA said the value of production of crops, livestock and fisheries subsectors all contracted, but the poultry subsector registered an increase. In an earlier interview, Tiu Laurel said he was “cautiously” optimistic that the agriculture and fisheries sector would perform better in the second quarter as a result of the various interventions that the government made against El Niño. Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa earlier said the overall performance of the agriculture and fisheries sector would have contracted if the government had not rolled out its mitigating measures against El Niño.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Once motorcycles can be legally recognized as taxis, the government plans to organize motorcycle taxi drivers into cooperatives that can establish their own ride-hailing platform, chief of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said. LTFRB chief Teofilo Guadiz III presented before a House panel on Tuesday the initial findings of the four-year pilot study on motorcycle taxis, part of which included recommendations on how to improve the income and benefits of motorcycle taxi drivers. Guadiz said that once a law is enacted to include motorcycles as public utility vehicles, the Office of Transportation Cooperatives under the Department of Transportation can allow riders to organize as transport cooperatives. “In the future, transport cooperatives may apply to be accredited TNCs that will have their own platform,” Guadiz said during his presentation. The pilot study is still ongoing, according to the LTFRB chief, but its initial findings suggest that full-time motorcycle riders can earn as much as P40,000 monthly, based on estimates provided by ride-hailing app Angkas. Guadiz added that another recommendation by the motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) is to help cooperatives access loaning facilities and avail of government benefits such as the Social Security System, Philhealth and Pag-ibig. Another recommendation by the TWG is to explore additional passive income for riders, such as providing them “interest on share capital” as well as “patronage refund. “In the event that RA 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code) is amended to include Motorcycles as Public Utility Vehicles, the OTC sees this as an opening to deliver its mandate to a wider array of stakeholders,” Guadiz said. “The Office is ready and more than willing to cater the motorcycle taxi sector and push its development which will be beneficial to our transport system as a whole,” he added. The TWG’s initial findings are based on a survey of 1,524 motorcycle taxi riders from three major ride-hailing platforms: Angkas, Joyride and MoveIt. These motorcycle-hailing apps are currently allowed to operate on a provisional authority with a total cap of 45,000 participants in the study. The motorcycle taxi study was initiated by the DOTr in 2019 to evaluate the safety of motorcycles-for-hire in ride-hailing platforms. The study also aimed to give the government enough time to thresh out legal issues concerning the use of motorcycles as a mode of public transport as the current Land Transportation and Traffic Code prohibits the use of private motorcycles for hire. Drivers working for ride-hailing platforms and transportation network companies are considered independent contractors who shoulder their own fuel costs and vehicle maintenance. While they have to remit their own government benefits, motorcycle taxi drivers of Angkas get accident insurance and medical reimbursement insurance, according to the study.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — International testing, inspection and certification provider SGS has offered to inspect imported agricultural products to the Philippines to help monitor leakages in trade, according to Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion. In a statement yesterday, Concepcion said he had a meeting with SGS vice president and regional operations manager (Asia) George Bottomley last March 31, when the latter discussed how the SGS system can help monitor leakages in trade and provide data analysis to increase trade revenues and opportunities for the Philippines. The Geneva-based SGS operates locally as SGS Philippines and has offices and laboratories across the country. Globally, the company has 97,000 employees in 2,650 offices and laboratories worldwide. Concepcion said SGS offered to inspect imported agricultural products to the Philippines at no cost to the government. He explained that the company plans on charging its fees to the exporters of agricultural products to the Philippines. “SGS’ offer is to inspect all agricultural products coming into the Philippines, and it will now be the exporters who will have to pay to send their agricultural products here,” Concepcion said. “The issue on agricultural smuggling is real, and I think any effort to help curb it is worth looking into,” he added. According to Go Negosyo, Bottomley emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and quality of agricultural products in the country, as well as how SGS can assist farmers and agribusinesses by providing testing and certification services. He also affirmed the commitment of SGS to promote sustainable agriculture practices through its programs and initiatives. Concepcion said the proposal of SGS will be referred to the relevant public and private sector bodies, such as the Department of Agriculture and the Private Sector Advisory Council for agriculture. He emphasized that eradicating smuggling and undervaluation of agricultural goods complements efforts to help strengthen local agriculture. “It comes just in time as more companies have become interested in joining our KALAP initiative,” Concepcion said, referring to Go Negosyo’s Kapatid Angat Lahat Agri Program. Just recently, the country’s leading banks and financial institutions met with KALAP and expressed their support for its efforts to ease farmers’ access to credit. KALAP is an initiative of Go Negosyo to help the country’s small farmers integrate into the value chain of large companies. Its proponents have begun drafting its roadmap to implement inclusive business models for primary agricultural commodities in the country.",

In a statement on Tuesday, Concepcion said several expansion and export opportunities in Cambodia for Philippine companies were explored during the CEO Roundtable meeting held on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh last week. He added that the meeting was able to identify areas of cooperation in agriculture, housing, digitalization, food security, hospitality, garments manufacturing, business process outsourcing and with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) development as among the priority areas. The Go Negosyo founder noted that agriculture, in particular, was revealed as a promising area of cooperation between the two countries. He pointed out that Cambodia produces rice, but Vietnam – a major exporter of rice to the Philippines – has the biggest production by hectare. “Cambodia is a big exporter of rice, but it goes through Vietnam for processing,” Concepcion said. “Our suggestion is to import so that the Philippine companies can process the rice,” he added. Concepcion said Cambodian businessmen were receptive to the idea, and even offered technology exchange between the two countries. The CEO Roundtable meeting was the first engagement of President Marcos during the ASEAN Summits. The private meeting was attended by Cambodian and Philippine business leaders to connect and discuss opportunities for business exchange between the two economies. Also at the meeting were Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s George Barcelon, LT Group’s Michael Tan, Go Negosyo senior adviser Josephine Romero and the Philippine winners of the ASEAN Business Awards 2022. During the meeting, the Philippine group invited Cambodian businessmen to invest in the Philippines and partner with Philippine businesses. Several opportunities for business exchange emerged for both big and small businesses. MSMEs from the Philippines – FELTA Multimedia, Home Healthlink and Esquire Financing – who were also winners of the ASEAN Business Awards, said they are looking for partners to expand both in the Philippines and within ASEAN.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health reported Thursday 28 new injuries due to stray bullets and fireworks during the New Year festivities. The additional cases brought the tally of injuries to 585, mostly due to fireworks. Of the total, there was one case of watusi ingestion and three stray bullet injuries. The two new cases of stray bullet injuries involved a 28-year-old male from Metro Manila who sustained a fracture in his toe, and a 60-year-old male from the Cordillera Administrative Region who suffered a fractured left collarbone. “Let us be reminded that injuries and deaths from stray bullets and “accidents” due to intoxication are avoidable. Guns, fireworks, and liquor should not mix,” the DOH said. According to the department, more than half, or 311, of injuries related to New Year festivities were from Metro Manila. The capital region was followed by Ilocos region (58), Calabarzon (47), and Central Luzon (42). Ninety-six percent of the injuries happened at home and on the streets, mostly by males who actively lit the fireworks. The most common culprits were kwitis, 5-star, whistle bomb, pla-pla, boga, luces, and foundation. “Illegal fireworks are to blame for just four out of 10 cases (220, 38%), with legal fireworks causing more injuries,” the DOH said.",

    "date_published": "2024-12-03T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus 3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) has cut its growth forecast for the Philippines to 5.8 percent for this year, but expects the economy to post faster growth next year, citing easing inflation and interest rates. In a statement yesterday, AMRO said it expects the Philippines to post gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.8 percent this year, lower than the 6.1 percent economic growth forecast provided by AMRO last October. AMRO’s new 2024 GDP forecast for the Philippines is also below the government’s six to seven percent growth goal for the year. For 2025, AMRO expects economic growth to accelerate to 6.3 percent. This forecast is also lower than the 6.5 to 7.5 percent growth the government is aiming for in 2025. “The Philippine economy is expected to strengthen further with easing inflation and a less restrictive monetary policy,” AMRO said. AMRO said it expects inflation to fall to 3.2 percent this year and to remain at this level in 2025 from last year’s six percent. Inflation accelerated to 2.3 percent in October from 1.9 percent in September amid faster upticks in food prices. This brought average inflation from January to October to 3.3 percent, within the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)’s two to four percent target band. The BSP delivered its first rate cut in August, followed by another 25-basis-point rate reduction in October, bringing the benchmark rate to six percent. Aside from slower inflation and lower interest rates, AMRO expects Philippine GDP growth to be supported by strong domestic demand and a pickup in external demand. Philippine economic growth slowed to 5.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter’s 6.4-percent expansion and the six percent growth posted in the third quarter last year. From January to September, the economy grew by an average of 5.8 percent. Earlier, National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the economy needs to grow by at least 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter to attain the six to seven percent growth goal for the year. The AMRO said risks to the country’s growth prospects include higher inflation that could dampen consumption, as well as a sharp slowdown in major trading partners. It said heightened geopolitical risks could also lead to supply disruptions and a resurgence of inflationary pressure. “The country’s long-term potential growth could be challenged by insufficient infrastructure investment, vulnerabilities to climate change and the prolonged scarring effects from the COVID-19 pandemic,” the AMRO said. To bolster the Philippines’ potential growth, AMRO recommends the implementation of measures to upskill and reskill the workforce and attract foreign direct investments, while encouraging technology transfer. “To lift growth potential, it is important to develop a comprehensive strategy to enhance productivity and competitiveness. This includes further infrastructure investment and continued development in digitalization as well as promoting a sustainable economy,” AMRO said.",

    "date_published": "2023-08-08T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — In an effort to address vaccine hesitancy among the public, the Department of Health (DOH) has advised local officials to engage “influencers” in their campaign so as to convince unvaccinated members of the community to receive COVID-19 vaccines. In a recently released memorandum, the DOH said local officials should “ensure the presence of key influencers/champions in the barangay, highlighting the benefits of vaccination through the influencers’ testimonies.” An influencer is someone who is able to persuade a lot of other people or a target audience, according to a definition by Collins Dictionary. Influencers have the capability to convince individuals or groups into doing something. The DOH also recommended that local government units (LGUs) employ “small group discussions as these provide more personal messaging to address personal concerns.” “Coordinate with local leaders and community health workers to identify vaccine-hesitant individuals, and explore and address specific reasons behind the hesitation,” the agency’s memorandum instructed. The DOH recently announced that bivalent COVID-19 vaccines can now be given as first, second and third booster to the country’s priority groups – health care workers (A1), senior citizens (A2) and immunocompromised individuals (A3). Health Secretary Ted Herbosa said they decided to roll out these bivalent jabs to the A3 category to speed up the utilization of the 390,000 doses of the vaccines, which are set to expire on Aug. 30. The DOH stressed that to fast-track the COVID-19 vaccination program, LGUs should ensure placement of vaccination sites at strategic locations. The agency likewise noted a need to focus on the deployment of more vaccination teams to identified areas, including volunteers from medical societies, civil society organizations, private sectors and faith-based organizations. “Form more vaccination teams for mobile vaccination and temporary post-vaccination, as needed. Provide daily quota per vaccination team based on the target per barangay or catchment area,” the DOH said.",

According to a report of the Philippine Statistics Authority on Wednesday, agriculture and fisheries production have shrunk by -0.3%. Livestock and poultry production, meanwhile, grew at 2.5% and 2.9% in the third quarter, respectively, helping offset the 0.4% and 6.1% contraction in crops and fisheries production. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) stated that it was ready to implement additional policy measures as needed to stabilize inflation expectations due to a significant upside risk to its inflation forecast until 2025. On October 26, the BSP had recently raised interest rates by 25 basis points outside the regular schedule expressing concerns about the potential for uncontrolled inflation. The year-to-date average inflation of 6.4% continued to exceed the central bank's comfortable range of 2% to 4%. The BSP also reported that 2.26 million Filipinos were unemployed in September which is higher than August’s 2.21 million. Be The First To React How Do You Feel About This Article?

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Impeachment complaints filed against Vice President Sara Duterte will likely get the support or one-third of the House of Representatives, according to Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. “But we don’t know if it will succeed in the Senate,” Abante told Teleradyo Serbisyo. Congressmen are still “blind” to the impeachment process against Duterte “because nobody is moving,” he said. “There is no movement although three impeachment complaints have already been filed,” he said. Duterte’s impeachment might proceed depending on the actions of congressmen, some of whom were still on vacation as of yesterday, he noted. Only one-third of House members are needed for a resolution to get approved and set into motion the articles of impeachment, according to Abante, vice chairman of House committee on good government and public accountability. He admitted the campaign period for the mid-term elections might set back impeachment proceedings. Congressmen do not want to fast track the impeachment process so that it can stand once it is forwarded to the Senate, he said. Consolidation of the impeachment complaints filed by members of the Akbayan, Makabayan and a group of lawyers and priests will depend on the House justice committee’s decision. Abante also sees no problem with former president Rodrigo Duterte acting as a lawyer for his daughter in the impeachment complaints filed against her. The House quad committee, he stressed, will continue probing Philippine offshore gaming operators and extrajudicial killings during the previous Duterte administration. The quad committee, composed of four House panels, earlier recommended the filing of crimes against humanity charges against Duterte, Senators Bong Go and Ronald Dela Rosa and other police officials for reported extrajudicial killings during Duterte’s term. “Next to that is asking victims’ relatives to show up. This is not only about the war on drugs. This includes even those so-called human rights defenders who do not have any involvement in the armed struggle. They are also complaining because they are not NPA (New People’s Army), they were just mistakenly included,” Abante said. Many members of the media, lawyers and doctors were also killed during the Duterte administration, he Abante said. “They were killed. They claimed they are carrying firearms, when in fact, they don’t have. They are not even members of the CPP (Communist Party of the Philippines)-NPA,” he said. The quad comm, led by Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, also wants to probe the death of Albuera, Leyte mayor Rolando Espinosa, Abante said. Espinosa was killed inside his cell at the Baybay City provincial jail on Nov. 5, 2016. He was among the politicians linked by Duterte to the illegal drug trade.",

The department is eyeing to repatriate all 114 individuals by the second week of August. \"The DFA continues to assist all distressed Filipinos overseas, including undocumented contract workers,\" Foreign Affairs Acting Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said in a statement on Sunday. The first batch of Filipinos reportedly arrived on Saturday. Officials from the department’s Office of the Undersecretary for Migrant Workers' Affairs (OUMWA) welcomed six female individuals, two males, and five minors when they arrived in Manila. Sri Lanka is facing an economic crisis with reports of food, fuel, and medicine shortages going on for months.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To restore people’s confidence in the Commission on Elections (Comelec), President Marcos was asked yesterday to appoint two new poll commissioners from the opposition. Veteran election lawyer Romulo Macalintal stressed the “urgent need” to appoint commissioners nominated by opposition parties following the recent Supreme Court rulings against the Comelec. Macalintal said the current Comelec has repeatedly committed grave abusive acts by failing to observe the basic constitutional rights to due process and equal protection laws. “Thus, because of this development, we cannot blame the stakeholders in the forthcoming 2025 elections to feel wary, especially the candidates and the law profession, of the independence, integrity, and competence of the officials who will conduct the said elections,” Macalintal said in a statement. He said the people must be fully informed of why and how much alleged abusive acts are committed by the Comelec in rendering decisions. “And this could only be done and insured with a Comelec commissioner recommended by the opposition who could be their voice to be insured of an independent and impartial Comelec,” he added. In 1984, Macalintal said, the late former president Ferdinand Marcos Sr. appointed congressman Ramon Felipe as poll commissioner as recommended by the opposition. Felipe eventually became Comelec chief after the 1986 revolution. Macalintal said there are many young and competent practicing election lawyers who could be appointed as poll commissioners and decide cases with integrity and honesty. Comelec Commissioners Socorro Inting and Marlon Casquejo are set to retire this week.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health (DOH) yesterday clarified that not all of the P7.4 billion worth of drugs tagged by the Commission on Audit (COA) have expired. “Only 0.03 percent were found to have actually expired while only 1.16 percent are near expiry,” the DOH reported. Most of the expired medicines, DOH said, are stocks in government-run hospitals, which were unutilized due to the lower number of patients going to hospitals fearing COVID-19, while the rest were in DOH regional offices, which remained undistributed due to refusal to accept new stocks, citing sufficiency of existing inventory. The DOH explained that the COA findings focused on the proper disposal of expired drugs and medicines and not on expiration per se, noting that the concerned hospitals and health facilities were able to justify the causes of the expiration, but those were not highlighted in the audit. Some 95.81 percent of the cited amount is not expired and only pertains to slow moving, undistributed or overstocked inventories, the DOH said. Concerning the slow-moving inventories, DOH said that 86 percent have been distributed to centers for health development and other health facilities. The remaining 14 percent of the inventories tagged as slow-moving/undistributed/overstocked are scheduled to be delivered in the last quarter of 2023. Health Secretary Ted Herbosa previously ordered the creation of an asset management task force in the DOH to ensure that issues like these are planned for, immediately addressed and prevented. Bivalent doses Over 13,000 doses of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines are still available for eligible population, the DOH said. As of Sept. 8, DOH said, a total of 13,394 bivalent doses are yet to be used. About half of the remaining doses are allocated in the Bicol region (2,607), Calabarzon (2,354) and Mimaropa (2,223). The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao still has 1,630 doses while the National Capital Region has 1,137. Of the 388,980 bivalent vaccines donated by the Lithuanian government, 366,561 doses have been used. “(This) accounts for 94.23 percent of the allocated vaccines from the Lithuanian government,” the DOH noted.",

It is high time we recognize their contributions to building resilient communities,” Gatchalian said, referring to the Department of Social Welfare and Development.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To monitor and track sex offenders in the community, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada is proposing the establishment of a national database of sex offenders that is easily available and accessible to local law enforcement agencies and their foreign counterparts. “The many special penal laws against sex-related offenses so enacted of late shall be futile unless ample public protection and warning is provided for,” Estrada said in explaining the necessity of Senate Bill 1291, the proposed “National Sex Offender Registry Act.” It is unfortunate, he said, that a number of sex offenders who have been apprehended and convicted are still able to consummate their fiendish schemes against unsuspecting victims by relocating elsewhere. Estrada explained that the measure aims to establish a national sex offender registration database that may be of use not only to the general public but also to various non-government organizations working for the protection of women and children who more often than not are the target victims of sex-related offenses. The National Sex Offender Registry Database proposed to be set up and handled by the Department of Justice (DOJ) shall contain the names and other pertinent details of sex offenders who reside or travel to the country. It will be available and accessible to the Philippine National Police (PNP), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and concerned law enforcement agencies. It can be shared between countries and respective law enforcement agencies if deemed necessary for the proper registration and identification of sex offenders. Under the bill, convicted sex offenders, prior to being released from imprisonment, shall register and regularly update the province, city, or municipality where they are residing, employed, or studying. They have 10 days to update their registration if there are changes in their address, employment, or school. Failure to do so will be penalized with one to five years of imprisonment and fined P10,000. Those convicted in local and foreign courts shall remain in the registry for life and will be required to appear at least once a year before the local police in their place of residence to personally verify their information.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Murder charges have been filed against expelled congressman Arnolfo Teves Jr. over the March 4 assassination of Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). State prosecutors filed charges of murder, frustrated murder and attempted murder against Teves before a Manila court on Aug. 18, DOJ spokesman Mico Clavano said at a forum over the weekend. Other murder charges have likewise been filed against Teves over the killing of three persons in Negros Oriental in 2019. These were filed in Bayawan City in Negros but the DOJ is asking for their transfer to Manila. “We want the venue of the trial on neutral ground, and it will all be done here,” Clavano said in Filipino. He said the DOJ hopes that the courts will issue an arrest warrant on the former Negros Oriental lawmaker “in the next few days.” The killing of Degamo took place in his residential compound in Pamplona while he was distributing aid. Nine other people were killed in the attack. Ten suspects are currently in the custody of the authorities, while one had been killed in an encounter with security forces. One of the suspects named a certain “Cong. Teves” as the person behind the attack against Degamo. In April, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said Teves appeared to be the “main mastermind” in the killing of Degamo, likening him to an “executive producer of a movie.” He has also dubbed Marvin Miranda, one of the alleged masterminds in the case, as a “director or casting director.” In May, Remulla said Teves was in Timor-Leste to seek asylum. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Teves’ application was denied. In August, the Anti-Terrorism Council designated Teves and 12 others as terrorists, citing several alleged killings and harassment in Negros Oriental. According to Clavano, the designation as a terrorist was meant to “clip Teves’ wings and limit his financial capacity and financial transactions” as it would mean freezing the former lawmakers’ assets. Teves was expelled on Aug. 16 from the House of Representatives for disorderly conduct and his continued absence despite an expired travel authority. The former lawmaker earlier said he is not inclined to go home yet due to fears over his safety. He has also appealed to authorities for fairness and asked them to look at all angles in the killing of Degamo. When sought for comment, Teves’ lawyer Ferdinand Topacio said he has not yet read the DOJ resolution indicting his client. “May I reserve my comment until I’ve read it?” he said in a text message.",

    "date_published": "2024-12-19T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) is standing pat on its decision to ban the importation of buffalo meat from three Indian states, citing the need to protect local livestock population against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said he has already responded to the appeal made by Philippine Association of Meat Processors Inc. (PAMPI) regarding the ban imposed on imports of Indian buffalo meat (IBM) from the states of Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana. Tiu Laurel said he could not lift the import ban since the presence of FMD in the three states were confirmed by the DA inspection mission (DAIM) as well as by the Indian government itself through an official document. “The suppliers in the three areas knew that there was an FMD there already and yet they did not tell us. If they (PAMPI) can get a document that says that these areas are FMD-free then we can lift [the ban],” he said. The agriculture chief said 18 percent of the samples taken by the DAIM in the three states tested positive with FMD. PAMPI earlier appealed to Tiu Laurel to reconsider the ban imposed on the three Indian states, claiming that it would cause supply disruptions to the industry by the first quarter of next year. PAMPI argued that there has been no reported case of transmission of the FMD virus from the imported Indian buffalo meat in the past 30 years because both DA-accredited suppliers and local meat processors strictly comply with the guidelines set by the World Organization for Animal Health. The group added that meat processors have been implementing the necessary protocols in inactivating FMD virus should they be found present in the raw materials they sourced. The group also argued that the DA should also ban the importation of IBM from the state of Uttar Pradesh, citing the presence of FMD based on reports of International Society for Infectious Diseases and mainstream media in India. However, Tiu Laurel explained that the DAIM did not find the existence of FMD in Uttar Pradesh, hence, there is no basis to ban IBM imports from the Indian state. The Indian government also did not officially report to the Philippines that there is FMD in Uttar Pradesh, he added. “I told them why not just buy from the new accredited plants? Why are you pushing for banned plants and areas? Why are you pushing me to allow areas proven to have FMD as tested by the Indian government,” he recalled telling a PAMPI representative. The DA has expanded the number of accredited foreign meat establishments (FMEs) in India allowed to export IBM to the Philippines to 34 from the previously just six FMEs. However, 13 of the accredited FMEs will not be able to immediately export carabeef to the Philippines since they are located in the three Indian states with FMD. According to Tiu Laurel, he would allow the importation of boiled carabeef from the FMEs in the FMD-affected Indian states if they have the capacity to do so. “If they can do that, I will allow it,” he said, citing the case of Pakistan exporting boiled carabeef to China. Tiu Laurel explained that the expansion of accredited FMEs to export IBM to the Philippines is meant to increase competition in the domestic market with the goal of driving down costs of imported meat products.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The plan of the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) to build its headquarters in an environmental reserve in Tanay, Rizal is set to be probed by the Senate committee on tourism. The inquiry was prompted by a resolution filed by the committee chair, Sen. Nancy Binay, who cited the warning of the Masungi Georeserve Foundation that the BuCor’s plan would have an adverse impact on the environment and the tourism industry. “The Masungi Georeserve is a conservation area and a rustic rock garden tucked in the rainforests of Rizal. Masungi’s name is derived from the word ‘masungki,’ which translates to ‘spiked’ – an apt description for the sprawling limestone landscape found within,” Binay said in her Senate Resolution 495. “The Masungi Georeserve is a symbol of sustainable development and at the forefront of efforts to conserve, restore and improve the environment in the face of climate change, which must be protected by the government and private sector at all costs,” she said. “While the initiatives of the BuCor to have a new headquarters and housing for its personnel are reasonable, it is important to weigh the possible consequences of building its headquarters in an ecotourism site like the Masungi Georeserve, which may affect the environment and tourism in the country,” she added. Binay cited news reports quoting acting BuCor Director General Gregorio Catapang Jr. as having claimed that the bureau is the owner of the 270-hectare land in Tanay where its headquarters and residential sites for personnel will be put up. This claim, however, is strongly being contested by the foundation. She noted that in 2019, the Masungi Georeserve received international recognition for its sustainable tourism practices at the annual World Tourism Organization Awards. Ann Dumaliang, co-founder of the Masungi Georeserve, said the site being eyed as a relocation site is home to fragile limestone formations and included in conservation efforts under the Masungi Geopark Project between the Masungi Georeserve Foundation and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, through a valid and binding memorandum of agreement signed by then environment secretary Gina Lopez in 2017. Binay also said scientists of the National Museum of the Philippines warned that developing the relocation site will have dire consequences for the environment.",

    "date_published": "2022-12-27T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — More investments in cold storage facilities for the agriculture sector are needed next year to reduce post-harvest losses and improve farmers’ income, the Philippine Chamber of Agriculture and Food Inc. (PCAFI) said. PCAFI president Danilo Fausto said the lack of cold storage facilities remains a big problem in the country. In 2020, the Department of Agriculture (DA) already underscored the need to establish more cold storage facilities in the country. Two years after, the Philippines is still lacking in terms of storage facilities and other infrastructure, resulting in high spoilage of farm produce. As an example, Nueva Ecija only has 10 cold storage facilities; Bulacan has eight; the National Capital Region has 27; Pangasinan has two and Occidental Mindoro has two as of September 2021. These facilities are still enough to store agricultural products, Fausto said. “The idea is to build more cold storage facilities for bumper harvests. Cold storage facilities are dual purpose…it can be a freezer or a chiller,” he said. The PCAFI official said there are pre-fabricated cold storage facilities which can be put up in a short time. With cold storage facilities, the sector can maintain the freshness and quality of farm and fishery products, especially for bumper harvest, leading to reduced importation. “If you have the bumper harvest…you don’t need to import. With bumper harvests, we will have more or less some surplus,” Fausto said. Onions, for example, had a shortage of supply as early as July. Prices of red onions skyrocketed to as high as P300 per kilo. “We have failed to import something like 40,000 to 50,000 so we are short of supply,” Fausto said. The DA earlier considered importing onions this month, but sidetracked this option as it expects some early onion harvest this month while full-blown harvest is seen by February. With harvests coming in soon, Fausto said it was the right move to not import onions. “It’s now too late to import. The importation should go sometime about July or August,” he said. The PCAFI official also expects a lot of harvest from January to March, filling up cold storage facilities. “By April, we might see onions being thrown away because storage is no longer available. So, the idea is to put up cold storage facilities,” Fausto said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A “videoke” session by several police officers as protesters were holding demonstrations along Commonwealth Avenue during President Marcos’ State of the Nation Address (SONA) was not meant to bully anyone, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Brig. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. said on Monday. He issued the statement when a video of the session went viral and was described by Rachell Villamor, who uploaded the video on Twitter, as “very disrespectful.” Villamor said the police officers’ singing drowned out the voices of Southern Luzon farmers and youth as they were holding a protest to air their concerns to the government. “Instead of hearing the pleas of the activists, the (Quezon City Police District or QCPD) was having a videoke to drown out the program,” Villamor said. Nartatez said he did not see anything wrong with what the police officers did and it was not meant to bully the activists. “It is for morale boosting for our personnel,” he said in an interview after the SONA. Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said the city government launched an investigation and found that the police officers seen singing in the video were not from the QCPD but from the NCRPO. This prompted the city government to relay the concern instead to the Philippine National Police so that activists will be able to “peacefully and freely convey their concerns.” QCPD director Nicolas Torre III belied Villamor’s claims, saying the patrol vehicle in the video was far from the site of the protest. He cited a screenshot of a closed-circuit television footage that showed the location of the patrol vehicle and the stage where the protest rally was being held. “I am sure that you couldn’t hear the singing because the stage was far from the noise in Philcoa. You are a liar as well as your peers,” he said in a Facebook post on Monday.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Laguindingan International Airport will soon be seeing upgrades after the government signed a P12.75 billion project with Aboitiz InfraCapital Inc. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. oversaw the signing of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project concession at Malacañan Palace on Monday, October 28. “With the influx of travelers in the Mindanao Region, the signing of this Concession Agreement for the Laguindingan International Airport – Public-Private Partnership Project provides us with the opportunity to expand the facilities, upgrade the terminals, augment capacity, and deliver our services in a safer, efficient and more convenient way,” Marcos said at the signing. The Laguindingan International Airport in Northern Mindanao is the gateway to many key places on the southern island. “This vision can only be realized through our united efforts and steadfast commitment to work together, to work hand in hand. With that, this Administration extends our gratitude to the supportive and visionary partners in the private sector, particularly, Aboitiz InfraCapital Inc.,” Marcos said. Marcos said that the upgrade of the airport will improve its capacity first, from 3.9 million passengers to 6.3 million. He also promised improved tourism, job creation, business presence and economic growth. “To the officials and employees of the Department of Transportation, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, the Public-Private Partnership Center, and all concerned agencies, I urge you to remain on track in completing and implementing transportation projects,” Marcos said. Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista said that Aboitiz will now take over Laguinduingan Airport’s operations and maintenance for over 30 years. The Department of Transportation said that some of Aboitiz’s responsibilities include reconfiguring terminal space, as well as the construction of the new Passenger Terminal Building.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is set to release on Dec. 4 the list of Philippine products and services to be given preference in government procurement as part of the Tatak Pinoy Act. During the Kapihan sa Manila Bay on Wednesday, Ma.Theresa Faustino, officer-in-charge director of DTIs Bureau of Policy Research and Innovation, said the DTI would release the list during the Tatak Pinoy Summit to be held on Dec. 4. During the summit, she said the DTI would announce all projects and activities undertaken since the signing of the Tatak Pinoy (Proudly Filipino) Act or Republic Act 11981, last Feb. 26. We will be launching or announcing the partial list of products and services that will be given preference in terms of government procurement, Faustino said. The issuance of the list of products to be given preference in government procurement forms part of the Tatak Pinoy Act to strengthen the domestic industry. The law seeks to encourage the production of globally competitive Philippine products and services. Faustino said the list to be released next month, would continue to be updated as the DTI obtains data. “We cannot determine (everything) in a short period of time. It is not cast in stone. So it is a live list, active list. We will be improving on it based on what we get from data,” she said. She said the list will include cement. Aside from the partial list of products and services given preference, she said the DTI would also be presenting the draft of the multi-year Tatak Pinoy strategy, which will include all plans, programs and activities to be undertaken under the Tatak Pinoy Act. The strategy includes inputs from consultations conducted with the different industries. “We will be presenting the framework for development, issues, constraints experienced by industries and proposed solutions,” Faustino said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa yesterday urged the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to review the requirements being asked of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in order to practice their profession. At the launch of the “Philippine Council for Mental Health (PCMH) Strategic Framework” at the Rizal Park Hotel in Manila, Herbosa said much is asked of psychologists and psychiatrists who are only assigned salary grade 11. “The problem in (the field of) psychology in government is that there is a need for a master’s degree but is only assigned salary grade 11,” said the Department of Health (DOH) chief. The official stressed that a higher salary should be given psychologists. He added, “How can we encourage applicants for guidance counselor items if that is the case. I’m calling the CSC to change that.” The official cited as an example nurses who are assigned salary grade 15. “They don’t have master’s degree yet, but they are assigned salary grade 15. That should also be (salary grade) 15 or even higher (for psychologists).” In partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), the DOH yesterday launched the PCMH Strategic Framework to guide the development and implementation of mental health policies, programs and services to address the significant burden of mental illness and improve mental health and well-being in the country. The five-year strategic plan aims to reduce premature mortality, prevent and treat substance abuse effectively, and reduce the vulnerability of individuals and communities to mental, neurological and substance use disorders. “Today, as we launch the 2024-2028 PCMH Strategic Framework, I am confident that we can address more mental health concerns in the country,” said Herbosa. “We commit to implementing pro-equity strategies to ensure access to universal health care and develop resilient health systems in the country that respond to the mental health and well-being needs of every citizen,” WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rui Paulo de Jesus said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Children ages one to four years old can now register with the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) for the national ID. In a statement, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said the rollout of this service is part of its efforts to get more Filipinos to register with the PhilSys, including minors. To register, a parent or guardian who is already PhilSys-registered will need to be present. The child’s PhilSys number or permanent identification number will be linked to the accompanying parent or guardian. For the registration, the PSA said the accompanying parent or guardian will need to present supporting documents to validate the child’s demographic information. Any of the following supporting documents may be presented: certificate of live birth issued by the PSA or the Local Civil Registry Office; report of birth issued by the PSA or Philippine Foreign Service Post; certificate of foundling issued by the PSA, and certificate of foundling or certificate of live birth or persons with no known parent/s issued by the PSA. Parents or guardians may also present the child’s municipal form 102; Philippine passport or ePassport issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs; or any document showing the full name of the child, date and place of birth, the full name of the mother and the full name of the father, if acknowledged. Upon validation of demographic information, a front-facing photograph of the child will be taken. Other biometric information including the fingerprints, iris scan and the updated front-facing photograph will be captured after the child reaches the age of five. “We encourage parents and guardians to join us in taking the step towards a new Philippines for the next generation by registering their children ages one to four to PhilSys,” PSA Undersecretary Dennis Mapa said. The PSA said PhilSys registration activities continue to be implemented across the country. Registration centers remain open to walk-in registrations, while mobile registration activities are also being conducted for those residing in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas or have no means to visit any registration centers.",

    "article_body": "The British Chamber of Commerce Philippines (BCCP) ended 2024 on a positive note–citing the passage of its priority legislation covering areas on agriculture, financial services, and tax reforms. For 2025, the British Chamber remains optimistic and identifies remaining key priority legislation including the Cybersecurity Act, E- Governance Act, and Open Access in Data Transmission Act. BCCP Executive Director/Trustee Chris Nelson during the SGV Tax Symposium commended the key developments presented by the officials from various government agencies such as the Anti-Red Tape Authority, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), Bureau of Customs (BOC), Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), and Sen. Win Gatchalian. In an interview, Nelson noted that, “It is very important that government agencies are looking into various areas and actions to take. Hopefully, the recommendations materialize and convince more British investors to put their money here…” Taking advantage of UK excellence in various areas including cybersecurity and effective regulatory practices, the British Chamber consistently supports the passage of the Cybersecurity Act to further strengthen the cybersecurity posture and combat cyberthreats to increase investor confidence in the Philippines. Nelson further noted the presence of UK cybersecurity companies, two of which are its Members such as CyberQ Group and NCC Group. Meanwhile, the E-Governance Act will further improve the country’s connectivity through digitalization to provide an efficient and institutionalized approach. In 2024, the British Chamber has been actively involved in working with ARTA and has officially become an ARTA Champion, allowing them to directly receive complaints from its Members to effectively address the concerns on red tape and reduce bureaucracies. Moreover, the Konektadong Pinoy Act aims to provide a competitive telecommunications sector, transcending growth across different sectors including agriculture, education, and health as noted by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). Despite developments, Nelson reiterated the importance of reinforcing the market opportunities in the Philippines to effectively compete with its neighboring countries. Nelson further added that, “The Philippines has great opportunities, its population growth is young and dynamic. The UK is looking at infrastructure, green energy, services, and food and beverage and we need to keep stressing the benefits of coming here. We are very optimistic but we have to keep working hard.”",

The completion of ANAR will not only reduce travel time from Clark International Airport to New Clark City from one hour to 20 minutes but will also pave the way for more tourists and investments in the province, according to Marcos. “This road is much more than just an access road. It is part of our plan to propel Clark as an alternate growth area. It is a red carpet rolled out to those who will partake of all the best things that Clark can offer,” the President said. “It shows the path forward, of Building Better More so we will never lose our competitive advantage because unlocking the full potential of Clark is a continuing task,” he added. The project will also save commuters’ money as it will remain toll free, the President said. Marcos directed the Bases Conversion and Development Authority to ensure the timely completion of the remaining works for the six-lane highway. As of Feb. 14, the access road is 95.21 percent complete. All remaining works is expected to be completed by June 24. Marcos underscored that his administration is not only transforming Clark’s physical capital, but is also upskilling its manpower. Clark has a lot of potential as it can host various economic activities including innovation labs, creative workshops, manufacturing concerns, leisure complexes and cyber corridor, Marcos said. The new Clark International Airport, he noted, has earned international recognition and was hailed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Prix Versailles as one of the most beautiful airports in the world.",

President Marcos ordered the DENR and the Department of Public Works and Highways to expedite the programs, Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said over the weekend. Marcos also wants local communities to directly benefit from the implementation of the National Adaptation Plan, she added. The impact of temperature increases, rainfall changes, sea level rise and typhoons could increase to P1.4 trillion in 2030 or around eight percent of the 2020 gross domestic product (GDP), Loyzaga noted. “Our goal is to build transformative climate resilience, minimize losses and damage and achieve sustainable socio-economic development by 2050. The strategies and outcomes address impacts specifically on food security, water resources, health, ecosystems and biodiversity, population migration and the preservation of cultural heritage,” she said. The World Bank estimated the country was losing up to 1.2 percent of GDP annually in the last decade beginning in 2011 due to the rapid onset of typhoons alone, she added. “This figure did not include the impacts of prolonged periods of drought, which we considered slow onset disasters especially during El Niño years, and the impacts of extreme rainfall events on lives, livelihoods and infrastructure,” she said. The country also needs to make adaptation and disaster risk reduction priorities, she noted. “We are hosting the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference this year – a golden opportunity to learn and do more. We urge you to adopt your host ecosystems and communities beyond your fence lines, as stewards and partners,” Loyzaga said.",

    "date_published": "2024-01-11T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) expects the country’s total exports to grow by 10 percent this year. In an interview with reporters, DTI-Export Marketing Bureau director Bianca Sykimte said that based on market projections, if everything is business as usual, the country’s exports are expected to grow by 10 percent this year. “So definitely, we’ll try to achieve more than 10 percent for export growth,”she said. Nevertheless, Sykimte emphasized that in order to meet the export targets outlined in the Philippine Export Development Plan (PEDP 2023-2028) for this year, the country requires a 40 percent growth in exports. “For us to be able to catch up with our PEDP targets, we need to grow by about 40 percent this year because we did not meet the target for 2023,” Sykimte said. Based on the PEDP, the Philippines was targeting export revenues of $126.8 billion last year. Both the DTI and industry stakeholders earlier said that this target would likely be missed. Latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that merchandise exports from January to November 2023 reached $67.03 billion, an 8.4 percent decline from the $73.18 billion registered in the same period in 2022. Service exports from January to September 2023, on the other hand, grew by 20.7 percent to $34.7 billion, according to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Under the PEDP, the Philippines is targeting export revenues of $143.4 billion this year. “It’s a bit difficult, but we really need to attract investment sto build our domestic capacities,” Sykimte said. Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual explained that part of the DTI’s strategy of increasing exports is to bring foreign manufacturers, export-oriented foreign manufacturers, to locate in the Philippines.",

    "date_published": "2023-06-08T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) has partnered with the municipalities of Dinalupihan and Hermosa, and the Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) to pilot zero-kilometer or “0 KM” food project in the province. In a statement yesterday, the DA recently signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the municipalities of Dinalupihan and Hermosa, and the BPSU to ensure that the targets of the 0 KM project will be met. The agency said 0 KM promotes healthy eating while minimizing the cost and environmental impact of transporting the products. It supports the use and consumption of locally grown fruits, vegetables, and other non-industrially produced food products that have not traveled far, or more literally that the food has traveled “zero kilometers” before being eaten. DA Senior Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban said the initiative forms part of the commitment of President Marcos toward a food-secure nation. “This program started with our President in his SONA (State of the Nation Address) where he said that it is necessary to complete the value chain of the products we import or buy, but that is not happening because of many obstacles in the municipalities on the way to markets, especially in Metro Manila,” he said. Under the MOA, the DA, through Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR), will provide funding for a research that will examine the factors influencing supply and demand in the two municipalities. This includes commodity prices and expenditure movements by identifying the major stakeholders in the market economy and analyzing consumer behavior. “We, at DA-BAR, support studies and projects like this, because with the 0 km project, we are hitting three important goals: help promote income from local production, reduce marketing cost for increased income for producers and with less pollution from transporting goods, we save our environment – all these towards a healthier and food securer nation,” BAR assistant director Joell Lales said. Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) and National Program Director of the High Value Crops and Development Program (HVCDP) director Gerald Glenn Panganiban said this is the outcome of the lessons learned from the difficulties that the HVCDP previously faced. The DA established a National Technical Working Group under Special Order No. 437, which was approved last April. The agency said the project aims to develop the food demand and supply structure of the Municipalities of Hermosa and Dinalupihan, Bataan, towards the end goal of sustainable and stable local food production and consumption of locally produced high-value crops and other agricultural commodities.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — As part of the fruit deal with China clinched by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in January, the Philippines shipped the first batch of durian to China on Thursday, according to the Department of Agriculture. In a news release, the DA said the shipment of 28 tons of durian -- weighing approximately 28,000 kilograms -- was sourced from producers and processors in Mindanao. Exports of durian to China are among the many fruit export plans under the $2 billion bilateral agreement that Marcos signed during his state visit to China in January. The deal also covers the shipment of other agricultural products, like coconut and bananas, among others, according to state news outfit Philippine News Agency. During the same visit to China, the DA and customs administration of China signed an agreement for the protocol of phytosanitary requirements – a measure that certifies crops have been inspected – for the export of fresh durians from the Philippines to China. Five packaging facilities and 58 durian farms have been greenlighted by the Chinese government for the shipment of durian, according to the news release. The DA also said on Saturday that an additional consignment of durians weighing 28 tons was sent through airfreight, while 10 container vans with a combined weight of 7.2 tons were transported by sea. “The deal is expected to gain $260 million or P14.3 billion in revenue for the local durian industry,” the department added. Marcos told business leaders in January that durian growers from Davao -- which produces around 78% of durian in the country -- were ready to meet the demand of the Chinese market for the fruit, according to a PNA news report.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang has submitted the ad interim appointment papers of newly designated Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon and Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Secretary Jay Ruiz to the Commission on Appointments (CA) for confirmation. The CA, however, could not act on the nominations of Dizon and Ruiz as Congress went on recess on Feb. 7 to give way to the campaign for the midterm elections. Session resumes on June 2. The 19th Congress will have only two weeks or six session days from June 2 to 13 before adjourning sine die. CA assistant minority leader and Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel announced that the commission received the papers of two newly appointed Cabinet members of President Marcos. “We have already received Secretary Dizon’s papers as well as those of newly appointed PCO Secretary Ruiz,” Pimentel said. Pimentel said that under the 1987 Constitution, Malacañang may issue key ad interim appointments while Congress is not in session. Pimentel, however, noted that ad interim appointments become invalid if disapproved by the CA or if left unconfirmed by the time Congress adjourns. Marcos appointed Dizon as DOTr secretary on Feb. 21, and the CA received his appointment papers on Feb. 24. Dizon succeeded Jaime Bautista, who stepped down from his post due to health reasons. Previously, Dizon served as presidential adviser on flagship programs and projects and as president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) during the Duterte administration. Ruiz was appointed head of the PCO on Feb. 24, and the CA received his appointment papers on Feb. 25. Along with Dizon and Ruiz, Pimentel confirmed that the CA has received the appointment papers of four new constitutional commissioners: Noli Pipo and Maria Norina Tangaro-Casingal of the Commission on Elections, Luis Meinrado Pañgulayan of the Civil Service Commission and Douglas Michael Mallillin of the Commission on Audit. All four commissioners were appointed on Feb. 10. The CA received their appointment papers on the same day.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — E-commerce plays an important role in the country’s economic development, according to Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in partnership with the Philippine Bar Association, held on Friday the first e-commerce congress, which aims to promote a robust e-commerce environment in the Philippines. “We have all the ingredients – the economic assets – to make this happen: a young and digital native population, a growing middle class, available and affordable technologies and significant surpluses in the financial sector,” Pascual said. “E-commerce is one of the most potent tools and fastest routes in unlocking these economic assets toward sustained accelerated economic development,” he added. The event aims to promote a robust e-commerce environment in the Philippines, where online businesses, especially small ones, can develop and compete globally. Based on Google Temasek Bain’s e-Conomy SEA 2022 report, the Philippines’ internet economy continues its upward trend, growing by 20 percent to $20 billion this year from a year ago with e-commerce propelling it to $35 billion by 2025. According to the DTI, the number of businesses on retail sales via the internet has increased, while there has also been an increase in the number of consumer complaints against online sellers. Due to this, the DTI said the time is ripe for a new, relevant, and responsive e-commerce Law. Last year, DTI launched the e-commerce Philippines 2022 roadmap to employ government strategies that will speed up and broaden internet transactions by improving the digital infrastructure. “The current administration is bent on working on and enhancing this agenda to increase the contribution of eCommerce to the Philippine economy with the development of the eCommerce Philippines 2023-2025 Roadmap,” the DTI said. Meanwhile, Pascual pointed out that there are new laws and regulations related to e- commerce that are currently being drafted, such as on privacy, digital taxation, the gig economy, and pivoting to a cash-light society. “I hope that there will be productive dialogues in these areas because we urgently need to develop and improve our policies to create an enabling regulatory environment for e-commerce to grow,” he said. The e-commerce congress brought together government officials, members of the business sector, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to pursue the overarching goal of strengthening eCommerce industry in the country. The e-commerce congress tackled the Internet Transactions bill, which aims to harness the overwhelming potential of the e-commerce market.",

During the visit, the agencies exchanged information on their programs, particularly projects in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). KOICA said it “looks forward to strengthen its partnership with JICA to maximize effectiveness of support to the Philippines.” Last Sept. 21, JICA Philippines chief representative Sakamoto Takema and his delegation visited KOICA Philippines to explore how the two agencies can collaborate on common areas of interest. In that meeting, both agencies shared information on their respective official development assistance (ODA) programs. The agencies also discussed ways to enhance development cooperation in the Philippines. KOICA Philippines country director Kim Eunsub assured JICA of KOICA’s full support for future development initiatives. The National Economic and Development Authority’s 2022 ODA portfolio review report showed foreign aid from South Korea reached $910 million or 2.81 percent of the Philippines’ total active ODA last year.

There have been speculative reports in recent days that Balisacan, an agricultural economist, was being eyed to take over from Marcos as DA chief. As head of the National Economic and Development Authority, Balisacan is part of the government’s team of economic managers. The head of the team, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno, described as a “sound proposal” the appointment of Balisacan to the top DA post. Diokno had revealed last week that the economic team was “shocked” and was not consulted on the imposition of price caps on rice at P41 per kilo for regular milled and P45 for well-milled. Diokno and another member of the team, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, however, issued statements declaring support for the price caps within a short period. Shortly before the measure went into effect, Balisacan had told The STAR that the price ceilings would be lifted based on the food inflation trend. He also said the government was studying the reduction of rice tariffs to stabilize prices. The Department of Trade and Industry said the price caps would be reviewed after two weeks, amid complaints from rice retailers about massive losses and consumers’ complaints about the disappearance of regular and well-milled rice varieties. Food inflation has driven record-high inflation in the first year of the Marcos administration, with price surges and supply problems recorded in agricultural commodities including onions, white refined sugar, rice, eggs, chicken and large potatoes. Amid calls for Marcos to relinquish the DA post, he has said there have been no takers. Among the persons mentioned as possible DA secretary is former senator Mar Roxas, a relative by affinity of the President.",

    "date_published": "2024-07-15T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Energy (DOE) is expecting some 12,212 households to benefit from another round of a competitive selection process (CSP) for the development of microgrid systems in remote areas of the country. The DOE will open the auction in the first week of August to interested bidders for the electrification of 41 lots composed initially of 75 identified unserved and underserved areas in the Philippines. The identified areas were among the 98 identified areas clustered into 49 lots previously offered during the first round of the CSP in November 2023. According to the DOE, these areas are viable for microgrid system providers (MGSPs) “given their higher demand, and most of the households are not widely dispersed.” “The second round of MGSP-CSP will follow a streamlined and transparent process that will allow MGSP proponents to survey the areas and prepare their proposal according to the (schedule),” it said. The submission of an expression of interest and pre-qualification is set for the fourth week of August, while the opening of technical and financial bid proposals is scheduled for the fourth week of September. The notice of award will be issued by the first week of December. Republic Act 11646, or the Microgrid Systems Act of 2022, mandates the conduct of a CSP before an MGSP can serve off-grid areas. Based on the 2023–2032 National Total Electrification Roadmap, there are 407 areas in the country that lack or have limited access to electricity, of which 285 are unserved, comprising 20,103 households, while 122 are underserved, with a total of around 20,207 households. Unserved areas are those that have no access to electricity, distribution system lines, home power systems or any microgrid system, while underserved areas refer to currently served areas where power supply is less than 24 hours daily.

    "date_published": "2025-01-10T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) missed its tobacco excise tax collection target by more than a quarter as illicit trade continued and became even more prevalent in the domestic market. BIR head revenue executive assistant Dondanon Galera said total tobacco excise tax collection last year stood at P134 billion, about P51 billion short of the agency’s P185 billion target collection in 2023. Total tobacco excise tax collection last year was also relatively flat compared to the P134.91 billion the BIR collected in 2023. The change in consumption patterns of smokers, including the shift to vape, and the prevalence of illicit trade in the country curtailed the BIR’s capacity to hit its collection target, Galera said. During a Senate committee on ways and means hearing, Galera admitted that sellers of illicit cigarettes and vape products have become “more brazen” last year. “They are even selling on online platforms,” he said yesterday. The BIR conducted at least 141 raids on illegal vapor products and three on illicit cigarettes last year, Galera said. Philippine Tobacco Institute president Jericho Nograles said the increase in illicit cigarette supply in the country coincided with the uptick in the number of Filipino adult smokers in recent years. Citing Food and Nutrition Research Institute data, Nograles said the percentage of adult Filipino smokers at the end of 2023 rose to 23.2 percent from 18.5 percent in 2021. This increase mirrored the rise in illicit cigarette trade in the country that reached 19.8 percent in 2023 from 13.6 percent in 2021 based on Euromonitor data, Nograles added. “Illicit trade thrives due to the availability of untaxed cigarettes sold at a fraction of legitimate products. Legal cigarettes are up to five times (more expensive) than (its) illicit counterparts,” he said. Nograles said the diminishing state revenues on tobacco excise taxes could be attributed more to tax leakages than the change in consumption patterns from cigarettes to vape. “The shift is minimal compared to the presence of illicit trade,” he said. The BIR has been reeling from the illicit trade of tobacco in the country, which contributes to why the agency has been missing its collection target for excise products. There is also the transition to vape products. The BIR has difficulties in going after illegal ones given that it has become a backyard industry whose production can be done even at home. Finance Secretary Ralph Recto earlier said the government loses at least P52 billion in revenues because of tobacco and vape smuggling with P35 billion of which being illicit tobacco products.",

    "article_body": "COTABATO CITY, Philippines — The defense department has augmented the artillery assets of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division with eight modern large truck-mounted canons from Israel to boost its anti-terror operations. Major Gen. Roy Galido, commander of 6th ID, on Saturday briefed reporters on the technical intricacies of the eight 155 millimeter Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System, or ATMOS 2000, that the national government shipped to Camp Siongco in Maguindanao via the seaport in General Santos City. The eight ATMOS 2000 arrived at the Makar Port in General Santos City Thursday. “These are surely effective artillery equipment,” Galido said during a brief talk with reporters in Camp Siongco on Saturday. The 6th ID’s headquarters is located in Camp Siongco in nearby Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao, near the Cotabato City Airport. Lt. Gen. Alfredo Rosario Jr., commander of Western Mindanao Command, said the latest weaponry system will be operated by the 10th Field Artillery Battalion of the Army Artillery Regiment based at Camp Lucero, Carmen, Cotabato. “The acquisition of these assets will significantly contribute to the peace, security, and development efforts of the government in the southwestern Philippines,” Rosario said. Each of the eight ATMOS 2000 units has an automatic shell loading system, way too advanced compared to the old 155 millimeter canons that soldiers have been using since the outbreak of the Mindanao secessionist conflict in the early 1970s. Galido said the 6th ID is thankful to acting Defense Secretary Jose Faustino Jr. and the Headquarters of the Philippine Army for sending them eight ATMOS 2000 units. He said Faustino had branded the artillery units as “game-changer” in the military’s fight against enemies of state, including terrorist groups in central Mindanao --- the Dawlah Islamiya and its ally, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. Both groups, operating in the fashion of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have forces in a number of towns in central Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, North Cotabato, Maguindanao, Sarangani and Sultan Kudarat. The Dawlah Islamiya and the BIFF both have a reputation for setting off home-made bombs in public places to avenge deaths of members in clashes with pursuing units of 6th ID.",

At the same time, the top health official said that they are looking at making the salary of nurses in government health facilities equivalent to what is being earned by the nurses in the private sector. “I will also meet with some of the legislators and discuss with them possible measures to make the salary of nurses both in public and private sector equitable,” said Herbosa. “What we want is to hire additional HCWs given that there are those seeking jobs abroad and we cannot prevent them from doing that,” he added. Herbosa also said that he is considering hiring graduates of a four-year medical course even though they are not board passers yet. “They can be hired in government even without their license and classify them under the board eligible category wherein they will be given three to five years to pass the board exam,” the Department of Health chief said. In a separate televised interview, Herbosa said he is willing to employ unlicensed nursing graduates if they have diplomas from accredited nursing schools. – Evelyn Macairan",

    "date_published": "2024-08-08T15:24:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines amassed official development assistance (ODA) commitments amounting to $37.29 billion in 2023, according to a report released by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on Thursday. According to Republic Act 8182 or Official Development Assistance Act of 1996, ODA is a loan or grant administered \"to promote sustainable social and economic development and welfare of the Philippines.\" \"ODA resources must be contracted with governments of foreign countries with whom the Philippines has diplomatic, trade relations or bilateral agreements, or which are members of the United Nations, their agencies, and international or multilateral lending institutions,\" the law stated. The majority of ODA commitment is composed of project loans amounting to P24.94 billion, which is 67% of the total amount. There are also program loans amounting to $10.13 billion (27%) and grants worth $2.22 billion (6%). A program loan is a budget for general projects while project loans are for a specific development project. The NEDA reported a total of 90 project loans and 23 program loans. “The loan commitments reached a notable milestone in 2023, marking a significant 16% increase of $4.87 billion from the $30.20 billion committed in 2022. This surge continues the upward trend observed during the 2020-2022 period, characterized by heightened assistance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” NEDA said in its report. Infrastructure takes up the largest portion of the ODA, with $20.36 billion dedicated to it from 105 loans and grants. The second largest portion went to governance and institutions development, with $6.88 billion allocation. The rest went to agriculture, agrarian reform and natural resources, as well as social reform and community development. According to the NEDA, the Department of Transportation is the agency that got the largest portion of the ODA, taking $13 billion for its projects. The Department of Finance and the Department of Public Works and Highway followed, respectively. The top 10 largest ODA-funded projects are as follows: North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR) Malolos-Tutuban NSCR Extension Project (Clark Extension) NSCR-Philippine National Railways (PNR) South Commuter Railway Project (Tutuban-Calamba) Metro Manila Subway Project Phase I Bataan Cavite Interlink Bridge Panay-Guimaras-Negros Island Bridges Project PNR South Long-Haul Project Cebu-Mactan Bridge and Coastal Road Construction Project Davao Public Transport Modernization Project LRT Line 1 South Extension Project Japan is the number one source of ODA for the Philippines in 2023, pledging $12.7 billion. The Asian Development Bank followed suit with $11.43 billion and the World Bank is the third largest lender, pledging $8.19 billion. Despite tensions between Beijing and Manila over the West Philippine Sea, China gave an ODA amounting to $1.16 billion.",

    "article_body": "What does it take to produce vehicle license plates and plastic driver’s license cards? For about a decade now, motorists have been promised license plates and plastic driver’s license cards. The items are fully paid for upon vehicle registration or approval of the application for a driver’s license. And yet as of today, the country still has a backlog of 130,000 plastic driver’s license cards, and the number could grow as more people renew or apply for new driver’s license. The shortage of vehicle license plates is even worse. The Commission on Audit, in its annual report on the Land Transportation Office, counted 1.797 million pairs of license plates worth P808.702 million, already paid for by vehicle owners from as far back as 2015, still undelivered. Some owners at the time had sighed that they had bought brand-new vehicles and sold these years later without ever getting the license plates. COA auditors reported that of 2,561,629 pairs of license plates paid for by vehicle owners, only 764,514 pairs had been produced by the LTO as of the end of 2022. Of the 764,514 pairs, the COA said only 506,059 had been distributed to LTO regional offices for release to the vehicle owners. The remaining 258,455 pairs were still waiting to be packaged at the LTO’s plate making plant, state auditors said. LTO data showed that since April this year, a daily average of 2,000 new drivers failed to get their plastic license cards. Officials of the LTO’s mother agency the Department of Transportation have said delivery of the plastic cards is expected to start by next week, and the situation is seen to normalize by September. Motorists can only hope that the date is September 2023 instead of another eight years of waiting. In previous years, influential groups competing to corner the production of driver’s license cards and vehicle license plates led to lawsuits that stalled production and distribution of the items. The backlog for new motorcycle plates is even worse. The COA reported that of over 20.5 million new plates paid for upon registration from 2014 to 2022, only 8.65 million for the requirements from 2018 to 2022 had been produced and issued by the LTO – a backlog of 11,859,496 motorcycle plates as of end-2022. Under the current administration, Department of Transportation officials initially said they would contract the services of government printers to speed up the production of plastic license cards. What has happened? And can the backlog in license plates ever end? Surely it doesn’t require rocket science to address the problems in the LTO.",

Biodiversity refers to all life forms on the planet. “We must all take action to safeguard these precious resources for future generations,” he added.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Criminal charges should immediately be filed against a former policeman who assaulted and drew a pistol on a cyclist, Interior and Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos said yesterday. In an interview with The STAR, Abalos said the National Police Commission (Napolcom), which he chairs, is “monitoring what is happening closely” following an allegation by lawyer Raymond Fortun that the Philippine National Police (PNP) is coddling retired policeman Wilfredo Gonzales, who was seen in a viral video striking the cyclist on the head and drawing a gun on the cyclist during a road altercation near Welcome Rotonda on Aug. 8. “I really feel that criminal charges should be filed immediately” against Gonzales, Abalos said. He added that he is not satisfied with the PNP Firearms and Explosives Office’s revocation of Gonzales’ license to own and possess firearms, firearm registration and permit to carry outside residence. Abalos said the Napolcom is also monitoring police personnel responsible for filing the criminal cases against Gonzales. Protection? In a separate radio interview, Fortun – a cyclist himself – accused the PNP of protecting Gonzales. He said that as of Sunday night, “because of the threat from the PNP, including from (Quezon City Police District director) Gen. (Nicolas) Torre (III), the family decided not to file a criminal case.” Fortun added that Torre allegedly asked the cyclist not to pursue the charges against Gonzales. “I have the text of General Torre telling the cyclist not to interfere,” he said. According to Fortun, aside from Torre, a police major also called the cyclist on Gonzales’ behalf. Under duress Fortun added that the supposed amicable settlement between Gonzales and the cyclist is null and void. “If you are forced to sign an agreement under duress, it is null and void as you have no complete freedom while signing the document,” he said. Fortun alleged that right after the incident on Aug. 8, Gonzales brought the cyclist to the La Loma police station, where the former policeman was previously assigned, and forced the cyclist to pay P500 for the damage to his car. “Since (the cyclist) had only P800, he even pleaded to allow him to pay P500 since he was shaking from hunger,” he said. According to Fortun, police reportedly forced the vlogger who uploaded the video on social media to take it down after it went viral. “The real witness here is the person who shot the video. The problem is he was also threatened by police. I also have the text that the police threatened the vlogger, saying ‘I know the color of your vehicle and I know, it was you who posted the video,’ ” he said. Fortun said that he will submit a copy of the video to the Senate and the House of Representatives for possible investigation. Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito, another cyclist, said the Land Transportation Office should revoke Gonzales’ driver’s license. “The ex-cop should still be charged with grave threats, but unfortunately the cyclist seems to have been intimidated,” Ejercito said.",

In a statement, Pag-IBIG said its strong performance for the January to October period effectively surpassed its full-year 2021 income of P34.73 billion. Pag-IBIG CEO Marilene Acosta said this boosted the agency’s total assets to P810.07 billion as of end-October. This is a 10 percent improvement or about P65.49 billion higher than the 2021 level. “Even with still two months left before the year ends, the agency’s accomplishments as of October already showed that it shall have its best-performing year yet,” Acosta said. Housing chief and Pag-IBIG Fund board of trustees chair Jose Rizalino Acuzar, for his part, said the strong growth proves that Pag-IBIG funds and savings of members are being properly managed. Acuzar emphasized that this places Pag-IBIG in a strong position to continue providing social services in line with the directive of President Marcos. Over the next six years, Pag-IBIG intends to finance at least 708,000 housing units. Pag-IBIG has 14 million active members and has P800 billion in total assets which are expected to reach P1.5 trillion by 2028.",

    "date_published": "2025-04-01T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — Senior High School (SHS) learners under the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) track can now avail of free assessments for their National Certification (NC), following a joint announcement by the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The latest development was shared yesterday via the agencies' respective social media pages, with DepEd also releasing the implementing guidelines for the free assessments and the expansion of competency assessors. “This is pursuant to pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. (RA) 11975 or the 'General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024' and RA 12116 or the 'GAA for FY 2025,'” Education Secretary Sonny Angara stated via DepEd Order 003 s.2025. The order outlines the process for SHS-TVL learners to access free TESDA assessments and provides free accreditation for teaching and non-teaching personnel from both public and private schools as Technical-Vocational Education and Training (TVET) competency assessors. This initiative follows concerns over low assessment participation rates among Grade 12 learners, with figures showing only 25.7% participation in School Year (SY) 2019-2020, which further declined to just 6.8% in SY 2020-2021. The low turnout was attributed to the prohibitive costs of NC assessments, although no specific fees were mentioned. Interestingly, despite the low participation, those who took the assessments performed exceptionally well, with passing rates of 98% in SY 2019-2020 and 97% in SY 2020-2021. This highlighted the unfortunate reality that many qualified learners were unable to take the assessments due to financial constraints. DepEd emphasized that RA 11975 and RA 12116 include funding allocations to support the assessment of SHS-TVL learners and the issuance of NCs. This ensures that TESDA can conduct assessments at no cost to the students. RA 11975 also includes provisions to expand the pool of accredited competency assessors, facilitating the accreditation of additional assessors needed for the implementation of the SHS assessment and certification support programs. TESDA and DepEd will jointly oversee the selection and prioritization of eligible personnel in SHS institutions offering the TVL track. Further support is provided under RA 12116, specifically in the Development, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation of Assessment and Certification Systems. This provision aims to enhance accreditation efforts, including those for SHS assessment and certification. According to the latest DepEd order, the free assessments will be available to SHS-TVL learners currently enrolled in Grades 11 and 12 in both public and private schools. Alternative Learning System (ALS) learners under the SHS-TVL track, enrolled in public and private learning centers, will also be eligible. The initiative will cover SHS-TVL learners for SY 2024-2025 and SY 2025-2026, as well as SHS-TVL graduates and ALS graduates from SY 2022-2023 and SY 2023-2024. Additionally, beneficiaries of the Joint Delivery Voucher Program (JDVP) may avail of the free assessment, provided they have completed the required training for their desired qualification. DepEd and TESDA aim to increase certification rates among SHS-TVL learners, ensuring that more students receive the necessary credentials to enhance their employment opportunities and career prospects. — (FREEMAN)",

    "article_body": "The Philippine government followed due process in serving the International Criminal Court warrant to former president Rodrigo Duterte upon his arrival at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport last Tuesday, a justice official said. This included the reading of his Miranda rights and explanation of why he has being arrested, Justice Undersecretary Nicholas Felix Ty said. “Ibinigay talaga ang lahat ng palugit kay President Duterte at sa kanyang mga kasamahan. Ginalang namin ang kanyang lahat ng Karapatan bilang dating pangulo. Sa dulo, tahimik at tinanggap ang kalagayan na dapat talagang maipatupad ang warrant of arrest at maisakay siya sa eroplano papunta sa The Hague,” he said in a TeleRadyo Serbisyo interview. “Hindi pinwersa, hindi namin kinalimutan na siya ang dating pangulo, may edad na. Sinigurado namin na tahimik at marahan ang proseso.” ADVERTISEMENT “Hindi defiant ang dating pangulo. May mga abogado siya na ipinaglaban nila ang posisyon nila. Marami silang hiniling pero si President Duterte tahimik lang siya, tanggap niya ang pangyayari.” He rejected Vice President Sara Duterte’s claim that the arrest was a form of “state kidnapping.” He added Duterte can seek legal remedy with the ICC in The Hague after the court took jurisdiction of the former president. The ICC, based in The Hague, has said that there were \"reasonable grounds\" to believe Duterte committed the crime against humanity of murder as an \"indirect co-perpetrator\" during the anti-drug campaign that rights groups estimate killed tens of thousands of people. ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said Duterte’s arrest is an important moment for alleged victims of his \"war on drugs.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Vice President Sara Duterte should face her impeachment case just as her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, faced the charge against him before the International Criminal Court, according to a lawmaker. The Vice President went to the Netherlands after his father was arrested in Manila on Tuesday on an ICC warrant and was flown to The Hague. Vice President Duterte’s impeachment trial is seen to start on July 30 or more than four months from today. “Patungkol naman sa impeachment, medyo hindi pa naman ito nagsisimula, at naglabas din naman ng pahayag ang ating Pangalawang Pangulo na handa siyang harapin ang impeachment sa kanya. So, panghahawakan natin ‘yun, dahil naghahanap ang ating mga kababayan ng transparency at accountability,” House Assistant Majority Leader and Zambales 1st District Representative Jefferson Khonghun said. ADVERTISEMENT “So, dapat harapin ng ating pangalawang Pangulo ‘yung issue sa kanya na katulad ng pagharap ng kanyang ama sa mga issue sa ICC,” he added. House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers Party List Representative France Castro also hopes Vice President Duterte will appear in her impeachment trial. “Kay VP Sara Duterte… tama naman ang ginagawa mo na tulungan ang iyong tatay. Anyway, ‘yan talaga ang kultura natin bilang Pilipino. Pero as a government official, Vice President na mayroon ding kinakaharap na accountability sa ating mga mamayan, dapat harapin mo rin ‘yung impeachment complaint, at dumalo ka sa magiging impeachment trial in due time,” she said. House Assistant Majority Leader and Manila City 1st District Representative Ernesto Dionisio Jr., meanwhile, issued a reminder that the official online accounts of government agencies should not be used for personal matters. He issued the statement after the official Facebook page of the Office of the Vice President briefly changed its profile photo with one showing a ribbon with the message “Bring PRRD home”. “Minsan, lalo na ‘pag mainit ‘yung damdamin, we do things… abruptly. So, siguro that's one of the reasons why sa personal page niya, that's okay. Pero ‘pag doon sa pamahalaan, of course, kaya nga siguro tinanggal naman din nila agad. Of course, kapag government, official website, we should not use it on a personal capacity,” Dionisio said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) on Wednesday said it has spent about P210 million in the past two years for the detention of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) workers arrested since the crackdown began in 2023. The PAOCC spends about “P35 million every 4 months” for the food, water, electricity, security officials and administrative costs for POGO workers who are awaiting deportation, said spokesperson Winston Casio. “Roughly two years na po so we may have spent already...P210 million to end this problem,” he told Palace reporters. The Bureau of Immigration (BI) explained that the PAOCC had to shoulder some of its costs as their detention facility in Taguig could only house up to 100 foreign nationals for deportation. ADVERTISEMENT “Ang PAOCC napakalaki ng tulong (has been a great help) in terms of housing them prior to deportation,” BI spokesperson Dana Sandoval said. As of December 2024, the PAOCC has deported 2,121 foreign nationals working in illegal POGO hubs. Nearly 340 others are awaiting deportation, according to data from the agency. “This does not include those who voluntarily left the country,” Casio said. But, Casio said, PAOCC's expenses have to be seen in the context of property seized in its operations. “We could have already gained anywhere between P20 billion to P30 billion worth of real estate properties, tangible items, cars, name it,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT He said that Anti-Money Laundering Council has already ordered market valuation of seized items and properties. Among the seized properties from POGOs that are awaiting deposition are several high-value properties in Pasay City, a hotel in Cebu, mega compounds in Tarlac and Pampanga, as well as 134 seized vehicles, Casio said. Most of the POGO-linked foreign nationals who were either deported or awaiting deportation are from Vietnam, China, Indonesia and Myanmar, data from the BI showed. Immigration officials are also working with various embassies so that they could shoulder the repatriation flights of their respective nationals who were involved in illegal gambling operations here, the agency’s spokesperson said. Last year, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. banned all POGOs in the Philippines after congressional investigations and multiple raids showed that the industry was linked to several criminal activities including torture, prostitution and human trafficking. ADVERTISEMENT Since the ban took effect on January 1, 2025, only 11,000 of the 33,000 registered POGO workers have remained in the Philippines, according to data from the BI. Of the 11,254 POGO workers who stayed in the Philippines, 121 have been deported, 518 have been arrested, while 45 other voluntarily surrendered.",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- A child rights group on Monday urged President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. not to veto a bill meant to prevent teen pregnancies, saying he should read it carefully instead. This, after Marcos, Jr. slammed \"woke absurdities\" in the bill that supposedly seeks to teach children to masturbate and take away parents' authority over their offspring. But in a statement, Child Rights Network (CRN) Philippines – considered the largest alliance moving for child rights legislation in the country – said it was better if the President explained which parts of the bill were questionable to him. \"Comprehensive Sexuality Education or CSE is just one of its components and is just a reiteration of what is already in the RH Law and the Executive Order signed by former President Duterte in response to NEDA’s declaration of teen pregnancy as a national social emergency,\" said CRN Philippines in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT \"Kami ay umaasa na hindi niya ive-veto ang isang bill na naglalayong makapagtapos ng pag-aaral ang teen parents, matulungan sila at ang kanilang mga anak through health services, at mabigyan ng age-appropriate at culturally sensitive information ang mga bata at kabataan para mapigilan ang teen pregnancy,\" it added. For the group, what's important is that the President read the provisions in the bill thoroughly and carefully, as the proposed law underwent consultations with child rights organizations. \"Wala po sa bill ang sinasabi n’yong dahilan kung bakit ito ive-veto. This bill has undergone consultations with child rights organizations responsible for advocating laws that protect the Filipino children,\" the group said. The Comprehensive Sexuality Education recently became a center of discussion after lawmakers expressed concern on its implementation by the Department of Education as early as Kindergarten, and the Senate Bill No. 1979 or the proposed Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy Act. Sen. Risa Hontiveros, chair of one of the committees that prepared Senate Bill No. 1979, said that childhood masturbation was not part of the proposed legislation. Hontiveros earlier said critics of the bill were making false claims.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The House of Representatives has approved on second reading a bill seeking to expand the coverage of the government assistance to students in private education, to include all the years of basic education, from kindergarten to senior high school. During the House plenary session on Monday, House Bill 11214 or the proposed Private Basic Education Voucher Assistance Act was approved via viva voce or voice voting. “Presently, government assistance and subsidies are not extended to elementary education, but are confined to students in Grades 7 through 12, at the secondary level, where the challenges related to poor learning outcomes remain a significant challenge. Expanding the program to cover these earlier educational stages would help address these concerns and ensure more comprehensive support for students in need,” House Committee on Basic Education and Culture Chairperson and Pasig City Representative Roman Romulo said. “The program has played a significant role in alleviating overcrowding in public high schools,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT Under the amended version of the bill, the voucher assistance will be provided to students from middle income families as determined by the Philippine Statistics Authority, who attended public schools identified by the Department of Education as congested or those living in areas with congested public schools, or without a nearby public school, who wish to enroll in private basic education schools. Students, who are most vulnerable and underprivileged, shall receive a higher voucher amount as determined by the Basic Education Assistance Council or BEAC. Citing data from the Department of Education, Romulo said 398,930 students transferred from private to public schools at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Between 2020 and 2022, enrollment in public schools increased by 1.5 million students, while in private schools, it dropped by almost a million students.",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- Former Bayan Muna Rep. Teddy Casiño said Wednesday it will be \"easy\" to get the required number of votes in the House of Representatives to advance the impeachment complaints filed against Vice President Sara Duterte. The impeachment complaint needs one-third of the Congress or 105 votes for it to be forwarded to the Senate. \"Honestly, tingin ko madali 'yung 105... Ito'y dahil ilang buwan nang iniimbestigahan ng Kongreso ito e. Alam na alam na ng mga congressman 'yung mga pagkakamali at 'yung mga pagkukulang ng vice president,\" Casiño said in TeleRadyo Serbisyo's Johnson Ikwento Mo. \"So tingin namin, madali sila makagagawa ng desisyon. Of course, ang challenge nito ay sa Senado. Ang importante naman nito sa Senado ay magkakaroon pa ng trial 'yan... so tayo ay umaasa na kung magiging objective lamang at tapat ang mga senador, makukumbinsi sila na dapat ma-impeach ang vice president,\" he added. ADVERTISEMENT The former lawmaker, who is also the current chairperson of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN), said that the issue should not be seen through the lens of the politicians' alliances and parties but by their obligations to the public. \"Ano man ang kanilang partido o paniniwala, obligado ang mga congressman at senador na tingnan 'yung complaint, tingnan 'yung ebidensya, tingnan 'yung aming mga argumento na alam din ito ng buong publiko and, based on that, kailangan nilang magdesisyon batay sa kanilang konsensya at batay sa kanilang masusing pag-aaral ng ebidensiya,\" he said. When asked why they still filed an impeachment complaint despite President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s earlier discouragement on the matter, Casiño said it was a matter of holding the vice president accountable. \"'Yan po ay opinion ni President Marcos. Ang usapin naman dito ay hindi 'yung opinyon ng presidente. Ang usapin dito ay nagkamali ba o gumawa ba ng mga maling bagay ang vice president at paano siya pananagutin sa mga ginawa niya,\" he said. \"So for us it doesn't matter kung ang tingin ni President Marcos ay hindi dapat [mag-file.] Tingin namin, sa ilalim ng batas at Konstitusyon, may pananagutan ang vice president at kailangan niyang harapin ito,\" he continued. ADVERTISEMENT The vice president is already facing two impeachment complaints; the first was a civilian-drafted complaint filed last December 2, and the latest one was filed on December 4. The first impeachment complaint alleged Duterte committed \"culpable violations of the Constitution, graft and corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust, and other high crimes,\" all of which are grounds for impeachment. The second one, however, only revolves around how the vice president \"betrayed the public's trust.\"",

ADVERTISEMENT However, he said he could not tell what these specific “notable” programs are yet. “At this point of time I don’t have that information yet but I believe it will be far-reaching, wide-ranging subjects that both foreign ministers can discuss,” he said. Aside from the Malaysia Foreign Minister’s visit, there will be a series of events that will kickoff this year to show active relations between the two nations, one of which is the Malaysia International Halal Showcase (MIHAS) 2024 set to take place in September. Intan Zalani, MATRADE Trade Commissioner in Manila, said they are working with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to have Filipinos in MIHAS 2024. “We have been informed that a big possibility of the Philippines coming for the MIHAS to be part of the event as exhibitors. We are also looking to recruit more buyers to come to MIHAS to source for not only products from Malaysia but also Halal products from all over the world as well,” she said. “And we think that is also a good avenue for the Philippine halal exporters to promote in Malaysia because it is the biggest halal showcase the world,” she said. Zakaria, meanwhile, thanked the Philippines, especially the DTI who has been actively promoting and supporting the Halal Industry.",

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos received Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, who is currently in the Philippines for a short visit. During their meeting, Al Nahyan expressed the United Arab Emirates' gratitude to the Philippines for the contributions of the Filipinos in their country. According to a 2022 data of the Philippine Statistics Authority, the UAE is second only to Saudi Arabia as the leading destination of OFWs globally, and is currently home to 13.7 percent of the 1.96 million OFWs worldwide. \"My President… regards his gratitude to you sir, to the Philippines for how you've always been welcoming UAE, supportive to the UAE, and most of all how the Filipino people who have considered UAE as a second home have shown throughout those years not only dedication but love, and to you and the First Lady I would like to express our gratitude and appreciation,\" Al Nahyan said. ADVERTISEMENT The Philippine President thanked the UAE for the assistance and kindness it has extended to the Philippines and the Filipinos. \"And I hope that we are able to reciprocate somehow because we are very grateful for the assistance that you have done… especially to our Filipino nationals who are working in the Emirates... We extend that relationship further and make it deeper,\" he said. The Emirati official meanwhile said that while both countries have continued to grow over the years, there is still much to be done to improve it further, particularly on trade. \"Our relationship is growing, but not enough. We could do much better. It could be much better because I think we have an interest to further enhance it. But also the Philippines has shown that it's been welcoming investors, we would like to do more trade, and to finalize and sit down with the Philippines,\" he said. Also included in the meeting with Al Nahyan was Kathryna Yu-Pimentel, who took her oath Tuesday morning as Philippine Special Envoy to the UAE. Pimentel is the wife of Senator Aquilino \"Koko\" Pimentel. ADVERTISEMENT \"I am profoundly honored by the trust and confidence President Marcos has placed in me,\" said Pimentel. \"My mission is to help in the strengthening of our investment and trade relationship with the UAE.\" Pimentel has been active in various international forums on investment and economic cooperation hosted by UAE, including the World Government Summit in February 2024, United Nations Climate Change Conference or COP 28 last December 2023, Dubai Airshow and Dubai Watch Week in November 2023, Dubai Expo, and Techspo Dubai. \"With the upcoming 50th anniversary of our diplomatic ties this year, I hope to be able to contribute to the further strengthening of our relationship with the UAE as the President’s special envoy,\" Pimentel said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation had excess funds that totaled P89.9 billion from government allocations in the last three years, PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. confirmed before the House Committee on Appropriations on Monday. Of this amount, P27.1 billion was from 2021, P24 billion from 2022, and P38.8 billion from 2023. Lawmakers called out the “inaccurate estimates” for additional funding needed by PhilHealth for the period, and urged the state health insurer to either increase benefits or lower premium contribution rates. “Masasabi natin na error ito sa computation. Kasi kung tama ang pag-compute ng gobyerno ay hindi tayo magkakaroon ng excess funds. Ibig sabihin kung tama ang pag anticipate ng gagastusin para sa ating indigent households, para sa seniors, para sa PWD, at kayang-kaya naman itong ma-estimate, ay magiging tama sana ang isisingil sa gobyerno taun-taon,” House Committee on Appropriations Vice Chairperson and Marikina 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo said. ADVERTISEMENT “There were a lot of duplications and the senior citizens, who apparently were either paying for their own premium or were still working, or ‘yung sumakabilang buhay na. In other words, there was an estimated 7.7 million na hiningian ng pondo. But what was validated was more or less around 5 million,” Iloilo 1st District Representative and Former Health Secretary Janette Garin. “Under the law, may dalawang courses of action ang PhilHealth, the first is pwede kayo mag-expand ng benefits. The second is pwede kayo magbaba ng kinokolekta sa kanila,” Quimbo told PhilHealth. “We are aggressively enhancing our benefits packages,” PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. assured congressmen. Lawmakers also questioned PhilHealth’s exorbitant package for COVID testing, which was at P8,150 in the early parts of 2020. Garin said it was higher than the P2,000 to P2,500 range set by the World Health Organization. Former Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that test kits were of limited supply and global demand was high during the initial stages of the COVID pandemic, but noted that PhilHealth’s COVID test package eventually went down as the supply of test kits stabilized. ADVERTISEMENT “The issue here is the price. PhilHealth was paying P8,150 per COVID testing at ‘yun ang naging benchmark, kaya lahat ng private laboratories including government labs ay tinaga ang mga pasyente,” Garin said. “During the initial stage of pandemic, where there was scarce supply of test kits, the testing cost was clearly very high, but as soon as time went by and supplies and prices started to stabilize, then DOH with PhilHealth started to make corresponding adjustments. So they started to reformulate the testing fees, so that pababa nang pababa,” Duque replied. “It was really difficult. Everybody was scrambling for supplies. The whole world suffered from global supply chain shortage. This affected even the formulation of testing fees. You would see the downward trajectory of the testing cost as soon as the supplies became available and prices became stabilized,” he added. The Philippines, at the height of the pandemic, also entered into loan agreements with foreign financial institutions for $2.21 billion, which had a commitment fee of P162 million. But the government later decided to cancel the agreement for loans amounting to $800 million.",

This is to spare students from learning under the current system which was labelled by international assessments as \"ineffective.\" The congressman from the lone district of Pasig City, who is also the chair of the House Committee on Basic Education and Culture, said that DepEd should stop doing pilot implementation and installment of the \"MATATAG Curriculum.\" This adjusted K to 10 curriculum seeks to address issues in the current education system including the congestion of content. It was piloted on academic year 2023-2024 in hand picked schools and selected grade levels only. ADVERTISEMENT The formal implementation will be done in phases beginning school year 2024 to 2025 with grade levels participating in batches until school year 2027-2028. Kindergarten, Grades 1, 4 and 7 will be the first to implement the curriculum next school year to be followed by Grades 2, 5 and 8 on academic year 2025-2026. Grades 3, 6 and 9 will begin its shift only on school year 2026-2027 while Grade 10 will be the last to roll out the curriculum on school year 2027-2028 \"Ang sinasabi ko sa DepEd, tama ang MATATAG curriculum pero sa totoo, tama na ang pilot ng pilot lang. You have to implement it,\" stressed Romulo. \"Ang tanong ko, kung gradual po iyan, papaano ang mga estudyante natin na hindi kasama [sa bawat taon]? So ibig sabihin they will go through the same system kung saan ipinapakita na satin ng international assessments na hindi nga ito effective,\" he also said. ADVERTISEMENT Romulo called on DepEd to revise its manner of implementation of the curriculum. \"Sana i-implement natin ito ng mas mabilis at i-implement natin na mas maayos,\" he said. DepEd, for its part, explained the need to implement the curriculum in phases. \"The design of the new curriculum is progressive at every entry level per key stage (Grades 1, 4, 7) meaning may [there are] prerequisite skills/competencies at each entry level that need to be mastered before they progress to the next grade level,\" Assistant Secretary Francis Bringas told ABS-CBN News. The MATATAG curriculum was finalized after two years of review on learning competencies and subjects of students. ADVERTISEMENT While it was launched during the term of Vice President Sara Duterte, the review started during the time of her predecessor, former Secretary Leonor Briones, after learning the “alarming poor performance learners in national and international assessments.\"",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants a stricter limit on interest rates imposed by financing and lending companies. Under its draft memorandum circular, the SEC wants the maximum nominal interest rate fixed at 6 percent per month, or about 0.2 percent per day. The effective interest rate will be capped at 10 percent per month, or about 0.33 percent per day, including the nominal interest rate and all other applicable fees, like processing fees, service fees, notarial fees, handling fees, and verification fees. But this excludes penalties for late and non-payment of outstanding scheduled amounts due. ADVERTISEMENT Lending and financing companies may only charge penalties of up to 5 percent per month for late payment or non-payment on outstanding amounts due. Lending companies that break this rule will be fined P25,000 for the first offense, and P50,000 for the second offense. Financing companies, meanwhile, will be fined P50,000 for the first offense and P100,000 for the second offense. On the third offense, the SEC may impose a fine equivalent to at least twice the penalty for the second offense, but not more than P1 million. The company’s financing and lending activities may also be suspended for 60 days, and its secondary license may be revoked. ADVERTISEMENT If the offense is grave, the SEC may also suspend or revoke the company’s primary registration. The securities regulator is seeking public comments on the draft circular until November 14. SEC said it is doing this to strike a balance between consumer protection and the competitiveness of duly licensed lending and financing companies. “The number of borrowers struggling under excessive interest rates has continued to grow in recent years, as certain entities exploit the accessibility of online lending applications to trap our fellow kababayans in cycles of debt,” chairperson Francis Lim said. The SEC has been cracking down on online lending apps. ADVERTISEMENT In May, it revoked the corporate registration and financing license of Digido after it opened and operated four branches without obtaining a certificate of authority. In the same month, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of MagicPeso over abusive collection practices. It also filed criminal complaints against the operator of online lending app Easypeso for abusive collection practices. Earlier in October, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of online lending platforms Credit Cash and Credit Peso over unfair debt collection practices. The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission has monitored some 300 online lending apps, many of which are bogus. Some bogus lenders even go so far as to issue rape or death threats to borrowers so they would pay up. Authorities, however, are facing a blank wall in going after abusive lending apps since the companies simply discard these preregistered SIM cards after promoting their services or threatening their borrowers.",

The NIA is pushing to build 10 dams this year, as well as 50 medium and 3 high dams by the end of Marcos Jr.’s term, said NIA administrator Eduardo Guillen. “Ang gusto ng ating pangulo ay mag shift tayo from flood control to water management,” he said in a press conference in Malacañang. “Kaya tayo nagkakaproblema ay yung mga malalaking dam na inaasahan natin ngayon… tinayo ito 50 years ago… Unfortunately, hindi na natin yan sinundan ng mga ganitong proyekto,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Ang gusto ng ating pangulo ngayon ay magtayo ng high dams,” he added, noting that these can also be used as in flood control, irrigation, hydro power, aquaculture, floating solar and tourism efforts. The NIA has crafted a design and build manual to quicken the construction of these dams, Guillen said. “Masho-shorten niya yung implementation ng dam from conception to actual construction by 3 years,” he said. Guillen also told reporters that despite the El Niño phenomenon, corn production increased by 5.9 percent, while rice production improved by 1.1 percent. So far, only 1 percent of farmlands were not irrigated, he said, saying these are the “tail-ends” of the irrigation lines. Last year, the Senate questioned the NIA’s failure to finish projects on time, including a dam in Tarlac that was supposed to provide irrigation for 34,000 hectares in 10 municipalities, to benefit 23,000 farmers. NIA told senators the project has been terminated with its former contractor.",

    "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) -- Nine Filipino crew members of an oil tanker seized by Iran's navy in the Gulf of Oman arrived in the Philippines on Sunday. Lord Rangasajo, one of the crew members who arrived, said they had positive interactions with the Iranians. \"Maganda naman po ang pakikiharap ng mga Iranian sa amin. Wala naman po kaming naging problema,\" he said. He also mentioned that they were not harassed. ADVERTISEMENT \"Mga eight commandos, they boarded us with the heavy guns but okay naman sila,\" he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs revealed that two more are expected to return this week. \"'Yung dalawang aalis pa, Tuesday or Wednesday aalis sila,\" DFA Usec. Eduardo de Vega said. (Two more will depart on Tuesday or Wednesday.) The remaining six are awaiting replacements before returning to the Philippines. ADVERTISEMENT \"Hindi naman sila hostage per se, kasi kusang loob silang naiwan doon dahil binigyan ng double salary kaya out of their own free will sila na naiwan doon,\" he said. (They are not hostages per se because they willingly stayed there due to the double salary offered, so they chose to remain voluntarily.) In an interview on Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon on Monday, De Vega said the crew are healthy and happy to be back in the country. The nine seafarers were able to return after they were replaced by Russian counterparts. “Ang kailangan na lang diyan mapalitan sila ng ibang crew men. Kasi ang sabi ng port authority sa Iran at saka ng manning agency, puwede namang umuwi kahit sino basta palitan sila kasi kailangan nagpapatakbo ng barko. Originally naisip nila Filipino rin ang kukunin eh hindi bakit kukuha eh di pareho din magkakaroon pa ng mga Filipinong ipit doon. Kaya ang sabi namin dapat ibang bansa,” De Vega explained. ADVERTISEMENT (What is needed is for them to be replaced by other crew men. The port authority in Iran and the manning agency said anyone can come home so long as they are replaced because a ship operator is needed. What they originally thought was to get other Filipinos but that would put them in a pickle as well. That’s why we said it should be another nationality.) “‘Yung sahod nila tuloy pa, binabayaran sila ng manning agency pero ang pagbayad dito sa pamilya dito sa Pilipinas. At ang sabi ng Department of Migrant Workers, ang nakikipag-ugnayan sa manning agency, pinaakyat pa nga ang suweldo,” De Vega said. (They continued to receive their salary, but this was paid to their family here in the Philippines. The Department of Migrant Workers who is coordinating with the manning agency, said the pay was actually increased.) The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) assured they are ready to provide psychocounseling to arriving seafarers, along with financial assistance accommodation, and air fare if they need to return to their provinces. \"Kakausapin po muna natin sila kung magdecide sila na magse-settle sila rito sa Pilipinas then we will provide reintegration sa kanila,\" OWWA Deputy Administrator Atty. Honey Quiño said. ADVERTISEMENT (We will first discuss with them if they decide to settle in the Philippines, and then we will provide reintegration support.) The Filipino crew members were under Iran's custody following the Iranian Navy's seizure of the oil tanker St. Nikolas in the Gulf of Oman in January. Iran's action was a retaliatory response to the confiscation of Iranian crude oil from the same vessel by US forces in 2023. -- With a report from Victoria Tulad, ABS-CBN News.",

    "article_body": "The first phase of the 25-kilometer Pasig River esplanade recently opened to the public, offering a brightly lit recreational space where people could take strolls. The development is open to the public from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., authorities earlier said. The project will eventually include jogging paths, bike lanes and commercial areas with retail stores and cafes. Once the promenade is completed, it is expected to traverse 5 cities, giving the public a “major transportation lane that will cut across local governments of the National Capital Region,” said Undersecretary Avelino Tolentino III of the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DSHUD). ADVERTISEMENT To aid in the clean-up of the Pasig River, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is also adding trash skimmers which prevent floating debris and garbage from flowing along the river. It has also started recycling water hyacinths and water lilies to make charcoals briquettes and lily pots. All plans to rehabilitate and develop the Pasig River to make it a tourist attraction is expected to be completed within the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the MMDA said. Last week, Marcos said the rehabilitation of the Pasig River would be a “people-centered, community-driven development” instead of a mere “cosmetic” project. Informal settlers who will be affected by the project will not be displaced, as housing units will be built within the city where these families reside, the MMDA had said. The DHSUD earlier said the P18 billion needed to establish the mixed-use riverside park would be sourced from the private sector. — With reports from Joyce Balancio and Katrina Domingo, ABS-CBN News",

    "date_published": "2024-01-26T02:45:13+00:00",
    "article_body": "Three Land Transportation Office employees were arrested Thursday after they were caught stealing license plates from the agency’s plate making plant in Quezon City. LTO Chief Assistant Secretary Atty. Vigor D. Mendoza II identified the 3 as embossers Jenard Arida and Arjay Anasco; and warehouse staff Valeriano Nerizon, all assigned to the plate making plant at the LTO Central Office in Quezon City. Mendoza also ordered a manhunt against Allan Joker Abrigo, another LTO employee who served as team leader and possibly the boss of the three arrested suspects. \"Gaya ng ipinangako natin sa taumbayan, we will not tolerate this kind of illegal activity and we will make sure that those who would dare to continue with their wrongdoings will be caught and held responsible. The arrest of these three people is proof of that,\" the LTO chief said. The investigation started after the LTO Intelligence and Investigation Division led by Renante G. Militante received information last year about possible theft of license plates. The investigation showed the three suspects were allegedly threatening their co-workers in the plate making plant if they would spill the beans on their modus. On Jan. 25, Militante was tipped that the three were again doing illegal activity, prompting him to contact Police Col. Bernard Yang, Senior Police Assistant to Interior and Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos. A PNP operation led to the arrest of the three suspects while sneaking out five pieces of license plates out of the plant Thursday noon. “Based on the result of the investigation, they are selling the license plates at P10,000 per piece. We are now trying to determine how long and how many license plates have been stolen by these errant employees,” said Mendoza. \"There is a syndicate behind these people involved in carnapping, smuggling and other serious crimes. We will run after the mastermind and the buyers. It appears na matagal na itong embedded at the LTO. More employees will be investigated as part of our weeding out of scalawags,\" he added. The suspects are now detained and are facing charges of Violation of Article 310 (Qualified Theft) and Article 294 (Robbery) of the Revised Penal Code. They will also face administrative charges. Technical Carnapping Based on the investigation, the 3 are being linked to a scheme involving newly-acquired motor vehicles through financing. The modus starts with a leader or a financier who will acquire a vehicle through financing and will illegally sell the vehicle using duplicated plates and fake OR/CR. The financier then procures the \"fake\" plates from his contact inside LTO at P20,000 per pair. ADVERTISEMENT",

    "article_body": "Senator Sherwin Gatchalian urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Friday to use his executive powers to shut down Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). “I am hoping that the President, through his executive power, already to start to whine down and eventually ban POGO. It’s causing us, not only social harm, but yung budget natin kinakain na rin,” Gatchalian said. The Philippine government has spent public funds to feed detained foreign POGO workers while processing their deportation proceedings and eventually, by loading them to the plane as deportees. “Imagine mo 200 ang dino-document nila, marami dun peke pa pangalan... tapos pagkain nila. Kasi kahit na dine-deport natin sila, we have to treat them like a human being and with dignity. Again, magastos yan and again wala namang naidudulot sa atin, bakit pa natin kailangang ipagpatuloy.” Gatchalian said. ADVERTISEMENT Gatchalian made a call while underlining his belief that unscrupulous POGO players and syndicates behind them continue to commit crimes in the country. “It’s not because tahimik ngayon ang POGO does not mean that there’s no crime happening,” said Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Gatchalian made the call a week after Congress marked the start of its Christmas break, leaving his POGO committee report’s recommendation to ban it in the Philippines, untouched. He also gave the President a copy of his report. While visiting Mindoro province, he said that Rep. Alfonso Umali told him that kidnapping activities in the province targeting Filipino-Chinese are becoming rampant. ADVERTISEMENT “He showed he showed me a video na mga local Chinese kinkidnap at tino-torture,” Gatchalian said. Aside from appealing to the President, Gatchalian vowed to talk to Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri regarding the need to discuss his committee report on the floor. “We will continue to push. It’s already filed in the Senate. I just need to talk to the leadership on how to go about.. as long as POGO is allowed, we are allowing criminal syndicates to come in to our country,” the senator pointed out. “Magiging tahanan tayo ng mga criminal syndicates from China operating here,” he stressed. POGOs’ continued operations, coupled with the government’s plan to give Chinese tourists a “visa free” or “visa upon entry” arrangement are grave danger for the country, Gatchalian said. ADVERTISEMENT “Eh ngayon nga may POGO problem tayo nakakapasok sila ng madali, just imagine giving them visa free. It’s like a license for criminal syndicates to operate here in the Philippines. So, as long as POGO is here, it’s impossible to increase tourism coming from China because nahahaluan ng criminal syndicates coming to the Philippines,” he added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The government remains firm in its stand not to extend the deadline for the consolidation of operators to comply with the jeepney modernization program. Transportation Undersecretary Timothy John Batan on Tuesday said there will be no more extension beyond the December 31 due date, despite appeals from drivers and operators to give them more time to comply with the policy. However, many jeepney drivers and operators remain hesitant to join a cooperative or corporation. Under a cooperative, an operator will lose ownership of his unit as this will now form part of the asset of the group that formed the juridical entity. A driver interviewed by ABS-CBN said his job as a driver is now hanging in the balance, 3 days before the last office day of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for this year. Another driver and jeepney operator, meanwhile, said he is not willing to give up ownership of his unit which he bought for P90,000. HOPE AND APPEAL Transport group Piston remains hopeful that a temporary restraining order [TRO] will be issued by the Supreme Court after it brought the issue to the highest court. Manibela, on the other hand, appealed for compassion from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for the plight of drivers and operators who will lose their livelihood once the LTFRB suspends their operation come January 2024. Manibela said there are still around 40,000 traditional jeepney units that have yet to join the consolidation. When asked about the veracity of the figure, the Department of Transportation said they cannot yet dispute it, pending the LTFRB updating its record. But the DOTr said the LTFRB will issue special permits to plug the expected shortage of jeepneys in several routes in Metro Manila. Dispatching buses will be an option to ferry more passengers who are going to be affected by the shortage of traditional jeepneys, in case the impasse between Manibela/Piston and LTFRB is not resolved, the transport department said.",

Currently, there are 8 groups who showed interest and have bought bid documents. Bautista said though the December 27 deadline is still over a month away, that might be a short time if a new group wants to join the bidding for the rehabilitation, operation and expansion of NAIA. “It will take time for them to do the due diligence to study. It will take longer time to prepare the proposal,” said Bautista. He added that he met one-on-one some of the groups and so far, their plans and proposals appear to be viable. The eight prospective bidders who bought bid documents are: GMR Airports International B.V., San Miguel Holdings Corp., Manila International Airport Consortium, Spark 888 Management, Inc, Asian Airport Consortium, Cengiz Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., Incheon International Airport Corporation, and Limak Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. Bautista also commented on the statement of Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla on co-branding Sangley airport with NAIA. Bautista said it needs to be studied by experts since it’s a new concept. “Kailangan review-hin technically, kung possible although yung runway niya [Sangley], yung orientation ay halos pareho [sa NAIA],\" he said. The winning bidder of the P170 billion project is expected to be announced in the first quarter of next year. The winning bidder will be given 15 years to rehabilitate the airport’s passenger terminals and airside facilities. The deal may be extended for another 10 years if NAIA improvement targets are met.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The grant of bail to former Sen. Leila de Lima after nearly 7 years of detention is a \"testament\" to the Philippine judiciary's \"independence,\" according to Sen. Imee Marcos. Muntinlupa RTC Branch 206 Judge Gener Gito allowed De Lima to post bail in the last drug case against her. It was a reversal of a denial by another judge in June of her petition for bail. \"The independence of the judiciary is present and true. Our court is a court of law and justice, oblivious of personalities or any political noise. Sen. De Lima’s bail yesterday was a testament to that,\" the senator said. Making a similar comment on Monday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the grant of bail showed that courts are independent and \"that democracy is alive and well in our country.\" ADVERTISEMENT De Lima had long insisted the charges were fabricated in retaliation for her investigation into then-President Rodrigo Duterte' war on drugs, which is now subject of an investigation at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Asked on ANC's \"Headstart\" whether bail would have been imaginable while Duterte was president, De Lima lawyer Bonifacio Tacardon said, \"Based on our experience in Criminal Case No. [17-165], I think my answer to that question will be in the negative.\" He said that bail in that case was denied \"despite our confidence that evidence against our client was not strong.\" Tacardon added De Lima's legal team \"really felt pressure from all over with respect to that criminal case.\" De Lima was acquitted in Criminal Case No. 17-165 in May. ADVERTISEMENT In a separate interview on TeleRadyo Serbisyo, Dino De Leon — De Lima's spokesperson and a member of her legal team — said the former senator was \"politically attacked every step of the way, her reputation was destroyed by an organized machinery of the state.\" De Lima, who is facing the last of three drug cases filed against her during the Duterte administration, was accused of taking money from inmates inside the Bilibid. Several witnesses died or recanted their testimonies, resulting in the dismissal of two of the three charges against de Lima. She still faces life in prison if convicted on the remaining charge. Sen. Marcos said the grant of bail showed there was no need for the ICC to get involved in drug war cases. \"[ICC] has no business meddling with our justice system,\" Sen. Marcos said. ADVERTISEMENT The International Criminal Court is meant to be a court of last resort, for when national authorities are unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute cases like the alleged crimes against humanity in the war on drugs. Human rights groups and advocates for drug war victims say domestic processes have failed to provide accountability and justice in the deaths. The ICC in July ruled that it would proceed with its investigation on the killings during Duterte's drug war, denying the Philippine government's appeal on the contrary.",

The proposed measure mandates the Department of Information and Communications Technology to prepare a National ICT Plan, which will assess the needs of every province and identify the number of hubs to be developed there. Under the bill, every province shall have at least one ICT hub based on the type of activity it hosts -- from data farms to IT and business processing management, cyberskills learning hub and digital transformation center, and digital innovation hub, among others. “ICT hubs shall be developed in geographically equitable locations throughout the province,” the bill stated. ADVERTISEMENT “Any registered business enterprise in the ICT hub may be granted incentives, according to the performance-based, targeted, time-bound and transparent incentives program under… the CREATE law,” it added. “All ICT hubs established under this Act are hereby declared free zones within which any PTE may operate,” the bill noted. The measure further proposes that a digital network infrastructure be established to connect the local ICT hubs to the National Broadband Program though a core backbone network of the DICT, to be funded from the spectrum users’ fees.",

    "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATE) — The Department of Justice (DOJ) is now the government's legal representative in the Supreme Court (SC) case questioning the arrest and transfer of former President Rodrigo Duterte to the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC). Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla confirmed the DOJ has already submitted its comment on the petitions for habeas corpus filed by Davao City 1st District Rep. Paolo Duterte, Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte and Veronica Duterte. “We were given authorization by the Executive Secretary to, kami na ang sumagot, OK na, nabigay na namin ang comment namin kahapon,” Remulla said on Tuesday. This, after the Office of Solicitor General (OSG), the government's default lawyer, opted out of the case, citing conflict in previous positions. ADVERTISEMENT “Considering the OSG's firm position that the ICC is barred from exercising jurisdiction over the Philippines... the OSG may not be able to effectively represent Respondents in these cases and is constrained to recuse itself from participating herein,” Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said in his motion filed Monday. Duterte was arrested Tuesday last week after the Interpol served the arrest warrant issued by the ICC. He was sent to The Hague, Netherlands on the same day. President Marcos said the Philippine government cooperated with the Interpol and not with the ICC in delivering Duterte to The Hague. Asked if it is still possible to ask the International Criminal Court to bring back Duterte to the Philippines, Remulla said that might not be possible. “Wala na iyon, tapos na iyon, it’s a done deal already,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Remulla refused to divulge the details of the arguments they presented to the court. “Hayaan na natin, iyong dokumentong binigay namin sapat na iyon para sagutin ang mga sinabi nila sa korte,” Remulla said. Meantime, Remulla refused to comment on Guevarra’s recusal to represent the government before the Supreme Court. “I will not speak about the comment because it is with the court right now,” Remulla said. Former Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio said Marcos should consider firing Guevarra over his refusal to defend the government in the Duterte case.",

This batch is composed of four families, including 14 Filipinos and their six Palestinian spouses. They were welcomed by officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Overseas Workers Welfare Association, Department of Social Welfare and Development, and the Department of Health. Ravelina Cargullo was among those who arrived. She shared how the deteriorating situation in Gaza led them to flee, saying, “Pag pinapasabog po kami sa gabi tumatakbo kaming mag-iina malapit sa wall para mag umpok-umpukan lang po.” Ravelina recounted the hardships she and her family faced due to the Israel-Hamas war, including the lack of water and electricity. “Wala kaming kuryente, wala po kaming tubig. Almost one month sumasandok lang kami sa ilalim ng bahay ng isang building na tinitirhan namin. Doon kami kumukuha,” she said. According to DFA Assistant Secretary Robert Ferrer, upon their arrival, the families went through debriefing sessions to address the trauma they experienced. “May crisis management ang DSWD dito so we have trained psychologists, trained people,” Asec. Ferrer said. Ferrer emphasized that those with families or relatives in the country will be permitted to come home, while those without will be presented with various options through a government program. “Those who have not any connection with the country like wala sila kamag-anak, we will connect them with their LGUs, with their relatives here,” he said. “'Yung wala, we have already informed DSWD and the other agencies about it and we are having an inter-agency process.” Ferrer admitted there are still Filipinos who opted to stay in Gaza despite the volatile situation. “Their own decision po 'yun but we are asking them to change their mind and go home na lang,” Ferrer said. ADVERTISEMENT As of Tuesday, there are a total of 89 Filipinos and their 14 Palestinian spouses who have returned home to the Philippines. A fourth batch of evacuees is expected to arrive Wednesday.",

ADVERTISEMENT “On behalf of the Philippine government, we extend our sincerest thanks to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for this compassionate act,” he added. The Philippine Embassy in the UAE and the Consulate General in Dubai on Saturday called the grant of royal clemency a “benevolent act, which further strengthens the longstanding bonds of friendship and cooperation” between the two countries. Last year, 143 Filipinos received a pardon for their crimes in the UAE in time for Eid Al-Adha, while 220 others were given the same reprieve to mark the Middle Eastern country’s national day. Of the 2.16 million registered overseas Filipino workers in 2023, 13.6 percent are based in the UAE, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The chief of the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group admitted Thursday that he denied Vice President Sara Duterte entry into Villamor Air Base before her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was brought to The Hague this week. CIDG chief MGen. Nicolas Torre noted that the elder Duterte was already with his lawyers at that time. \"Bakit kailangang dagdagan pa ang gulo?\" said Torre, who acted as ground commander during Duterte's arrest. Torre headed the Davao regional police before serving as CIDG chief. He also led the two-week operation to arrest controversial religious leader Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, a close ally of the Dutertes. ADVERTISEMENT Vice President Duterte said her father's arrest was an affront to the country's sovereignty and described it as \"state kidnapping.\" The Marcos administration rejected this allegation, saying the arrest was lawful because of an existing International Criminal Court warrant that was coursed through the International Criminal Police Organization or Interpol, of which the country is a member. Duterte insisted that the ICC lacked jurisdiction over the Philippines and the former president because of the withdrawal of the Philippines from the Rome Statute in 2019. The International Criminal Court took ex-President Duterte into custody Wednesday to face charges over his war on drugs. The ICC, based in The Hague, believes there are \"reasonable grounds\" to charge Duterte with murder as a crime against humanity, as an \"indirect co-perpetrator\" during the anti-drug campaign that rights groups estimate killed tens of thousands. ADVERTISEMENT \"I am the one who led our law enforcement and military. I said that I will protect you and I will be responsible for all of this,\" Duterte said in a video posted to his and a close advisor's Facebook pages. \"I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible,\" said the 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state to appear before the ICC. A spokesman confirmed Duterte was in court custody after he arrived in Rotterdam by private jet. A vehicle thought to be carrying Duterte drove into the ICC detention center in The Hague past a crowd of dozens of supporters, some shouting: \"Bring him back\" and waving national flags. Duterte will be held there until an initial court appearance, likely in the coming days.",

(PhilHealth) promised accountability in the state insurer's ranks in response to a Supreme Court magistrate who said an overhaul is needed in light of its budget issues. During the third day of oral arguments on Tuesday, March 4, regarding the controversial transfer of P89.9-billion in excess PhilHealth reserve funds to the national treasury, Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Kho Jr. said it may be time to revamp the PhilHealth board \"for not complying with what the law requires\" in requesting its budget from Congress. PhilHealth president and CEO Edwin Mercado, who assumed office last month noted the 'dedication' of the members of the board. \"Nakikita ko naman po ang dedikasyon ng ating board members. Bagamat ganoon po eh lahat naman po kami dito maging ako man po ay ina-assess po regularly ang performance,\" Mercado said in a television interview Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT (I can see the board members' dedication. Our performance is assessed regularly, even mine) He said the PhilHealth board under his leadership will be \"metrics driven\" and will have accountability. The transfer of supposedly excess funds has raised questions on why PhilHealth had them and did not use them to benefit members, and whether the money could legally be transferred for use for other government projects. The state insurer also said that PhilHealth will abide with \"whatever the decision of the Supreme Court\" on the P60-billion fund already transferred to the national treasury. Kho, in the same oral arguments, said PhilHealth must urge President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to release an order reverting the transferred “excess funds” to PhilHealth to be used in expanding its benefit packages and improving services. ADVERTISEMENT \"Kami ho ay naniniwala na patas po ang proseso, ito po ay pinakikinggan ng talaga pong mga mahistradong sanay po at bihasa dito sa ating mga batas. Kung ano po ang desisyon ng ating kataas-taasang hukuman, kami po ay mag-a-abide, kami po ay susunod,\" Mercado stated.

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Philippine Navy is preparing for the possible occupation of two islands in Subic Bay once these are declared as military reservations. Grande Island and Chiquita Island are located at the southern entrance of Subic Bay, which was once a United States military base until the Philippine Senate rejected a lease extension in 1991. The facility has since been transformed into a freeport zone. “The thrust right now of the Philippine Navy is to prepare for the eventual occupation or preparation of the land that will be awarded through a presidential proclamation declaring part of SBMA [Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority] and Grande Island and Chiquita Island as military reservations,” Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad, PN spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, told reporters at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT According to Trinidad, Grande Island and Chiquita Island need to be declared as military reservations due to their proximity to Subic Bay — its “natural layout” providing safe harbor for Navy ships using the waterway. There is also an existing runway in Subic Bay, which can be used by Philippine aircraft. “Hence, the need to be able to have a military presence, a foothold in the Subic area,” Trinidad said. But the official clarified that the move to turn the two islands into military reservations has nothing to do with the arrest of six foreign nationals and two Filipinos found conducting illegal activities on Grande Island on March 19. “The foreign nationals that were arrested on Grande Island were there even before the talks of having that as a naval reservation. Nauna sila doon bago lumabas yung news na gagawing naval reservation ang part of Subic Bay,” Trinidad noted. ADVERTISEMENT Authorities nabbed five Chinese, a Cambodian and two Filipinos on the island last week due to suspected espionage and kidnapping activities related to Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs). In a statement released on March 20, the Department of National Defense (DND) said converting Grande Island and Chiquita Island would enhance security for the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, including the Riviera Wharf and the Subic Bay International Airport. It added that the planned conversion aligns with the \"ongoing development of the naval operating base of the PN to strengthen and maintain our strategic presence along our western seaboard.\" Grande Island is a strategic vantage point with a clear view of key sea lanes in the West Philippine Sea, including Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Transport group Manibela on Tuesday called on passengers to join a protest against the PUV modernization program's franchise consolidation requirement, which they said could take thousands of traditional jeepneys off the roads by January. The PUV modernization program requires jeepney operators to consolidate individual franchises into a single franchise under a cooperative or corporation by December 31, 2023. Failure to do so could revoke their permits to operate, authorities earlier said. Manibela estimates that around 40,000 jeepneys have yet to comply with the requirement. \"Malaki pa rin po ang kawalan nito na masasakyan ng ating mga kababayan,\" the group's leader, Mar Valbuena, told TeleRadyo Serbisyo. ADVERTISEMENT He said they have yet to receive any feedback from authorities on their bid to move the deadline, leaving drivers no other choice but to wait for the Supreme Court to act on their petition to block the franchise consolidation. \"Hindi po kami nawawalan ng pag-asa… Maghihintay po tayo,\" he said of their petition. But if the Supreme Court rejects their petition, Valbuena said, \"Wala po tayong magagawa doon kundi protesta talaga ang kailangan nating iparamdam, baka mas malaki pang protesta ang kailangan nating ipakita sa gobyerno.\" \"Baka sakaling ang commuters, sumama na sa atin sa pagpoprotesta,\" he added. \"Sana ang puso ng ating Pangulo ay haplusin nawa po ng ating Panginoon na magkaroon siya ng puso sa ating drivers, operators, lahat po ng maapektuhan nito. Domino effect po ang mangyayari dito,\" Valbuena said. ADVERTISEMENT \"At sana kasama na ang Supreme Court… yung mga mahistrado po natin ay pumabor at makita na yung petition ng ating mga kasamahan ay talaga namang hindi handa ang ating gobyerno. Sana walang sapilitan at magpatuloy po ang aning hanapbuhay,\" he said. Another transport group, Piston, said it was studying whether it would continue plying roads after the Dec. 31 deadline. It is also considering bringing its protest to the gates of Malacañang. \"Pinag-aaralan po natin at lagi naman po tayong bukas na posible talaga itong umabot sa kampohan sa labas ng Malakanyang,\" Piston president Mody Floranda said in a separate TeleRadyo Serbisyon interview. Jeepney drivers and operators have said \"modern jeepneys\" are too expensive and will deprive single-unit operators of route franchises that will then go to big corporations and to transport cooperatives. Some drivers and operators have argued that upgrading existing jeepneys will be a less expensive way to make them more fuel efficient and environment friendly. ADVERTISEMENT But the transport department said forming a cooperative would allow operators easier access to funds, especially when applying for loans for the modern jeepneys. The franchise consolidation deadline has been extended six times since 2020, noted Transport Undersecretary Timothy John Batan. He said 30 percent of in Metro Manila PUVs have complied with the required as of November. Authorities are still consolidating the latest figures for December, he said. Regulators will issue special permits for routes that might see fewer jeepneys in January if drivers fail to consolidate and their franchises are be revoked, added the official.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The United States reaffirmed its \"ironclad commitment\" to the Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines during the landmark visit of US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to Manila on Friday. Hegseth met with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. in Malacañang where he emphasized that the Trump administration is committed to the country’s alliance and partnership with the Philippines. “I had a chance to speak just a few minutes ago to our president, President [Donald] Trump, who sends his regards to you as well, thinks very fondly of this great country, is very committed to the alliance that we have, to the friendship that we have, the cooperation that we have,” Hegseth said. “And he and I both want to express the ironclad commitment we have to the mutual defense treaty and to the partnership, economically, militarily, which our staffs have worked on diligently for weeks and weeks and months,” he continued. ADVERTISEMENT “There is a very real reason why our first trip and our first visit is here to visit you in your great country.” The US Defense chief expressed the United States’ interest in further expanding military cooperation with the Philippines, which he says is critically important amid \"threats\" posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region. He also noted the importance of deterrence and for allies to stand “shoulder-to-shoulder” to ensure peace and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. “Peace through strength is a very real thing. Deterrence is necessary around the world, but specifically in this region, in your country, considering the threats from the Communist Chinese and that friends need to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to deter conflict, to ensure that there's free navigation,” Hegseth said. Marcos meanwhile emphasized the Philippines’ longstanding alliance with the United States, as well as the critical role of the US in ensuring peace in the Indo-Pacific region as he welcomed Hegseth to Manila. ADVERTISEMENT “Your visit to the region, and especially the fact that you have come to the Philippines as your first stop, is a very strong indication and sends a very strong message of the commitment of both our countries to continue to work together, to maintain the peace in the Indo-Pacific Region within the South China Sea,” the President said. Malacañang Press Officer Claire Castro meanwhile welcomed the US Defense chief’s reaffirmation of the US commitment to its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. “Opo, magandang-magandang balita po iyan para sa ating bansa. Katunayan nga po ay nagkaroon po ng reaffirmation ng US commitment to uphold our Mutual Defense Treaty,” Castro said. (Yes, that is good news for the country. Proof of that is the reaffirmation of US commitment to our Mutual Defense Treaty)",

Inquest proceedings are summary investigations conducted by a public prosecutor to determine whether there is probable cause to further detain a person arrested without a warrant and whether an information or formal case should be filed against them in court. NBI Director Jaime Santiago said Tuesday that rice at the warehouse had been mixed with different varieties of rice and then repacked to be sold at a higher price. ADVERTISEMENT Authorities arrested the warehouse manager, two cashiers and an inventory officer in the raid. The NBI said the four refused to name the owner of the warehouse. The NBI said they would file complaints of hoarding, adulteration, profiteering, untruthful labeling, and economic sabotage against the four.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Former Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Tuesday explained his statement during Monday's House hearing, where he said that former President Rodrigo Duterte authorized the transfer of P47.6 billion worth of COVID-19 funds to the Procurement Service of the Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM). According to Duque, his remark \"has regrettably been taken out of context.\" Duque insisted that the transfer of funds for the procurement of common-use supplies and equipment (CSEs) such as face masks, face shields, and PPEs was above-board given the urgency and novelty of the situation. \"What has been lost in the political noise is the fact that these CSEs were procured sometime in April 2020, during the very beginning of the pandemic... Their procurement was not only necessary, but was of extreme urgency,\" Duque said. ADVERTISEMENT The Ombudsman in May said that the medical supplies were not CSEs, a term that usually refers to office supplies. \"Indeed, the directive of President Duterte was consistent with and pursuant to the national policy embodied in the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act 1 and 2,\" he added. Duque also said that Duterte's authorization for the transfer was not new as it was well-documented in his public pronouncements. \"President Duterte has been consistent and open in directing his administration, as a whole, to act swiftly and decisively and do all that it can to fight the pandemic... His directives were openly made and repeated during our numerous cabinet meetings, his regular televised public address, and in various interviews reported by news outlets,\" Duque explained. The purchase of the COVID-19 supplies was allegedly marred by corruption, with Pharmally accused of being a preferred contractor. ADVERTISEMENT Former Senate President Franklin Drilon earlier said that Duque's statement during the hearing was a \"change of tune\". Sen. Risa Hontiveros said Duterte should explain why he ordered the transfer of funds. Government officials, including Duterte, had defended the transaction, saying there was a need to fast-track procurement because of the COVID-19 emergency and that the controversial firm had delivered on the contracts.",

    "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) -- The MRT Line 7 will be partly operational by the fourth quarter of 2025, a Department of Transportation (DOTr) official said Tuesday. Transportation Assistant Secretary for Railways Jorjette Aquino said the MRT-7's Quezon City portion, which consists of 12 stations, will be up and running towards the end of next year. Meanwhile, the Tala Station in Caloocan City will be completed by 2026. Aquino said they hope the construction of the 14th station in San Jose del Monte in Bulacan can be finished by 2027 once alignment issues are resolved. ADVERTISEMENT The city government of San Jose Del Monte earlier proposed 3 alternative route alignments for the project. In a statement, Mayor Arthur Robes said the current plan had current and future traffic implications, and would affect the quality of living, as well as disrupt the delivery of essential services, among others. Aquino said the DOTr, together with the private sector proponent San Miguel Corporation, will conduct a joint site inspection of these proposed realignments this June. \"After that inspection, inaasahan namin na ang San Miguel ang magkakaroon ng ridership study sa bawat option at bawat alignment para mai-presenta nila sa DOTr at makipagbigay sila ng recommendation nila kung ano sa tingin nila yung magiging mas beneficial sa mga pasahero,\" she said. (After that inspection, we expect San Miguel to come up with a ridership study for each option and each alignment that they can present to the DOTr along with a recommendation of what they see as the most beneficial (route) for passengers.) ADVERTISEMENT Aquino noted that one of their main considerations is accessibility. \"Siyempre tinitignan natin yung convenience ng pasahero. Malapit ba ito sa mga transport terminals? Para mas madaling mapuntahan,\" she said. (Of course, we’re looking at what will be convenient for passengers. Will it be near other transport terminals? So that it will be easily accessible.) Aquino added that should there be adjustments to the location of the station, it would not be too far off from the original plan. \"Hindi naman siguro totally maiiba, still within the area. Yung exact location lang e siguro magkakaroon ng displacement ng 100 meters,\" said Aquino. ADVERTISEMENT (It probably will not be totally changed, it will still be within the area. But as to the exact location, there may have to be a displacement of about 100 meters.) \"Kung makapag-decide tayo for the location of San Jose Del Monte, hopefully by 2027, makakapag-operate yung Station 14,\" she added. (If we can decide on the location in San Jose Del Monte, hopefully by 2027, we can start operations for Station 14.) The construction of the 22-kilometer rail is 69.86 percent done as of May 2024. Once completed, it is expected to reduce travel time from Quezon City to San Jose Del Monte to just 35 minutes.",

    "article_body": "MANILA – The reported deployment of China's bombers in Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) in the West Philippine Sea is \"expected\" amid the visit of US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to the Philippines, analysts said on Saturday. Based on a Reuters report on Friday, satellite images showed Beijing deployed two long-range H-6 bombers around Bajo de Masinloc – which came ahead of Hegseth's visit. Geopolitical analyst Don McLain Gill said this just showed \"China is not happy.\" \"It is frustrated with the fact that the Philippines is stepping up in ensuring that it has the capacity to defend its sovereignty and sovereign rights and working with countries who also share the same goals and objectives,\" said Gill in a chance interview with reporters. ADVERTISEMENT \"Definitely, being an expansionist power, China will not take this happily, therefore it is a show of frustration,\" he added. Prof. Renato de Castro, an international relations expert, said Beijing's reaction is expected and is only for optics. \"Very strong talaga yung nangyari, yung joint statement ng DND tsaka ng US department na mag-deploy ng missile,\" said De Castro in a Saturday news forum. \"The Chinese are expected to react, they have to cater to their population. Ipapakita nila na tine-threaten tayo so we have to do certain actions, like sending two bombers sa panatag shpoal and expect a live fire exercise. Kumbaga pinapakita ng Tsina na 'hindi kami papasindak sa inyo,'\" he added. The Philippines, he said, is entitled to strengthen its defense system. ADVERTISEMENT ABS-CBN News reached out to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to confirm the presence of China's bombers in the West Philippine Sea but its spokesperson has yet to respond. On Friday, the US and the Philippines agreed that one of the key initiatives to accelerate its longstanding defense partnership is the deployment of more advanced US military capabilities in the Philippines. This includes the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS)—a mobile, ground-based anti-ship missile launcher—and highly capable unmanned surface vessels. The training and testing of NMESIS will also be integrated into the upcoming Balikatan exercises, the annual joint military drills between Philippine and US forces. Hegseth told President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. on Friday, that the two countries must stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" in the face of the threat represented by China.",

Marcos last week held a Senate hearing on Duterte's arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands. She said she will present her preliminary findings soon but said the government's actions \"run counter to my ideals and principles.\" She added: \"Thus, I cannot stand on the same campaign platform as the rest of the Alyansa.\" ADVERTISEMENT Sen. Marcos had earlier on declined inclusion in the slate, saying she wanted to be able to talk to both factions in the former UniTeam alliance. President Marcos said his sister was welcome on the slate and that the administration would support her reelection campaign. He did not mention Sen. Marcos at a campaign sortie on March 21 when he batted for the members of the administration ticket. \"As I have stated from the outset of the election period, I will continue to maintain my independence,\" Sen. Marcos said Wednesday. In the same statement, she said government resource speakers' answers — and lack of them when they invoked executive privilege and the sub judice rule — \"only gave rise to ever greater suspicion that the Constitution may have been disregarded and our sovereignty diminished by the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.\" Alyansa campaign manager Navotas Rep. Toby Tiangco said, \"We respect Senator Imee’s decision.\" \"We wish her luck in the campaign,\" he added.",

These names are similar but also somewhat different to Mary Grace Piattos, since they only have a singular \"T\" in their middle name and surname. Another name that Ortega revealed was \"Xiaome Ocho\", seemingly named after a Xiaomi cellphone model in 2018. “Grabe naman ang ‘special treatment’ sa pamilya Piattos. May Mary Grace Piattos, may Pia Piatos-Lim, may Renan Piatos. Ano bang meron sa kanila at parang qualified silang lahat makatanggap ng confidential funds?” Ortega said in a press release. ADVERTISEMENT Similar to Mary Grace Piattos and \"Kokoy Villamin\", another suspicious name that appeared last December in Office of the Vice President (OVP)'s confidential fund receipts, these new names have no records of birth, marriage, or death from the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA). “Anong klase itong confidential funds disbursement na hindi natin matukoy kung totoong tao ba ang mga tumanggap?” Ortega asked. “Public funds ito, pero parang ginamit sa isang imaginary payroll,” he claimed. The Young Gun also vowed to \"expose more members\" of what he called \"Budol Gang\", pertaining to the unique name mentioned in Duterte's receipts. “The public deserves the truth. Hindi tayo dapat pumayag na ganito na lang, na parang walang nangyari sa napakalaking budol gamit ang confidential funds,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT The OVP has yet to issue a statement about the bared additional names, although Duterte reasoned out in December that explaining what some call \"fabricated\" receipts might \"compromise intelligence operations\". The name “Mary Grace Piattos” appeared in at least one of the acknowledgment receipts (AR) supposedly submitted by the OVP to the Commission on Audit (COA) explaining its controversial 2022 confidential expenses. Its peculiarity was questioned during one of the hearings of House Quad Committee last year. The receipts were related to the ₱125 million confidential funds that were allegedly spent in just 11 days, as revealed by Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo. With some doubting the actual identity of Mary Grace Piattos, there were already several lawmakers who offered reward money to anyone who could provide any lead about her.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Filipinos in the United Arab Emirates are expected to benefit from its recognition of degrees from the University of the Philippines Open University (UPOU), it said. The UPOU said its degrees “are now officially recognized for equivalency” by UAE’s Ministry of Education, which overseas Filipino workers could leverage for “career advancement and employment opportunities.” “This development will have a profound impact on the professional and economic mobility of our OFWs, enabling them to transition from high-risk, low-paying jobs to safer, more stable, and higher-income positions,” UP President Angelo Jimenez said. Prior to the accreditation, Filipinos with UPOU degrees reportedly faced challenges in career advancement since their graduate programs were not recognized by the UAE, the state university noted. ADVERTISEMENT UAE hosts some 650,000 OFWs, according to 2020 data from the Department of Foreign Affairs. UPOU Chancellor Joane Serrano vowed to expand the university’s Ventures for International and Transformative Academia program “that Filipinos around the world can avail of high-quality UP education.” MANILA -- The Manila Trial Court's recent ruling on the falsification of notary only pertains to Orly Guteza, according to the Department of Justice spokesperson Polo Martinez. This, after Martinez was asked if Sen. Rodante Marcoleta would be held liable over the falsification since he was the one who presented Guteza as a surprise witness to the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee. \"As far as the affidavit is concerned doon sa pagka-falsify niya, ayon sa Manila Trial Court, it only pertains to the accused, in that case na si Orly Guteza,\" Martinez said in DZMM TeleRadyo's Kabayan. \"Kung maiinvolve ba si Sen. Marcoleta, well I cannot speak on the senator's behalf pero basic understanding ng batas or kaso is that kung sino lang ang akusado, siya lang ang affected,\" he added. ADVERTISEMENT Martinez said the ethics committee may take action over Marcoleta's involvement with Guteza's falsification, but clarified that it is only a possibility and does not know if the body would actually conduct any disciplinary action or probe into the matter. \"I cannot speak on behalf of the Senate or of Sen. Marcoleta in this regard. We state facts here and ang fact lang is that the Manila court or a judge rendered the affidavit by Orly Guteza to be falsified,\" he said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Philippines awarded the “highest honors” to two Philippine Air Force (PAF) pilots on Saturday, as soon as their remains arrived at the Villamor Air Base days after the aerial mishap that led to their demise. PAF Major Jude Salang-oy and First Lieutenant April John Dadulla were accorded the Distinguished Aviation Cross after their FA-50 lead-in trainer fighter jet crashed into Mount Kalatungan earlier this week. “Ang morale ng PAF is in mourning right now. We are deeply saddened by this event but our mission goes on,” PAF spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo told reporters. “This will inspire us to do our mandate better. We hope the whole nation will join us in giving honor to the bravery and patriotism of our fallen comrades,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo led the military honors for the fallen pilots after the C130 plane carrying their remains arrived in Pasay City from Cagayan de Oro. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was supposed to lead the ceremonies, but canceled hours before the event “due to an urgent matter.” Aside from the posthumous award, the pilots’ families will also receive financial assistance for interment, as well as livelihood and education packages, Castillo said. A vigil will be held for the pilots in the PAF Headquarter in Pasay for a day, before another ceremony in the Basa Air Base in Pampanga. Salang-Oy was a member of the Philippine Military Academy's \"Siklab Diwa\" Class of 2014, while Dadulla is part of the PAF’s Officer Candidate Course 'Sinaglawin' Class of 2020. ADVERTISEMENT They were on a mission to provide air support to government troops in Bukidnon with other members of their flight when they went missing, the PAF earlier said. After the crash, the PAF’s FA-50 units are placed on “administrative grounding” while investigations continue, Castillo said. “Ang directive naman ng Pangulo, as well as yung chain of command, is for a thorough investigation to be conducted,” she said. “Iche-check ang current fleet para ma-rule out ang material factor… pero kung kailangan natin sila lumipad to respond to emergencies then we will bring them back to air,” she said. The Philippines acquired the 12 FA-50 units from South Korea from 2015 to 2017 for P18.9 billion. ADVERTISEMENT “Mayroon tayong recommendation to buy another 12 aircraft but it will depend on higher headquarters,” the PAF spokesperson said. The PAF has yet to say when their investigations are expected to be completed and if the findings will be released to the public.",

Police Maj. Gen. Nicolas Torre, director of the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group, was part of the team that implemented the ICC arrest warrant as requested by Interpol. \"Mismong si President Duterte ni-remind niya ako na magre-retire ako at aasuntuhin ako ng kaniyang mga anak, mga kamag-anak after my retirement, even before my retirement. thinreaten niya ko,\" Torre said in a Malacañang briefing. (Duterte himself reminded me that his children, his relatives will sue me after my retirement — even before my retirement) ADVERTISEMENT He added that Duterte's partner Honeylet Avanceña and daughter Veronica — also known as Kitty — verbally and physically assaulted him during the tense moment. \"Pisikal po ay itinulak ako ni Honeylet, tinabig niya ko, at malakas ang pagkatabig nya nung nagkasalubong kami sa hallway. [And] nasa video naman minura ako ng kaniyang anak,\" Torre said. (Honeylet pushed and shoved me, and it was a strong shove, when we met in the hallway. And you can see in videos that her daughter cursed at me) The police officer said he shrugged off the incident as part of the job. \"Everything is okay. Makapal ang ating balat at yan ay kayang-kaya nating palampasin yan (We have thick skin so we can easily let that pass),\" he said. While Torre decided to ignore his altercation with Avanceña, the PNP said it may file direct assault raps against her for a separate incident where she allegedly hit a cop with her cellphone.

Gen paid a courtesy call on Marcos Jr. after he visited several military bases in La Union, some of which were funded through aid and loans from Japan. “Turns out that it was a very busy day and I'm glad that you were able to see all of the new facilities that have been put up under the auspices of the Japanese government,” the Philippine President said. “I hope that with the many changes that occurred in our region… we will be able to discuss some of those anticipated changes that we are looking at in view of strengthening the relation between Japan and the Philippines,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “I’m sure we can find much common ground to build further.” Gen agreed with Marcos Jr., saying that there have been “many things agreed on” between Manila and Tokyo. “The Japan and the Philippines have been making great developments in the area of defense cooperation and security cooperation by the leadership and partnership between Your Excellency and Prime Minister Ishiba,” Gen said. Japan and the Philippines signed a 1.6 billion yen ($10.65 million) security assistance deal in December 2024 to boost the Southeast Asian nation's maritime security and surveillance abilities amid heightened tensions in the South China Sea. In July the two countries signed a landmark military pact allowing deployment of forces on each other's soil, smoothing military cooperation between the two countries.",

Tarlac is home to major military bases, including one used by the Philippines and the United States for live-fire exercises during annual military drills. In a statement, the Tarlac city government said the donations in question were made by the local Filipino-Chinese business community, “a longstanding partner in our civic and charitable initiatives, in cooperation with the Qiaoxing Volunteer Group - Philippines, which identifies itself as a Filipino-Chinese charitable association.” “These contributions were accepted in good faith by the recipients thereof with the sincere intention of enhancing public service and no conditions or obligations were attached to them,” it said. ADVERTISEMENT The city government denied receiving, managing or distributing a P500,000 cash donation, saying the Filipino-Chinese group only donated P200,000 to the city government for various programs. “The same has so far been unutilized after having been deposited in the City coffers on September 18, 2023. The said donation was accepted by virtue of SP Resolution No. IX-33-486,” it said. “Furthermore it must be emphasized that these donations, given their insignificant amount, in no way influenced our decision making process in governance nor led to any substantial collaboration thereafter.” It said another P100,000 was donated to the Department of Education-Tarlac City District, which was used to procure dental kits for 606 Kindergarten learners across 19 schools. A donation of 15 motorcycles were allocated as follows: 5 to the Philippine National Police (PNP) – Tarlac Province, 5 to the Philippine National Police – Tarlac City and 5 to the Public Order and Safety Office (POSO). ADVERTISEMENT Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro earlier said there was nothing wrong with accepting donations if they are done in good faith. “However, if these donations were given with ulterior motives, then we need to investigate,\" she said. China's foreign ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said China required its citizens to abide by local laws and that civic groups spontaneously set up by citizens were not affiliated with the Beijing government. The Philippines has arrested at least eight suspected Chinese spies in recent weeks, including the four, adding to frictions between the two nations who have had a series of run-ins over disputed parts of the South China Sea.

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Coordinating Council of Private Educational Association on Saturday said it supports the Department of Education's investigation into \"ghost\" students as it stressed that the Senior High School Voucher Program has been a big help to actual learners. COCOPEA lawyer Joseph Estrada told Teleradyo Serbisyo that the association wants the voucher program protected from potential fraud through \"more efficient targeting\" of beneficiaries. \"Ang dami pong natutulungan ng Senior High School Voucher Program ng government. This year alone, more than a million ang ating subsidy beneficiaries and mayroong 4000+ na private schools participating in the program,\" Estrada said. (The Senior High School Voucher Program has helped so many. This year alone, it has more than a million subsidiary beneficiaries, with more than 4,000 schools participating in the program) ADVERTISEMENT The DepEd has an Education Service Contracting agreement with private schools for them to take in learners to help decongest public schools. The voucher program is meant to help defray the costs of private school tuition. COCOPEA said it does not know which of the private schools are among the 12 being investigated for potential fraud but said its member schools \"have consistently remained uninvolved in fraud cases.\" On Monday, DepEd said it will probe several schools allegedly defrauding the voucher program. Education Secretary Sonny Angara said they will explore legal measures against those who will be found liable. Sen. Win Gatchalian in 2024 flagged the supposed existence of more than 19,000 supposed \"ghost\" students, based on the Commission on Audit (COA)'s 2016 and 2018 reports. COA defined \"ghost students\" are those “whose absence cannot be satisfactorily explained by the school officials”, are listed under one school but attend a different school or campus, or are “listed as enrolled but have not attended classes since the start of the semester.” ADVERTISEMENT COCOPEA, however, said there are cases where the \"double billing\" happens in private schools not because of fraud but due to system challenges. \"Halimbawa, 'yung isang estudyante nag-decide siya na mag-enroll sa private school tapos nagbago ang isip at lumipat sa isa na namang private school within the billing period, talagang magkakaproblema kung sino 'yung magbi-bill,\" Estrada explained. (For example, a student may decide to enroll at one private school and decide to switch schools during the billing period. That will really cause problems on who will be doing the billing.) He stressed COCOPEA worries that the misused funds from alleged ghost students of 12 schools could significantly affect the government and the program. He also noted that the group advocates for \"quality assurance of the private schools\" participating in the program, saying better screening would help prevent \"ghost\" students. ADVERTISEMENT In the past, schools with reported irregularities in implementing and utilizing subsidies would refund the given voucher, whether the billing issue was intentional or not, he said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista said on Thursday there would be no more extension for the consolidation of jeepneys under the public utility vehicle modernization program (PUVMP) after April 30. Malacanang announced late Wednesday that the consolidation deadline was extended until April 30. In a briefing, Bautista emphasized that this is the eight time the deadline for consolidation was extended by the government. “Hindi na kami magre-recommend ng any extension. This is the 8th time that we are extending the deadline,” Bautista said. ADVERTISEMENT Bautista said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., just heeded the clamor of transport groups to extend the consolidation period for public utility jeepneys (PUJs). “After yesterday’s special cabinet meeting, the president and I have a chance to discuss the program and the clamor for an extension. Our recommendation for an extension was based on the number of unconsolidated drivers and operators specially here in the National Capital Region. An extension will allow them to meet the consolidation requirement,” Bautista explained. “Maraming lumalapit sa amin… Ang sabi nila hindi nila masyadong naintindihan yung programa but then ay naintindihan na nila at willing na silang mag-consolidate so yun ang hinahabol namin, yung hindi willing mag-consolidate siguro yun ang hindi nagsusuporta sa programa natin,” Bautista added. He believes that the 3-month extension is enough time for unconsolidated jeepneys to comply with all the necessary requirements. Bautista explained that although the 76 percent consolidation of transportation stakeholders is more than enough to implement the program, the extension could help the agency to improve the implementation of the PUVMP. ADVERTISEMENT “Hopefully with this extension, siguro we can increase it, siguro with 85%. With 85%, I'm very sure this will be a very successful program,” Bautista said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said the president’s decision to have another extension is a welcome development. “We welcomed the news from the president and the secretary….those who misled by groups in joining and who failed to make it during the cut-off time will be given this second chance to redeem themselves and join the program,” Guadiz said. According to Guadiz, the LTFRB is still open to have another dialogue with PISTON and MANIBELA, the groups opposing the program. “I was in a meeting in congress with Ka Mody [Floranda] and Manibela’s Mar Valbuena. They have agreed to visit my office and come up with a dialogue, perhaps we can still come up with a compromise - we have a clear cut requirement but we still need to talk,” Guadiz told the media. ADVERTISEMENT Bautista said single jeepney operators who still wish to join the consolidation program will be allowed to form their own cooperatives or corporations. \"Since the president extended it for 3-months, now we will allow them to form their own cooperatives or corporation,” Bautista explained. LTFRB said the consolidation will be open again to all and those jeepney operators who wishes to consolidate their units may apply in their regional offices or in the central office.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday assured the public that health authorities are ready to respond to the ongoing monkeypox outbreak while noting that the Philippines has no history of monkeypox in humans. \"The Department of Health and its partners have been preparing for the monkeypox virus ever since an uptick in cases was reported in other countries in May 2022,\" the DOH said in a statement. The department made the announcement after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared monkeypox as a public health emergency of international concern, the highest alarm it sounds on emerging infectious diseases. With the declaration, the DOH said that the WHO has issued temporary recommendations to guide the response. ADVERTISEMENT These guidelines include activation of mechanisms for readiness and response, raising awareness on the monkeypox virus transmission, and intensifying detection capacity, epidemiology, and disease surveillance, among others. As cases of monkeypox were rising around the world last May, the DOH convened the Philippine Inter-agency Committee on Zoonosis (PhilCZ). Members of the PhilCZ include the DOH, Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and their respective agencies. Technical guidelines have also been drafted, approved, and circulated for the surveillance, screening, management, and infection control of monkeypox as early as May, the DOH said. \"DOH emphasizes across all its guidelines and advisories that any individual can get monkeypox,\" it added. ADVERTISEMENT \"Hanggang sa ngayon, wala pa rin pong nakitaan sa Pilipinas na pasok sa depenisyon ng isang suspect monkeypox case. Ang itsura ay karaniwang naipapaliwanag ng ibang mga sakit na kahawig ng monkeypox, ngunit hindi nito kapareho,\" DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said. (Up to now, there has been no finding in the Philippines that fits the definition of a suspect monkeypox case. The clinical presentation is often explained by other diseases that look like monkeypox, but is not the same.) “The DOH will keep the Filipino public updated with factual information,” she added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) — President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. on Monday said there is a \"strong argument\" to extend the term of outgoing Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil. Marbil is expected to retire on February 7, 2025 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 56. But according to Marcos, it would \"not be good\" to shake up the PNP leadership while the country is in the middle of an election period. \"There is a very strong argument that it would not be good for stability especially to change chief PNP in the middle of campaign period, and then approaching an election period,\" Marcos said in a chance interview. ADVERTISEMENT Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla last week said Marbil's term may be extended for another 4 months. Marcos on Monday mentioned a similar timeline. \"Pinag-aaralan namin but I think that is a very strong argument to keep him on at the very least until after the elections,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) said the plan to extend Marbil's term is subject to the President's \"absolute discretion.\" Asked if such an extension is not allowed during an election period, Comelec chairman George Garcia said: \"It's an absolute discretion of the President subject to his sound wisdom.\" ADVERTISEMENT \"May continuing authority po si President,\" he added. Comelec spokesperson Atty. John Rex Laudiangco explained that such extension is not considered a transfer, which is prohibited and would need prior approval from the Comelec \"Lumalabas po kasi yung extension po ay hindi naman 'transfer or detail whatever of any officer or employee in the civil service' na prohibition na required ang prior approval of COMELEC po to validly effect po,\" Laudiangco said in a text message. The Philippines' midterm elections is scheduled on May 12. -- with a report from Willard Cheng, ABS-CBN News",

    "article_body": "Former president Rodrigo Duterte branded a liar by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Duterte had echoed allegations that the president signed a 2025 budget law that is susceptible to abuse. -ANC, The World Tonight, January 20, 2025 GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday joined other world leaders in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit, where host country South Korea called for “harmony and coexistence” despite differences in national interests. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in his opening remarks urged APEC members to “become connected and be more open” to one another so that the region — which registered 48 percent of global trade — “can go down the path of prosperity.” “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” said Lee, whose country is hosting the annual regional meeting this year. “Free trade is facing wild changes. Uncertainties are growing for the global economy and trade and investment is losing its vitality,” he said during the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting Informal Dialogue with Guests. ADVERTISEMENT “Cooperation and solidarity is the only answer that will lead all of us to a better tomorrow. We cannot always be on the same page as each member economy may have their own interests, yet we cannot always unite with the ultimate goal of gathering strength for co-prosperity.” Lee’s opening statement comes as Manila and Beijing’s relations continue to be marred by China’s incursions in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that invalidated its sweeping 9-dash line claim in the South China Sea. This year’s APEC also marks the first time that Marcos Jr. and Xi would meet in person since January 2023, when the Filipino leader traveled to Beijing for a state visit in an attempt to amicably settle disputes in the strategic waterway where trillions-worth of goods pass through annually. The Summit is being held in Gyeongju — South Korea’s ancient capital — where consensus building has been honored for centuries, Lee said. “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” Lee said, noting that “free trade is facing wild changes” while “uncertainties are growing for the global economy, and trade and investment is losing its vitality.” ADVERTISEMENT “[But] The Hwabaek spirit does not enforce any single idea but rather strive to achieve a harmony of different voices, exploring the path for harmony and coexistence,” he said. “The more we become connected and the more open we become to one another, the further we can go down the path of prosperity.” The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said that Marcos Jr. is not expected to have a bilateral meeting with Xi on the sidelines of the APEC 2025, saying that this forum traditionally focuses on economic and trade issues, instead of security and defense. On October 30, Marcos Jr. told Filipinos here that he would focus on wooing investors from APEC economies to help boost the Philippines’ tech industry as the world further shifts to digitalization and artificial intelligence. Marcos Jr. has described the APEC as a “very important” meeting, underscoring that the regional bloc represents over 80 percent of the Philippines’ trade.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — A lawmaker on Wednesday called on government to give second COVID-19 booster doses to the general population. According to Iloilo First District Rep. and former health secretary Janette Garin, Filipinos need additional protection as various omicron subvariants emerge. At present, the second booster shot is only available for health workers, senior citizens and immunocompromised individuals. \"If I want added protection, why will I be prevented if it will not create any harm? And we have enough supplies,\" she told ANC. ADVERTISEMENT \"There are expiring vaccines, there are people who want a second shot, a second booster, and actual real-world data shown advantages of having 2 boosters especially among those with comorbidities and among those 50 years old and above,\" added the lawmaker. As of June 1, the Philippines has received a total of 245 million vaccine doses, according to the National Task Force Against COVID-19. Of those, over 194 million doses have been distributed as of May 29, said the ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group, which monitors government data. Nearly 70.7 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. Of the figure, only 15 million have received additional jab. Instead of donating the expiring COVID-19 vaccines to other countries, the government should use them on the general population, a public health advocate said. ADVERTISEMENT According to Dr. Minguita Padilla, economic frontliners should also be allowed to get their second COVID-19 booster shots. The Health Technology Assessment Council has yet to decide whether to allow another booster shot for the general public. \"One of the problems we see with HTAC is they're looking for very, very solid evidence,\" Padilla said. \"But you have a pandemic like this and even the CDC in the US, they're going by the real-world data, meaning as it's happening.\" \"Sometimes overcaution can be detrimental to the public welfare,\" she added. The Philippines is currently experiencing a spike in new coronavirus infections amid the presence of more transmissible variants and the population's waning immunity.",

Several South Korean POGO workers were found hiding in the basement of the Heritage Hotel in Pasay City earlier this month, while several foreign workers were rescued from a hotel in Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu last year. “We are taking a look at the criminal liability of local government unit officials, primarily those involved in the issuances of permits,” PAOCC spokesperson Winston Casio said in a Malacañang press conference. “Usually kapabayaan ito… Ang LGU ay isa sa may pinakamalaking visitorial at regulatory powers kaya hindi sapat na sabihin ng alkalde na hindi niya alam na ilegal yung kaniyang mga nasasakupan,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Most of the raided POGOs in Metro Manila were located in the southern part of the capital region, namely in Makati, Pasay and Parañaque, the PAOCC official said. “The southern parts of Metro Manila have been identified as the location of these POGOs… [but] we do not want to politicize the matter because this is not a political matter,” he said. “This is a law enforcement problem,” he said. Casio refused to divulge details of the ongoing case investigation, but said that they are also investigating hotel workers, where POGO workers were found. The PAOCC earlier filed criminal and civil cases against former Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo and other officials linked to operations of the mega POGO compound in the sleepy agricultural town. ADVERTISEMENT Porac Mayor Jing Capil and 10 other officials from Pampanga are also facing graft charges for their supposed ties to illegal gambling operations. As of February 14, 12 cases have been filed against POGO personalities, while 8 other cases are undergoing preliminary investigation, based on data from the PAOCC. The agency said it is preparing 13 other cases linked to illegal gambling operations in the Philippines.",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board aims to come out with a resolution by April regarding the petition to increase jeepney fares, said LTFRB Chairperson Teofilo Guadiz on Wednesday. Transport groups led by the Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines (ALTODAP) sought a P2 provisional fare increase amid rising fuel prices. If granted, the fare for traditional jeepneys would go up from P13 to P15, while modern jeepney fares would increase from the current P15 to P17. ALTODAP President Boy Vargas said modern jeepney operators in particular are struggling since they are also still paying amortization. ADVERTISEMENT “Buwan-buwan nagbabayad kami dyan kasi modern (unit) yan e. May loan po kasi kami… Medyo mataas din ang konsumo (sa diesel) ng mga modern e dahil kasi may dinadala pong aircon yan,” he said. But during a hearing at the LTFRB office in Quezon City, Vargas noted that their new petition would only be temporary. “Pagbaba ng diesel, pwede naming ibaba rin yung pamasahe automatically, kasi ayaw din naming pahirapan yung mga mananakay,” he explained. Still, Guadiz said the LTFRB board would have to review the petition, especially considering that jeepney operators are already able to receive fuel subsidies whenever the benchmark Dubai crude price hits $80 per barrel. “May P10,000 po yan na fuel subsidy na binibigay namin which should act as a buffer doon sa pagtaas ng gasolina,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Kung mapruwebahan naman nila na kahit may P10,000 na fuel subsidy ay hindi pa rin po sapat yung kanila pong kinikita, then we will probably grant some of the request,” added Guadiz. The Department of Transportation earlier said that the latest tranche of fuel subsidy payouts will begin in March. Vargas however said that this is not enough. “Panandalian lang yun e. Sandali lang, ubos na rin agad,” he said. Some jeepney drivers have also complained about the disbursement process, saying it’s too slow or worse — sometimes it does not reach them at all. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, a separate group of jeepney groups have withdrawn their petition for a fare hike in consideration of commuters. “Kung anuman yung kakulangan, nakapagtitiis pa po yung aming mga miyembro,” said Deo Sotto, the National President of the Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines. Instead, they want the government to focus on bringing down diesel prices by amending the Oil Deregulation Law. “Tsaka bawasan na lang yung excise tax dahil napakataas po ng buwis natin sa fuel,” said Liga ng Transportasyon at Operators ng Pilipinas President Orlando Marquez. Guadiz said this will also be weighed when the LTFRB board makes its decision. ADVERTISEMENT “Magtataka po kayo bakit ang isang napakalaking grupo, magsasabing sapat na (ang pasahe). Pero yung ibang grupo sinasabihing hindi,” he said. The LTFRB will also need to consult first the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on the possible inflationary effects of a fare hike.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of National Defense (DND) on Wednesday said that the government has plans in place should the tension between Taiwan and China escalate. DND officer-in-charge Jose Faustino Jr. said that the government has detailed plans and timelines should Filipinos in Taiwan need to be repatriated. Faustino said the government continues to \"closely monitor\" developments related to Taiwan and China. \"Right now, what we can do is closely monitor. We have prepared contingency if and ever worst case scenario will happen,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT He noted that other nations aside from the Philippines will be affected if the tensions rise, especially that the Taiwan Strait is considered a \"sea lane of communication.\" Faustino said the government is also preparing plans to address the possible surge of refugees, as the Philippines is Taiwan's nearest neighbor. Faustino said they are hoping the tensions between Taiwan and China will not escalate into war. But in the worst case scenario, he said the government will turn to its Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. \"We have to honor the Mutual Defense Treaty. Nakasulat po iyan sa Mutual Defense Treaty ng 1951 sa US. But nakasaad din doon, it will still be according to our constitutional processes at hindi po ito automatic. And the same sa US,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT Two geopolitical analysts said the Philippines will have a difficult time staying neutral amid the tensions, given the country's close ties with the US. Aside from the MDT, the Philippines also has a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the US. Since the treaty requires both countries to help each other in case of an external aggression, the Philippines would be on the side of the US, according to Professor Bobby Tuazon, Director for Policy Studies at the Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG). However, the Philippines’ stance should not depend on its defense deals with the US, but on its national interests, he said in a media forum in Quezon City. Meanwhile, Professor Anna Rosario Malindog Uy, Vice President for External Affairs of the Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute (ACPSSI), said the best thing the Philippines can do would be to not get involved in the tensions in the Taiwan Strait. ADVERTISEMENT Rather, the country must pursue a ‘genuine’ independent foreign policy and adhere to the One-China policy. “Let us be neutral,” Malindog Uy said in the same forum. “We should not be dragged into any conflict that is not our own making and we have nothing to do with.” She added, the current administration must reconsider and review its defense deals with the US. There are around 145,000 Filipinos working and residing in Taiwan. The recent visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan was seen by China as a violation of its sovereignty because it considers the self-ruled island part of its territory. ADVERTISEMENT Pelosi’s Taiwan visit angered China, which launched intensified live-fire military drills that raised fears of an armed conflict. The Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs had called for restraint by all parties concerned.",

Umarangkada na rin ang pagpapatupad ng maximum suggested retail price sa imported na bigas ngayong Lunes. Nagpapatrol, Jervis Manahan. TV Patrol, Lunes, 20 Enero 2025. GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday joined other world leaders in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit, where host country South Korea called for “harmony and coexistence” despite differences in national interests. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in his opening remarks urged APEC members to “become connected and be more open” to one another so that the region — which registered 48 percent of global trade — “can go down the path of prosperity.” “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” said Lee, whose country is hosting the annual regional meeting this year. “Free trade is facing wild changes. Uncertainties are growing for the global economy and trade and investment is losing its vitality,” he said during the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting Informal Dialogue with Guests. ADVERTISEMENT “Cooperation and solidarity is the only answer that will lead all of us to a better tomorrow. We cannot always be on the same page as each member economy may have their own interests, yet we cannot always unite with the ultimate goal of gathering strength for co-prosperity.” Lee’s opening statement comes as Manila and Beijing’s relations continue to be marred by China’s incursions in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that invalidated its sweeping 9-dash line claim in the South China Sea. This year’s APEC also marks the first time that Marcos Jr. and Xi would meet in person since January 2023, when the Filipino leader traveled to Beijing for a state visit in an attempt to amicably settle disputes in the strategic waterway where trillions-worth of goods pass through annually. The Summit is being held in Gyeongju — South Korea’s ancient capital — where consensus building has been honored for centuries, Lee said. “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” Lee said, noting that “free trade is facing wild changes” while “uncertainties are growing for the global economy, and trade and investment is losing its vitality.” ADVERTISEMENT “[But] The Hwabaek spirit does not enforce any single idea but rather strive to achieve a harmony of different voices, exploring the path for harmony and coexistence,” he said. “The more we become connected and the more open we become to one another, the further we can go down the path of prosperity.” The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said that Marcos Jr. is not expected to have a bilateral meeting with Xi on the sidelines of the APEC 2025, saying that this forum traditionally focuses on economic and trade issues, instead of security and defense. On October 30, Marcos Jr. told Filipinos here that he would focus on wooing investors from APEC economies to help boost the Philippines’ tech industry as the world further shifts to digitalization and artificial intelligence. Marcos Jr. has described the APEC as a “very important” meeting, underscoring that the regional bloc represents over 80 percent of the Philippines’ trade.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Department of National Defense (DND) chief Gilberto Teodoro, Jr. on Tuesday urged Filipinos to \"not lose sight\" of China's illegal activities in the West Philippine Sea as more details of an alleged \"gentleman's agreement\" unravel. \"While we realize that accountability is important in the issue on whether or not a so-called 'gentleman's agreement' was forged with China regarding the BRP Sierra Madre and Ayungin Shoal, we Filipinos must not lose sight of the fact that the main threat to our rights in the WPS is the Chinese Government's illegal activities,\" Teodoro said in a statement. Former Palace spokesman Harry Roque earlier claimed that then-President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck what he called a \"gentleman's agreement\" to maintain the status quo in Ayungin Shoal, where Manila's military outpost, the rusting BRP Sierra Madre, in the West Philippine Sea is located. China has repeatedly cited the alleged deal to put the blame on the Philippines over the worsening tension in the West Philippine Sea. ADVERTISEMENT But Teodoro said Beijing was using the \"deal\" to refocus the debate away from their illegal activities in the disputed waterway. He said Filipino must not fall into China's \"trap.\" \"Let us not fall into the trap set by Chinese propaganda of refocusing the debate on a so-called promise while deflecting attention away from China's government, thereby freeing and allowing them to continue with their illegal activities in our EEZ,\" Teodoro said. READ: 'Pinamigay na niya': Duterte-Xi secret deal meant giving away Ayungin Shoal - Carpio The 100-meter BRP Sierra Madre began its life as the USS LST-821, a tank landing ship of the US Navy during World War II. The ship was later renamed the USS Harnett County and used as a floating base in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. A gentleman's agreement between the Philippines and US allowed the transfer of the ship to the Philippine Navy after it was used to transport thousands of Vietnamese refugees to the Philippines. It was later renamed the BRP Sierra Madre. ADVERTISEMENT After decades of service, the BRP Sierra Madre was deliberately run aground in Ayungin Shoal in 1999 in an effort to check Beijing's advance in the contested waters. Meanwhile, Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Año and his US counterpart Jake Sullivan reaffirmed the alliance between the two countries following the recent incidents of harassment by China in the West Philippine Sea. The National Security Council on Tuesday said Año spoke on the phone with Sullivan the day prior, with the American official assuring and reaffirming the US’ “ironclad” commitment to the Philippines under the two countries’ Mutual Defense Treaty. “They discussed the recent spate of illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions by agents of the China Coast Guard and the Chinese Maritime Militia in the country’s EEZ,” the NSC said in a statement. “Secretary Año expressed his appreciation for the United States’ continued assurances and reaffirmation of its ironclad commitment to the PH-US Alliance,” it added. ADVERTISEMENT The NSC said the two national security advisers looked forward to the upcoming inaugural Japan-Philippines-US trilateral leaders’ summit in Washington D.C. next week.",

All of the new cases occurred in homes or on the streets. Most involved the use of illegal fireworks, the agency said. ADVERTISEMENT The new cases included 2 amputations due to illegal pla-pla lit by male teenagers who lost their fingers, the DOH added. The health department has recorded a total of 6 amputations due to fireworks this holiday season. \"Ang paputok ay hindi laruan. Maganda silang tingnan, ngunit nakamamatay na hawakan,\" the DOH reminded the public. \"Dapat magregalo ng kumpletong mga kamay at daliri sa kanilang mga anak ang bawat magulang. Ang mga ama at kuya ay dapat maging halimbawa para sa mga kabataang lalaki sa kanilang pamilya,\" it added. Filipinos typically usher in the New Year with noisemakers and fireworks supposedly to ward off bad luck and scare away evil spirits. New Year festivities are expected to ramp up as merry-goers seek to make up for lost time due to restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last three to four years. The interior department has urged local authorities to promote community fireworks displays and refrain from lighting up fireworks at home.",

The Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology has raised the alert level in Mt Kanlaon from Alert Level 1 (abnormal) to Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) following the eruption. This means “current unrest driven by shallow magmatic processes that could eventually lead to further explosive eruptions or even precede hazardous magmatic eruption.” At least 170 families or 796 individuals have been affected by the eruption, and have been brought to evacuation centers, the President said. ADVERTISEMENT “Patuloy ang ating mga ahensya tulad ng Philvocs, NDRRMC, at ang DSWD sa kanilang masusing pagsusubaybay at pag suporta. Namigay na tayo ng mga sleeping kits sa La Castillana, at may 13, 000 family food packs na ang naka pre-positioned sa Negros island at may karagdagang 40,000 food packs at iba pang non-food items na paparating,” he continued. Air assets are also on standby to ensure the government’s quick response, Marcos said. The Philippine leader also appealed to residents living near the volcano not to go near the 4 kilometer permanent danger zone. “Ako rin ay nananawagan sa lahat na maging mapag matyag at iwasan ang 4-km radius permanent danger zone. Mangyaring sumunod sa mga payo at tagubilin mula sa mga lokal na awtoridad,” he said.",

And when I say work together, it is not only for defense and security, it is also for disaster preparedness, disaster assistance that they might bring should there be a disaster such as Yolanda or Odette, once again, in the Philippines,” the President said. “So, there are many benefits for us and I think that it is something that we should continue and should encourage.” Marcos, however, said that the timing of these exercises will largely depend on the security situation in the West Philippine Sea. ADVERTISEMENT “Well, the scheduling of this is really a risk, really depend upon the situation in the West Philippine Sea, whether or not the threat levels and the tension levels are increasing or decreasing,” Marcos Jr said. The Philippine leader said the possible conduct of annual joint military drills with Australia is something that they can discuss with his Australian counterparts. “And as to having yearly exercises, well, that's probably something that we can discuss. But again, we will have to assess the situation at the time and if we need to continue these exercises, then I think we will be able to agree on that.”",

    "article_body": "Watch more News on iWantTFC.com. Watch hundreds of Pinoy shows, movies, live sports and news. MANILA — The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants a stricter limit on interest rates imposed by financing and lending companies. Under its draft memorandum circular, the SEC wants the maximum nominal interest rate fixed at 6 percent per month, or about 0.2 percent per day. The effective interest rate will be capped at 10 percent per month, or about 0.33 percent per day, including the nominal interest rate and all other applicable fees, like processing fees, service fees, notarial fees, handling fees, and verification fees. But this excludes penalties for late and non-payment of outstanding scheduled amounts due. ADVERTISEMENT Lending and financing companies may only charge penalties of up to 5 percent per month for late payment or non-payment on outstanding amounts due. Lending companies that break this rule will be fined P25,000 for the first offense, and P50,000 for the second offense. Financing companies, meanwhile, will be fined P50,000 for the first offense and P100,000 for the second offense. On the third offense, the SEC may impose a fine equivalent to at least twice the penalty for the second offense, but not more than P1 million. The company’s financing and lending activities may also be suspended for 60 days, and its secondary license may be revoked. ADVERTISEMENT If the offense is grave, the SEC may also suspend or revoke the company’s primary registration. The securities regulator is seeking public comments on the draft circular until November 14. SEC said it is doing this to strike a balance between consumer protection and the competitiveness of duly licensed lending and financing companies. “The number of borrowers struggling under excessive interest rates has continued to grow in recent years, as certain entities exploit the accessibility of online lending applications to trap our fellow kababayans in cycles of debt,” chairperson Francis Lim said. The SEC has been cracking down on online lending apps. ADVERTISEMENT In May, it revoked the corporate registration and financing license of Digido after it opened and operated four branches without obtaining a certificate of authority. In the same month, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of MagicPeso over abusive collection practices. It also filed criminal complaints against the operator of online lending app Easypeso for abusive collection practices. Earlier in October, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of online lending platforms Credit Cash and Credit Peso over unfair debt collection practices. The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission has monitored some 300 online lending apps, many of which are bogus. Some bogus lenders even go so far as to issue rape or death threats to borrowers so they would pay up. Authorities, however, are facing a blank wall in going after abusive lending apps since the companies simply discard these preregistered SIM cards after promoting their services or threatening their borrowers.",

So, wala pa po tayo; under evaluation pa po lahat,\" Castro said in a Palace briefing.

Like po Secretary Cesar Chavez, voluntary po iyong resignation niya so wala po tayong magagawa kung hindi talaga maghanap ng kaniyang kapalit,\" she said. \"So, ganoon lang po iyong nangyayari pero sabi nga po natin, as of now, kung ini-evaluate pa ang kung sino ang papalitan or kung may papalitan wala pa po tayong nadidinig, nag-e-evaluate pa lang po. It’s just normal for the President.\" Castro also confirmed that there will be changes in the leadership of the Presidential Communications Office, following the assumption of veteran broadcast journalist Jay Ruiz as PCO ad interim Secretary. Ruiz however, has not yet required PCO officials to submit their courtesy resignations, she said. \"As of now, wala pa po tayong natanggap but nagkaroon na po ng meeting at sinabi niya po talaga na magkakaroon ng pagbabago at maaaring may ma-retain, maaaring may mawala.

    "article_body": "MANILA — Parts of the Philippines may experience rainy weather on Christmas Eve, the state weather bureau said. The northeast monsoon or amihan will bring cloudy skies with rains in Cagayan Valley, Apayao, Kalinga, Ifugao, Mountain Province, Aurora, and Quezon, PAGASA said. Localized Thunderstorms, meanwhile, may hit Bicol Region, Palawan, Visayas, and Mindanao. PAGASA cautioned residents in these areas to watch out for possible flash floods or landslides. ADVERTISEMENT It added that Metro Manila and the rest of Luzon could experience partly cloudy to cloudy skies with isolated light rains due to the amihan.

GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Friday invited South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to visit the Philippines, and sought South Korea’s help to “promote a rules-based order, a more secure and more prosperous region.” “Next year, the Philippines will chair the ASEAN summits, and I see a real opportunity for us to promote a rules-based order, a more secure and more prosperous region,” Marcos told Lee during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit here. “I will express once again our deep gratitude for the deep ties that bind our two peoples from, as you have mentioned, fighting side-by-side during the war, to providing assistance in times of calamities, protecting the rights and welfare of our nationals,” he said. “I'm happy to note the steady progress of our strategic partnership. We have already reached several milestones, one of which was the bilateral free trade agreement and also our cooperation in areas of defense and security, amongst other key areas of mutual interest,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Before I go any further, allow me to invite you to come and visit us in the Philippines,” he added. Lee responded affirmatively and told Marcos: “I fully agree and I will try to visit the Philippines sometime soon.” The South Korean President also acknowledged the Philippines’ role in the Korean War, where some 7,420 Filipino soldiers were deployed as part of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces who fought alongside South Korean soldiers. “The Republic of Korea and the Philippines are very special friends. When we were in a national crisis, the Philippines sent its military to aid us so the people of Korea will never forget the contributions and dedication and sacrifices made by the Philippines,” Lee said. “Our two countries have maintained a very close relationship of cooperation and support, and we have mutually helped each other out over the years, but I hope that through your visit, we will be able to take that to another level and have much closer cooperation,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The Philippines — South Korea’s oldest diplomatic partner from the Southeast Asian region — is a key destination for South Koreans who are learning to speak in English, while the East Asian peninsula is a popular choice for Filipino tourists. As of 2024, South Korea ranked as the Philippines’ 5th largest export market with exports amounting to $3.53 billion, according to data from the Malacañang. In terms of imports, South Korea is the Philippines’ 4th largest supplier, with imports pegged at 9.6 billion. South Korea is also the Philippines' fourth-largest source of official development assistance (ODA), with aid packages reaching some $175.56 million as of June 2025.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Philippines may get access to monkeypox vaccines by 2023, the Department of Health said Wednesday, amid rising demand for the jab. DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said the agency is coordinating with the private sector in procuring vaccines for the disease. \"Unfortunately, doon po sa mga pag-uusap, ang pinakamaagang deliveries kung sakaling makakabili tayo would still be 2023,\" she told ANC's \"Headstart\". The DOH is exploring other avenues to acquire at least a minimal amount of monkeypox vaccines, which will be first given to healthcare workers, she added. ADVERTISEMENT Three manufacturers of monkeypox vaccines have so far been identified by the agency. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plan to purchase the jabs as a whole is still at initial stages, Vergeire said. \"With this Asean, it is still on the stage of exploratory meetings and then the whole Asean membership, these 10 countries, will be procuring as one so that we can have stocks for all of these countries. But at the initial stage pa lang po iyon,\" she added. More than 16,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in 75 countries so far this year, according to the World Health Organization. The Philippines confirmed its first case on July 29. Vergeire said the patient had since recovered from the disease, discharged from isolation and allowed to interact with other people. ADVERTISEMENT Monkeypox has long been endemic in Central and Western Africa but there have been outbreaks across the world since May. Majority of the cases globally, Vergeire said, were spread via close contact through sexual activity. Other routes include direct contact or by touching objects or fabrics used by someone who is infected. \"Just to clarify, gusto ho natin sabihin sa ating mga kababayan, kahit sino po maaaring magkaroon ng monkeypox,\" Vergeire said. \"Hindi lang po isang sector ng lipunan ang puwedeng magkaroon nito dahil iba-iba po ang kaniyang pagsalin o pagkakahawa sa ibang tao.\"",

    "article_body": "The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission on Thursday noted the need for stronger policies to go against illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators, adding that as many as 100 illegal POGOs are still operating in the country. Dr. Winston John Casio said this a day after PAOCC, the police and other Philippine agencies raided a massive illegal POGO hub operating in Porac, Pampanga for alleged sexual and labor trafficking. “To be honest with you, hindi namin alam kung hanggang kailan pa ito kayang i-sustain kung PAOCC lamang ang magsasagawa nito, kaya nga kami ay laging humihiling ng tulong. Kasi sa listahang ibinigay ni PAGCOR noong nakaraang taon, mayroon silang 402 na diumano’y mga kanseladong mga POGOs. Sa aming pagmamanman doon sa 402 na iyon marami pa ho, halos 100 pa rin ho ang mga operational sa mga iyon,” Casio said in a televised briefing. Casio says the PAOCC has so far raided only 4 of these illegal POGO hubs, with the tedious process of case buildup to the conduct of operations already taking them two months. ADVERTISEMENT “At the rate we are going ay hindi ho yata natin kayang tapusin ang problemang ito hangga’t hindi magkakaroon ng polisiya na magkaroon nang mas malalim at mas malakas na polisiya laban po dito sa mga scam farms na mga ito,” Casio said. The PAOCC spokesman however said that it will be up to PAOCC’s chairman, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, whether or not to recommend to President Marcos Jr. the total ban of POGOs. “But I am certain, we are certain because he has told this several times already to us, we, in the Secretariat na lubhang nakakabahala at dapat ituloy namin iyong aming malawakang operasyon laban sa mga scam farms na mga ito at huwag kaming panghihinaan ng loob sapagkat lagi po siyang nasa likod namin bilang aming chairman at tutulungan niya kami lagi para tuluyang maipasara at matigil ang problemang ito,” Casio said. Some 157 foreign nationals and 29 Filipinos were rescued on Wednesday by the PAOCC and other Philippine agencies from the Pampanga POGO linked to human trafficking. This was the second high-profile POGO operation in Central Luzon this year, following the earlier raid of the illegal POGO facility in Bamban, Tarlac.",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- President Ferdinand Marcos Jr has directed government agencies to ensure the safety and convenience of Filipino travelers during the Holy Week break, Malacanang said Tuesday. Palace Press Officer Claire Castro noted that measures are in place to strictly monitor the expected exodus of the public to the provinces for the traditional annual break and to prevent delays or accidents during their travels. \"Okay, mayroon po, naglabas na rin po ang DOTr [Department of Transportation]. At may direktiba po sa DOTr na dapat pong paigtingin ang kanilang pagmo-monitor sa nalalapit na pag-uwi ng mga kababayan natin sa kani-kanilang mga probinsiya. At sabi nga po, nagbigay po ng order ang ating Pangulo hindi lamang po sa DOTr pero sa mga attached agency po to ensure the safety and convenience of all the passengers who will be travelling to their hometowns or will have vacations,\" Castro said. \"Magkakaroon din po ng strict inspection sa mga terminals, ports, airports so that there will be no delays to the operations prior to the Holy Week kasi po mas marami pong maaaring magkaroon ng delays kapag maraming nagbibiyahe. So, iyan po ay pinamo-monitor ng ating Pangulo sa ating mga concerned agencies.\" ADVERTISEMENT Castro said that the President has also instructed police authorities to continue their law enforcement activities even during the Holy Week break \"Alam naman po natin na may mga pagkakataon na nagkakaroon pa rin, hindi maiiwasan na mayroong mangyayaring mga aksyon, mga krimen at hindi dapat matulog, iyan po ang direktiba ng Pangulo, hindi dapat matulog kahit Holy Week, kahit bakasyon ang karamihan; hindi dapat nagbabakasyon ang gobyerno. Patuloy pa rin po ang pagsasagawa ng mga monitoring at pagtulong sa ating kapuwa Pilipino,\" she said. The Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) have already started strengthening their safety measures and preparations for the expected influx of passengers. MARINA started its inspection of ports two weeks before the Holy Week peak season, while the PCG is set to deploy additional personnel in more vulnerable parts of Batangas Port. MARINA expects the peak season to start on April 16 or Holy Wednesday, ending on April 20 or Easter Sunday. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, the Paranaque Integrated Terminal Exchange is expecting around 2.5-million passengers to pass from April 9 to 23. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority will deploy more than 2,500 personnel during the Holy Week to ensure the safety and convenience of the public in various transportation hubs. MMDA Chairman Romando Artes said the agency will implement a \"no day off and no absence\" policy on April 16, 17, and 21, when heavy traffic is expected due to the Holy Week exodus.",

    "article_body": "MANILA - A group of educators is urging government to allow some schools to continue blended learning and to train teachers better in enforcing the K-to-12 program. Based on a recent Pulse Asia survey commissioned by Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, 44 percent of Filipinos are dissatisfied with the K-to-12 system. This is higher than the 28 percent dissatisfaction rate in a 2019 survey. The Department of Education has been \"delivering a behaviorist mode of teaching,\" or a traditional type, according to Prof. Lizamarie Campoamor-Olegario, research head of the Sequre Education Movement. \"The traditional type of teaching still tended to focus on knowing, memorizing,\" she told ANC's Headstart. ADVERTISEMENT Olegario said she did a study in 2017 where she interviewed K-to-12 teachers who gave good answers on the program's principles but performed poorly when observed. The teachers said they were only trained for a week through seminars and webinars, according to Olegario. \"I think webinars, seminars are not enough because it’s also traditional type. When I interviewed them they were able to answer the questions well,\" she said. \"I suggested in 2017 the teachers should be mentored, observed by experts.\" Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said he agrees that training teachers should be more extensive. ADVERTISEMENT \"Training teachers should be on a module basis, in other terms there should be a year-long program but the modules would be given in tranches,\" he said. \"Based on the assessment being done right now, it's something we expect to hear from the evaluators of the K-to-12 program.\" The DepEd reviewed the implementation of the Kinder to Grade 10 program prior to the assumption of the new administration, Densing said. Vice President Sara Duterte has since ordered the review of Grades 11 to 12, he added. \"Hopefully we’ll have the immediate results as soon as possible,\" he said. Some schools, meantime, should be allowed to continue blended learning as they do not have the capacity to implement full face-to-face classes, Olegario said. Some students can \"thrive\" in remote learning, she added. ADVERTISEMENT \"Schools should divide the total population so they can have smaller class sizes and meet them, alternately meet the students in groups so they can focus more on fewer students also,\" she said. \"We have a learning loss. This will better address the reading problem and other competency problems we have.\"",

A Chinese Navy warship was involved for the first time. - ANC, The World Tonight, December 4, 2024 GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday joined other world leaders in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit, where host country South Korea called for “harmony and coexistence” despite differences in national interests. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in his opening remarks urged APEC members to “become connected and be more open” to one another so that the region — which registered 48 percent of global trade — “can go down the path of prosperity.” “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” said Lee, whose country is hosting the annual regional meeting this year. “Free trade is facing wild changes. Uncertainties are growing for the global economy and trade and investment is losing its vitality,” he said during the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting Informal Dialogue with Guests. ADVERTISEMENT “Cooperation and solidarity is the only answer that will lead all of us to a better tomorrow. We cannot always be on the same page as each member economy may have their own interests, yet we cannot always unite with the ultimate goal of gathering strength for co-prosperity.” Lee’s opening statement comes as Manila and Beijing’s relations continue to be marred by China’s incursions in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that invalidated its sweeping 9-dash line claim in the South China Sea. This year’s APEC also marks the first time that Marcos Jr. and Xi would meet in person since January 2023, when the Filipino leader traveled to Beijing for a state visit in an attempt to amicably settle disputes in the strategic waterway where trillions-worth of goods pass through annually. The Summit is being held in Gyeongju — South Korea’s ancient capital — where consensus building has been honored for centuries, Lee said. “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” Lee said, noting that “free trade is facing wild changes” while “uncertainties are growing for the global economy, and trade and investment is losing its vitality.” ADVERTISEMENT “[But] The Hwabaek spirit does not enforce any single idea but rather strive to achieve a harmony of different voices, exploring the path for harmony and coexistence,” he said. “The more we become connected and the more open we become to one another, the further we can go down the path of prosperity.” The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said that Marcos Jr. is not expected to have a bilateral meeting with Xi on the sidelines of the APEC 2025, saying that this forum traditionally focuses on economic and trade issues, instead of security and defense. On October 30, Marcos Jr. told Filipinos here that he would focus on wooing investors from APEC economies to help boost the Philippines’ tech industry as the world further shifts to digitalization and artificial intelligence. Marcos Jr. has described the APEC as a “very important” meeting, underscoring that the regional bloc represents over 80 percent of the Philippines’ trade.",

DFA Deputy Assistant Secretary Raphael Hermoso was tasked to summon Chinese Embassy’s Charge d’Affaires Zhou Zhiyong to lodge the protest, while DFA Undersecretary for Bilateral Relations and ASEAN Affairs Ma. Theresa Lazaro had a telephone call with Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Chen Xiaodong to express the Philippines' outrage over the incident. The Philippine Embassy in Beijing has also been instructed to lodge the same demarche with the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It infringes upon the Philippines’ sovereign rights and jurisdiction,\" the DFA added. The DFA said that China has failed to do its part to \"lower tensions\" in the West Philippine Sea, \"contradicting\" regional efforts for \"peace and cooperation.\" Meanwhile, China Coast Guard spokesperson Gan Yu insisted that the Philippines’ resupply and rotation mission is “irregular” and an intrusion into areas which China claims as territory. It further accused the vessels of bringing in construction materials. The US, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other security partners have called out previous attempts by Chinese vessels to impede Philippine boats in the West Philippines with aggressive maneuvers and water cannon.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Health is reviving its push to redefine the term \"fully vaccinated\" by including a booster shot against COVID-19. According to DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire, the agency is concerned with the low uptake of booster shots and waning immunity as cases of omicron subvariants increase. \"We are now again proposing to the Office of the President that our fully vaccinated definition be refined, that we will now include the first booster shot,\" she told ANC's \"Headstart\" on Wednesday. The DOH made a similar proposal to the previous administration but the plan was postponed to prioritize the reopening of the country's economy. ADVERTISEMENT In surveys conducted by the agency, it found out that Filipinos have not only gotten hesitant in getting the additional jab, they have become complacent, too. \"They are already confident with their first 2 doses and that because there are not much severe and critical [cases], so they say that enough na 'yung 2 doses nila,\" Vergeire said. Another reason cited by respondents was that booster shots are not required in offices or schools, she added. On Tuesday, the country recorded 924 additional cases of highly transmissible omicron subvariants BA.5, BA.4, and BA.2.12.1. In particular, the BA.5 subvariant is contributing to the continued increase in the number of cases, Vergeire said. But she noted that evidence suggests the omicron subvariant will not cause severe infection. ADVERTISEMENT \"So, we are very hopeful that even though cases are increasing, we can still manage and our healthcare system will not be overwhelmed,\" Vergeire added. The administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has pledged to administer COVID-19 booster shots to 23 million eligible individuals in its first 100 days. As of Monday, some 71.9 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated. Of the figure, 16.6 million have received an additional dose, while 1.5 million have received a second booster.",

MANILA — The police Highway Patrol Group on Friday inspected major bus terminals in San Juan and Quezon City to check for compliance with road safety guiedlines as thousands of passengers travel for Undas. Police Col. Hansel Marantan, HPG chief, said the terminals and the buses there \"satisfied the substantial compliance” after inspection for cleanliness, license plates, and tire condition. Tires “should not be more than four or five years old, otherwise it becomes brittle and can cause accidents,” he added. He added that apart from minor violations, most terminals have shown full compliance with safety standards. “So far, everything is within expectations,” he concluded.

He emphasized bus drivers must exercise “extra diligence” since they are carrying dozens of passengers who depend on them for a safe trip. “If you are not in your normal state while driving, you might cause an accident,” he said. The Philippine National Police, Land Transportation Office, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and Coast Guard have been conducting random drug tests and surprise inspections in recent days, which, Marantan said, has prompted higher compliance with safety rules. “It’s a good measure.

    "article_body": "MANILA — A ranking Philippine Navy official on Wednesday said that deterrence is not solely about weapon systems, but also encompasses other factors, such as the will of the people, military capabilities and alliances. Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, PN spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, was responding to questions about the possible deterrence effect of the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System or NMESIS, which US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to deploy to the Philippines to counter China’s presence in the region. During Hegseth’s visit to Manila in March, the Philippines and the US agreed that one of the key initiatives to accelerate their longstanding defense partnership is the deployment of more advanced US military capabilities in the country. This includes the NMESIS, a high mobile coastal anti-ship missile with the ability to strike hostile surface vessels from land-based positions. ADVERTISEMENT The training and testing of the NMESIS will be integrated into the Balikatan exercises, the annual bilateral drills between Philippine and US forces, this April and May. “Deterrence is more than just one missile system; it is an integration of different elements composed of but not limited to the will of the people, military capability, national leadership, and our alliances with like-minded states,” Trinidad said in a statement. But Trinidad did not say when the NMESIS missile system is expected to arrive in the country. This year’s Balikatan exercises will run from April 21 to May 9. National democratic activist groups oppose the annual military exercises as well as the presence of foreign troops in the Philippines, saying these keep the country dependent on foreign powers and puts it at risk of being caught up in geopolitical rivalries and potential conflict. ADVERTISEMENT In a statement on Araw ng Kagitingan to commemorate the Fall of Bataan during World War II, Kabataan party-list said the Philippines should honor the thousands who died by making sure the country is not used as a staging ground for war by foreigners. “Kaya pagtalikod sa alaala ng mga bayani sa Bataan ang pagbigay daan ni [President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] na muling gamitin ng US ang bansa natin sa pamamagitan ng [Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement] sites, [Visiting Forces Agreement] at ang Balikatan Exercises para gawing baseng pandigma muli tayo sa Asya-Pasipiko,\" she also said.

    "article_body": "MANILA -- The Department of Science and Technology has offered solutions to address bed bug infestations in wooden and metal furniture in some public facilities, including the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The local innovations look to enhance furniture made from indigenous materials, such as rattan. DOST-FPRDI has studied various methods to protect non-timber forest products (NTFPs) against biodeterioration agents—from processing, storage, and transit. They said one method is applying wood preservatives to freshly cut and conditioned materials. Another approach involves non-chemical control methods, such as kiln drying, to achieve low moisture content and ensure proper drying of raw materials. The DOST is also researching eco-friendly ways to safeguard wood and NTFPs, one of which is through thermal modification. ADVERTISEMENT “This news may have caused apprehension towards using rattan and other non-timber forest products for furniture, but Department of Science and Technology’s Forest Products Research and Development Institute (DOST-FPRDI) would like to clarify that technologies and methods are available to prolong their service life,” said Rico J. Cabangon, DOST-FPRDI Officer-in-Charge, in a statement. According to Cabangon, bed bugs are generally attracted to the woven pattern of wicker furniture, like rattan, not the material itself. Bed bugs thrive in items with tiny cracks and crevices, regardless of the material—whether rattan, metal, cloth, or concrete. Apart from bed bugs, rattan furniture can also be infested with biodeterioration agents such as fungi, termites, and powder-post beetles or bukbok. “Rattan is one of the leading raw materials used in furniture and handicraft products. It is often combined with metals and wood to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Like any lignocellulosic material, rattan furniture and handicrafts are prone to attacks from biodeterioration agents. Proper maintenance is key to using indigenous materials like rattan,” Cabangon added. “Thermal modification uses high heat to change the kind of chemicals present in a piece of wood,\" said According to DOST Scientist Juanito P. Jimenez. \"This makes the material more durable as it becomes more stable (more weather-proof, less prone to swelling and shrinking) and less appetizing to termites.” ADVERTISEMENT DOST-FPRDI recommends minimizing exposure of treated materials to prolonged wetting to extend their service life. “We urge the public not to be discouraged in using furniture made from rattan and other NTFPs. It is a triumph of Filipino ingenuity that indigenous materials have been showcased for public use in NAIA. Through science, technology, and innovation, we can continue to take pleasure in bug-free Filipino craftsmanship,” said Cabangon. DOST's suggestions come after several cases of infestation, including bed bugs, rodents were reported at the NAIA Terminal 3. The sightings of bed bugs and rats roaming NAIA have gone viral. In response, the Manila International Airport Authority has brought in 38 new steel gang chairs at the terminal to replace the 30 old ones the MIAA pulled out for being infested with bed bugs.",

ADVERTISEMENT Tapales also reported that since the anti-OSAEM/CSAEM Act have been enacted in 2022, there has been around 200 convictions of perpetrators of such kind of child abuse. “Maaaring tumaas na rin po itong data na ito kasi if I remember correctly April 2024 data po ito. Pero marami pong cases na naka-file – 750 cases filed since 2009 noong Anti-Pornography Act pa, pero 200 convictions coming after the enactment of the Anti-OSAEC and CSEAM Act,” he said Meanwhile, several government agencies including LGUs are set to put in place a range of mandatory services for victims of child sexual abuse or exploitation, which include the provision of emergency shelter or appropriate housing, counselling, free legal services, medical and psychosocial services, livelihood skills training and educational assistance. “Ang DSWD po, DOJ ay mayroon pong niluluto ngayon at binubuo at pina-finalize na plano na magkaroon talaga ng one-stop shop na system po kung saan ang biktima ay puwedeng dalhin po diyan sa isang lugar na iyan at nandoon na lahat ang puwedeng kumausap sa kaniya, pag-provide po ng relief at intervention. So, pinaplantsa po iyan, ina-iron out po natin ang mga gusot para talagang kapag mayroon talagang biktima at hindi maiiwasan, iyan po ay malalapatan ng appropriate relief and intervention at the soonest possible time,” he said. “So, talaga pong whole-of-government approach, whole-of-society approach po ang ginagawa po natin diyan dahil po talaga mainit na tinututukan ito ng ating mahal na pangulo.”",

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "Satellite images obtained by Reuters on Thursday, November 28, show a build-up of Chinese civilian vessels near contested Thitu Island, Manila’s key outpost in the South China Sea, but a senior Philippine navy officer said they are “not a cause for concern.” One of the images taken by Maxar Technologies on Monday and reviewed by Reuters shows about 60 vessels, some within 2 nautical miles of Pag-asa Island (Thitu Island), a strategically important island from which Manila monitors Chinese vessels and aircraft in the busy waterway. Vice Admiral Alfonso Torres, chief of the Philippines’ Western Command, said it was common for “maritime militia” ships to gather in the area. Manila, the Pentagon, and foreign diplomats say such vessels work with the Chinese coast guard and navy to strengthen Beijing’s presence in disputed waters. Rear Admiral Roy Trinidad, Philippine Navy spokesman for the South China Sea, also said maritime militia ships were regularly in the area, adding that Manila was aware of the vessels, which he called an “illegal presence”, but there was no need for alarm. “It’s not a cause for concern,” Trinidad said. “We don’t have to read every action and react to that… What is important for us is to maintain our posture.” Online ship trackers show that many of the vessels in the satellite photos are Chinese-registered fishing craft. The Chinese defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. China has never confirmed it has a militia of civilian vessels. The island, which the Philippines calls Pag-Asa, is Manila’s biggest and most strategically important in the disputed South China Sea, which is largely claimed by China and through which billions of dollars worth of goods pass each year. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that Beijing’s expansive claims had no basis under international law. The build-up comes after months of clashes and rammings between Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels and Philippines ships, particularly at the Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals. Thitu is close to a Chinese naval base and runway on Subi reef, which has sometimes served as a port for large numbers of Chinese maritime militia vessels, Trinidad said. “When you go in there (to Subi), when you go out, you will pass through the territorial sea of Pag-Asa,” he said. Regional diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, with some noting the Chinese vessels had their transponders on this week, allowing them to be tracked. Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh said Beijing could be testing Manila’s reactions at a moment of domestic political tension in the Philippines. Embattled Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday accused President Ferdinand Marcos Jr of seeking to remove her from office, after the national police filed a formal complaint accusing her of assault and coercion. “This needs to be watched in the days ahead,” said Koh, of Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. If the militia presence continues, Koh said, it could be that China is hoping to delay Philippine construction work on the island. A new aircraft hangar is reportedly due for completion in the next few weeks, the latest in a several moves to buttress the Philippines’ presence on Thitu and improve monitoring capabilities. – Rappler.com",

In its 2023 audit report dated April 25, the PCGG’s audit team said that these properties are not facing any contest since “ownership has finally been decided in favor of the government.” The agency, established after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship, is mandated to recover the wealth stolen by the Marcos family and individuals linked to the late dictator. His son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., is the incumbent Philippine president. The assets and properties that were “voluntarily surrendered, assigned, or ceded or waived to the commission as ill-gotten wealth, or through settlement or after judicial determination” include real estate linked to cronies J.Y. Campos, Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Martel, Simplicio Palanca, Alejo Ganut Jr. and Jolly Bugarin. The PCGG said that its asset management department worked with several appraisal companies to determine the latest valuation of these properties. One of the high-value items are two adjoining lots in Ortigas Center, Pasig City that have an assessed value of P70.63 billion in 2023. It is where the Payanig sa Pasig Amusement Park used to stand before being replaced by Metrowalk. Others include six Piedras lots worth P1.086 billion, a property in General Mariano Alvarez in Cavite worth P328.77 million, and a lot previously occupied by Banahaw Broadcasting in Naga City with a value of P89.28 million. These are all valued based on 2023 rates. The five remaining properties are currently valued using 2022 appraisals. These include a property managed by Bacolod Real Estate Development Corporation worth P569.85 million, a P13.076-million lot in Tagaytay City, land in Puerto Galera worth P6.7 million, property in Caloocan City worth P3.7 million, and property in Calapan, Oriental Mindoro P1.17 million. The PCGG has so far recovered P280 billion cash and non-cash ill-gotten wealth, according to its 2023 accomplishment report. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Thursday, December 1, that the status quo remains in the health and defense departments – two portfolios that are headed by officers-in-charge. “We just go to the process,” said Marcos in a chance interview on Thursday, December 1, when asked for updates on the appointment of officers-in-charge in his Cabinet. “So let’s be patient. Basta’t na… Ako, ang concern ko lang ‘yung kailangang gawin na trabaho, nagagawa? So far naman, nagagawa,” he added. (My concern is that if people are doing their jobs. So far, they’re doing their jobs.) At least three departments or offices headed by a Secretary are occupied by officers-in-charge: the Department of Health, Department of National Defense (DND), and the Office of the Press Secretary. “Wala pa kaming DOH. Wala pa kaming inino-nominate (We don’t have a nominee for DOH yet). Usec. Vergeire is doing a fine job,” said Marcos, referring to Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire, who was designated officer-in-charge weeks after the new administration began took over. Marcos also said he was “happy with the situation [in the DND] as it is now.” The DND administers the country’s military force and the Office of Civil Defense, an agency tasked with civil defense and disaster risk reduction. It is currently headed by former armed forces chief Jose Faustino, designated Senior Undersecretary and Office-in-Charge Still, the President did not rule out changes when 2023 rolls in. “These things are revisited especially every year at the end of the first year. I don’t think that’s any — that’s a secret to anyone that at the end of the first year, ‘yung mga ibang kandidato (the other candidates), they will now join the mix of possible nominees,” he said. There’s another department that critics and allies alike have said needs a full-time post: agriculture, which Marcos holds concurrently. The President has said that he has a checklist of things he wants to accomplish before finding an agri chief, although he did not say what were these goals. Delays and backlogs in permanent appointments – from the heads of major Cabinet posts, middle management in the bureaucracy, and non-Career Executive Service Officer (CESO) occupying CESO posts – is a major sore point in the Marcos administration. His short-lived first executive secretary, Vic Rodriguez, was criticized for being the supposed cause of the delays. Rodriguez, Marcos’ campaign spokesperson during the May elections, has since been kicked out of the President’s party for supposedly failing to accommodate their party-mates in government posts. His replacement, former chief justice Lucas Bersamin, issued a memorandum circular that expanded the powers of these interim appointments, allowing them to enter into new contracts and projects, among others. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, who once punched a court sheriff in a fit of rage when she was mayor of Davao City, advised teachers on Thursday, March 21, to pause when they are about to lose their cool while conducting their classes. The Vice President made the statement when asked about her reaction to a viral video of a teacher berating her students live on TikTok. “Ang una kong naging reaksiyon ay tao lang ‘yung teacher. Lahat tayo umaabot sa punto na nagagalit tayo lalo kapag na fru-frustrate tayo,” Duterte told reporters in an ambush interview in Cambodia. (My first reaction was – the teacher is just a human. We all reach a point where we get angry especially when we’e frustrated.) She said no penalties were imposed on the teacher, but added that she would be reprimanded by her regional director. “I saw her explanation. And then, I instructed the regional office that there will be no penalties for the teacher. Just to remind the teacher, if she’s angry, she has to pause. Pause the class. If she’s not angry anymore, she can resume the class. There’s a need to pause, if the teacher is angry,” Duterte said in a mix of English and Filipino. Duterte’s Zen-like advice was a stark contrast to her throwing a tantrum and punching a Davao Regional Trial Court sheriff during a demolition of houses over a decade ago in Davao City when she was mayor. The Department of Education (DepEd) said on Monday, March 18, it issued a show cause order to the erring teacher. According to DepEd order No. 40 series of 2012, child abuse in schools includes an “act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.” The Vice President said that teachers are trained for psychosocial support. Students who felt anxious and stressed about the incident will undergo debriefing sessions. The DepEd has identified bullying as one of the reasons for the prevailing learning crisis and one of the factors why the Philippines performed poorly in global education assessment. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has ordered the 90-day suspension of National Defense College Executive Vice President Aldrin Cuña over a graft case involving an alleged anomalous Quezon City project when he was the city’s administrator. The Sandiganbayan Third Division’s order, promulgated on April 3, takes effect immediately upon service of the directive. The court furnished Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. a copy of the six-page resolution for implementation. It directed the defense chief to inform it about actions taken in relation to the order within five days. The resolution was penned by Presiding Justice and Third Division chairperson Amparo M. Cabotaje-Tang with concurrences from Associate Justice Bernelito R. Fernandez and Associate Justice Ronald B. Moreno. Cuña’s suspension stemmed from a 2023 graft case filed against him as co-accused of former Quezon City mayor Herbert Bautista. They are accused of causing undue injury to the city government by allegedly favoring contractors Cygnet Energy and Power Asia, Incorporated despite noncompliance with documentary requirements and procedures, in violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. In December 2023, the Sandiganbayan gave Cuña a non-extendible 10-day period to explain why he should not be placed under preventive suspension. Cuña, however, did not file any pleading so the court declared that he had waived his right to contest the his preventive suspension “Verily, once the Information is found to be sufficient in form and substance, the court must issue the order of suspension as a matter of course. There are no ifs or buts about it,” the court said. It stressed that the preventive suspension is not a penalty and that the defendant is entitled to reinstatement and payment of salaries and benefits withheld during suspension if he is eventually acquitted. “In this case, there is absolutely no question to the validity of the subject Information. Accused Cuña is now serving as the Executive Vice President of the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP). Thus, his preventive suspension should now follow as a matter of course,” the court said. In the graft case, Ombudsman investigators alleged that Bautista and Cuña approved the contract worth P25.34-million in favor of Cygnet, meant for installing solar power and waterproofing systems of Civic Center Building F. Cygnet received the payment for the project despite not being entitled to it, the Ombudsman said, because it “failed to apply for and secure a Net Metering System from Meralco,” which was a mandatory requirement under the terms of reference and the supply and delivery agreement. – Rappler.com",

The figures are “too high” with notable increase of 264% compared to the same period of last year, which had only 5,711 with 25 deaths. The health officials also said the new cases just of last week reached 2,758. Dr. Bea Camille Natalaray, DOH 6’s program medical coordinator for emerging and re-emerging infectious disease, said the Iloilo Province topped the list for having the most number of dengue cases at 8,039 with 23 deaths. Negros Occidental followed with 3, 296 cases with 10 deaths, Capiz with 2, 104 with five deaths, Aklan – 2, 103 with three deaths, Guimaras – 1, 668 with one death, Iloilo City – 1,407 with four deaths, Antique – 1, 111 with two deaths, and Bacolod City – 1,086 with three deaths. Natalaray also said some 998 barangays in the Western Visayas have also clustering of dengue cases, and 21 were already classified as “hot spot” villages. As to the admission of dengue cases in various hospitals in the region, Natalaray said that based on their monitoring, the current rate ranges from 70 to 72% utilization. Health Undersecretary Dr. Mary Ann Palermo-Maestral told Rappler on Wednesday, September 11, however, said dengue awareness have had started to increase in the region. Aside from fogging or spraying operations being conducted by almost all local government units in the region, there were also some activities being done to drum up public awareness against dengue, she said. “Thus, two to three weeks from now, I am sure, there will be a decrease in dengue cases in the entire region,” Maestral said. Maestral still warned both Ilonggos and Negrenses not to resort to indigenous treatment of dengue fever like using extracts from tawa-tawa (wild grass) or juvenile papaya leaves. Rather, she advises the public to seek early consultation or treatment so proper cure can be administered to any dengue patients. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – A sharp decline in Davao Oriental’s revenue share from the national government has led to the provincial government’s decision to give up the management of a P289-million irrigation system to the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). Davao Oriental Governor Corazon Malanyaon said the province was unable to bear the system’s operating and maintenance costs due to the capitol’s reduced 2023 annual budget. The provincial government only spends an average of over P1 million annually to manage the Cateel irrigation system, but repairs and rehabilitation costs are too high for the provincial to handle, according to Emilia Barrera, the head of the local finance committee. Davao Oriental provincial board member Rotchie Ravelo, a former provincial agriculturist, said, “With our small budget, it is so expensive to run it.” The Cateel irrigation system was built nine years ago to aid rice farmers. Also known as the Aragon Dam, it was designed to water 4,000 hectares of rice fields, but currently serves only 1,600 hectares due to damage to its right canal. The provincial government’s technical team stated that the dam’s optimal economic life is only five years, making it necessary for the NIA to take over. Edito Sumile, the provincial agriculturist, said, “To really make it functional and cover an area of 4,000 hectares, it will really require a huge amount, beyond the capacity of the province to shoulder for now.” The province’s budget for 2023 is some P2.3 billion, a decrease from 2022’s more than P2.7 billion, said Vice Governor Nino Sotero Uy. The capitol’s annual revenue decline was further compounded by the economic impact of COVID-19, officials said. “Delaying the repair and turnover of the Cateel irrigation project would also delay progress in this area,” said Abel James Monteagudo, the director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in the Davao Region. Malanyaon said the transfer of the project, which she referred to as her legacy, was necessary for the best interest of local farmers and the province’s goal of achieving food security. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Monday, February 17, issued an administrative order requiring mining firms to include biodiversity conservation and climate action in their social development management programs. The DENR noted in a statement on Monday, February 17, that in the past, these particular programs were not required in mining firms’ plans. Environment Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga said they are also looking at “labor practices, gender equity, social services along with reforestation, rehabilitation, restoration of ecosystems to address biodiversity loss.” “The goal is to ensure that the wealth generated from mineral extraction is shared equitably, that ecosystems are protected, and that local communities gain empowerment,” Loyzaga said. Mining firms are required to come up with a five-year development program to improve the living standards of their host communities. This usually includes the construction of schools, hospitals, and housing projects. The extractive industry, associated with environmental damage, plays a critical role in the world’s transition to clean energy technologies. There is rising demand for critical minerals like copper, nickel, cobalt — used in manufacturing electric vehicles, battery storages, and wind turbines, among others. The department order requires mining companies to incorporate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aim to eradicate poverty by 2030. In a statement on Tuesday, February 18, the Philippine Nickel Industry Association (PNIA) welcomed the order from the DENR, saying they have been “long…ahead of the curve” in sustainability policies. In 2023, for example, PNIA said its members invested P4.3 billion in development projects “including the planting of nearly 4.3 million trees.” “As the Philippines continues to be a major player in global nickel production, PNIA reaffirms its commitment to responsible mining practices and to advancing the SDGs,” the business group said. The UN set the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, replacing the Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000. These include ending poverty and hunger; ensuring good health, quality education, clean water and energy; promoting decent work; building resilient infrastructure; reducing inequality; making sustainable cities and communities, among others. In 2024, the UN reported that the world was “severely off track” in achieving the SDGs. “It finds that only 17 per cent of the SDG targets are on track, nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress, and progress on over one-third has stalled or even regressed,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres.

    "article_body": "TACLOBAN CITY, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered all government agencies to fast-track relief operations and other assistance needed by victims of the recent flash floods in the provinces of Northern Samar and Eastern Samar. Marcos was set to visit Northern Samar but the bad weather in Catarman town, Northern Samar prevented him from leaving. Instead, the president had his situational briefing with Samar local officials via zoom in Tacloban City Thursday morning, November 23. Marcos also ordered the Department of Public Works and Highways to make sure all the roads are clear for the faster distribution of relief goods for flood victims. “We are doing everything that we can. But let’s work with those who are in the evacuation centers – pati na ‘yung mg nasa bahay pa (even those still at their homes) – we have to go and make sure that they get the food packs, they get sufficient water supply,” he said. Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian assured that they have already prepared over 100,000 food packs for distribution to the affected families in Eastern and Northern Samar. The DSWD was also finalizing the list of affected families and individuals whose houses were either totally or partially damaged as the basis of the financial assistance the flood victims will receive from the government to start rebuilding their houses. Marcos instructed the Department of Agriculture to provide the necessary assistance to affected families and distribute seedlings and agricultural products. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Eastern Samar declared Wednesday a state of calamity over their entire province due to the persistent rainfall and massive flooding. Initial reports from Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office of Eastern Samar said 12,817 families or 48,733 individuals were affected by flooding. And three were reported injured in Jipapad town. The provincial government of Eastern Samar is continuously monitoring and assessing the damage caused by flooding and landslides in different areas of the province. Provincial Administrator Nelson Cortez said that relief goods will be sent to affected families in the province early Friday morning. Meanwhile, as of 7 pm today the DPWH Eastern Samar said the national road at Brgy. Bigo, Arteche is now passable to all vehicles, as the flood has already subsided. Eson Gatchalian Espeso, information officer of DPWH Eastern Samar advised motorists to drive carefully especially when passing areas with ongoing clearing operations. – Rappler.com",

    "date_published": "2023-01-18T14:49:07+00:00",
    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – In early December 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. granted Naida Angping’s leave after she asked for “personal time for herself and her family.” Just a little over a month later, the former Presidential Management Staff (PMS) chief and long-time aide to the Marcos-Romualdez clan is ending the “time off” she had wanted for a plum post in Paris as the Philippines’ ambassador to France. Angping’s nomination to the post was forwarded to the Commission on Appointments on Tuesday, January 17. According to the Commission on Appointments, she was appointed on January 13, 2023. She has not held a diplomatic post before this. Angping, if confirmed, will take the place of Ambassador Junever Mahilum-West, a career diplomat who had only been appointed to the post in October 2021. Mahilum-West herself announced she was leaving the post on Thursday night, January 11 (Manila time), through a public post on Facebook. “Enjoyed Paris too briefly,” Mahilum-West said, adding her next assignment would be in Vancouver, Canada. The Philippines currently has a consulate in Vancouver, which had been led by another career diplomat, Maria Andrelita Austria. Austria was recently confirmed as the Philippines’ ambassador to Canada in December 2022. She will hold office in the Philippine embassy in Ottawa. Angping is no stranger to politics, especially in relation to the President’s family. A former Manila congresswoman, she was a long-time aide to the late Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez, the father of House Speaker Martin Romualdez. Kokoy is the brother of former first lady Imelda Marcos, the President’s mother. When the then-Marcos transition team first announced Angping’s appointment as PMS chief, they hyped her experience as aide to the late Kokoy Romualdez, who was once the country’s envoy to the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia. She was also his aide when Kokoy Romualdez was Leyte governor. During the 2022 campaign, Angping served as Marcos’ “disbursing officer,” the President himself said in a leaked video of his speech at his victory party with campaign staff. That she was picked to head the PMS – an office tasked to help the President make well-informed decision, follow-up on tasks assigned to key officials, and set the agenda for Cabinet meetings – isn’t surprising, given her ties to the Marcos-Romualdez clan. But mere months in her new role, there was also talk among Malacañang insiders that the PMS chief was not performing, and was frequently absent, save for her appearance in Marcos’ public events. Her leave came after her husband Harry Angping, himself a former legislator, was allegedly caught harassing a staff member of a Bangkok hotel where Marcos and his delegation were billeted during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Bangkok. The Palace then – and even until now – refused to comment on the reports. Only a high-ranking official, speaking only on background, denied the supposed arrest of the PMS chief’s husband. Thai police denied the arrest as well. Prior to Angping’s appointment as ambassador, Malacañang was mum on her status, even as a new executive order “streamlined” the offices under the Office of the President. – with reports from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — “Never again, never again! Never again to Martial Law!” This was the recurring chant of progressive organizations that gathered at Liwasang Bonifacio in Ermita, Manila, for the 51st anniversary of the declaration of Martial Law on Thursday, September 21. But the day was more than just a time of remembering, the organizers of the program said. Now that another Marcos is in power, September 21 has become a day of demanding reparations from the Marcoses. “Tayo ay hindi nakakalimot,” said Menchani Tilendo, one of the hosts of the program. “Tayo ay naniningil.” (“We do not forget. We want restitution.”) The namesake and father of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared martial law half a century ago. Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 and only lifted martial rule after nine years in 1981. For almost a decade, the period was marked by thousands of killings, imprisonments, torture, and human rights violations. Human rights groups, women and environmental activists, representatives of farmers, jeepney drivers, and students continue to denounce the many human rights violations and enforced disappearances that happened during Martial Law. “Nagniningning ang pakikibaka ng mamamayan mula noong diktadurang Marcos hanggang sa kasalukuyang Marcos,” Cristina Palabay, secretary-general of human rights organization Karapatan, said on Thursday. (The struggle of the people continue to shine from the Marcos dictatorship until the current Marcos administration.) The 51st anniversary coincides with Marcos’ second year in office, already beset by problems such as the rising prices of basic goods, food security. Malacañang did not release a statement on the anniversary. In other parts of the Philippines, such as in Baguio, Cebu City, Tacloban, groups also staged pockets of protests. Among the current issues harking back to the terrors of Martial Law was the recent disappearance of two environmental activists Jonila Castro and Jhed Tamano. Castro and Tamano recently surfaced after appearing in a presser led by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, where they said they were abducted by the military. Palabay, who was one of the individuals who sounded the alarm on the reported abduction of two environmental activists, said much has to be learned from the women who “fight against all forms of machismo and oppression.” “Ang hamon sa atin ay maging kasing tapang ni Jonila at Jhed.” (The challenge for us is to be as brave as Jonila and Jhed.) The Marcos era was marked both by the rise of many youth activists, and concurrently, the many disappearances of those critical of the government. Huge canvases of the faces of killed Martial Law activists line one part of the plaza. Among them are student leaders Liliosa Hilao, Emmanuel Lacaba, and Lorena Barros. — Rappler.com",

    "date_published": "2023-07-14T05:58:05+00:00",
    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) spent P3.336 billion in 2022 on garbage collection, nearly double compared to what it shelled out in 2017. This is based on the agency’s environment/sanitary services expenses, which pertain to the “payment of fees to several entities contracted by the MMDA to collect garbage in various areas of Metro Manila.” In 2017, MMDA spent P1.764 billion for garbage collection, which rose to P1.990 billion in 2018. The MMDA spent P2.873 billion and P3.217 billion, in 2020 and 2021, respectively, for garbage collection. The agency’s expense for garbage collection breached the P3 billion mark in 2021. Although garbage collection is primarily the responsibility of local governments in Metro Manila, the agency is responsible for paying the tipping fees in sanitary landfills, MMDA acting chairperson Don Artes said in an Inquirer article. A tipping fee, also known as a gate fee, refers to the payment required from individuals or entities when they dispose of waste in a landfill. This fee is calculated based on the weight of the waste per ton. For nearly two decades since 2002, the tipping rates for waste disposal in landfills remained unchanged at P171 per cubic meter. In 2018, three contracted landfills – San Mateo sanitary landfill; International Swims Incorporated in Rodriguez, Rizal; Phileco at the Navotas landfill – sent a letter requesting a 100-percent increase in tipping fees. Their reasons included the rise in gas prices and the peso-dollar exchange rate. The MMDA sought additional funds from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in 2019 to accommodate the increase, and the DBM approved a 50% hike, considering it a reasonable adjustment. As a result, the tipping fee rose from P171 to P257 per cubic meter. Artes clarified that this increase was not due to higher expenditures but rather the approval granted by the DBM to pay 50% more in fees. He also cited the increase in the volume of waste coming from food, and packaging from online shopping. Artes mentioned that while two of the contracted landfills could still accommodate waste, the one in Navotas may reach its full capacity within two to three years. To address the growing trash problem in Navotas, the MMDA is currently studying waste-to-energy conversion, with plans to complete the study within the year. The estimated waste generated in Metro Manila has been increasing through the years as its population continues to rise, according to data from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources- Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB). In 2019, DENR-EMB estimated that Metro Manila produced 9,333 tons of waste per day. From 2010 to 2019, Metro Manila was highest producer of waste in the country, except in 2016 and 2017. Since the enactment of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act over 20 years ago, solid waste generation in the country has consistently risen from 9.07 million metric tons in 2000 to 16.63 million metric tons in 2020. – Rappler.com",

Wala pong mangyayari. Talagang mananatili yung Speaker sa pwesto nya. (It will never happen to Speaker Romualdez. He will remain as Speaker of the House.)” He said the reason is the closeness of Speaker Romualdez and his cousin President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Alvarez, the representative of the 1st District of Davao del Norte, refused to speculate on why Vice President Sara Duterte left her political party LAKAS-CMD. “Sa ngayon, mahirap mag speculate, pero definitely cause and effect yan,” Alvarez said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said there was a 30% increase in dengue cases in the country since the rainy season began in May. The DOH provided the following data on dengue cases in the country from May 19 to June 19: “The DOH is cautious in interpreting case counts especially as regards the most recent tally (June 16 to 29) as there may be incoming late reports,” the DOH said in their statement on Tuesday, July 16. The department has identified seven regions with increasing dengue cases: Mimaropa, Cagayan Valley, Western Visayas, Ilocos Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and the National Capital Region. From January 1 to June 29, 90,119 cases have been tallied nationwide and 233 dengue-related deaths were recorded. This year’s tally of infections is so far 17% higher than the 75,968 infections recorded in the same period in 2023, which saw 291 deaths. The DOH said weekly case numbers in 2024 were higher than infections from January 1 to May 11, 2023. However, weekly cases from May 12 to June 29 either went below or just above the recorded number of infections in the same period in 2023, thanks to efforts of local government units. The DOH reminded the public to be cautious about the breeding waters available to mosquitoes. “Dengue cases are rising as expected due to the rainfall, which allows more water to pool and be stagnant,” the department said. “Left unchecked, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes responsible for spreading dengue will breed in these stagnant pools of water.” Dengue is mostly transmitted through a mosquito bite. However, one can also get infected through maternal transmission, blood products, organ donation, and blood transfusion. Symptoms of infection include having high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, and rashes. These symptoms typically appear around 4 to 10 days after getting infected. As the country braces itself for more rainfall, now that the state weather bureau has triggered the La Niña Alert, the DOH also reminded the public to take the following steps to protect themselves: – Rappler.com",

Abalos said he has instructed the National Police Commission (Napolcom) to initiate proceedings to revoke Guo’s powers over the local police after finding sufficient grounds to do so. “I have instructed Napolcom to initiate proceedings for the withdrawal of the mayor’s deputization,” said Abalos. “This means after this investigation, with sufficient grounds, we would withdraw the deputization of Mayor Guo as the consequences of the privileges attached are revoked immediately, including its control and supervision of its local police,” Abalos added, in a mix of Filipino and English. Napolcom told Rappler that they will begin procedures also on Monday. DILG Undersecretary Juan Victor Llamas said they have already filed their fact-finding report with the Office of the Ombudsman and added that they can also convert the report into a formal complaint upon request. “It’s just a matter of verifying under oath,” Llamas said during a press briefing held at Camp Crame on Monday. Llamas did not specify the details of their recommendation “out of deference to the Ombudsman.” However, he said, they have found serious legal implications on the case of Guo and other local officials in Bamban. Abalos said they have recommended the suspension of Guo to the Ombudsman for grave misconduct and gross negligence of duty in relation to issues surrounding Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGOs) in Barangay Anupul, Bamban, Tarlac. Guo is currently under scrutiny over her alleged links to two raided POGOs in Tarlac, including her suspicious background and identity which raised doubts about her citizenship following the Senate hearing held last May 7. The Office of the Solicitor General has also launched a probe to find information that could facilitate the filing of a quo warranto petition against Guo. While it is the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) that approves all POGOs, Abalos said it is still up to the local government units to allow their operations in their respective areas. Abalos reiterated that the DILG does not have the power to suspend, dismiss, or reprimand elected public officials. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Education (DepEd) announced on Monday, April 7, that it is granting teachers a 30-day “uninterrupted” and “flexible” vacation. Teachers can schedule their break between April 16 and June 1, either continuously or in staggered intervals. The DepEd set the last day of classes for the current school year as April 15. “This break is a well-deserved opportunity for our learners and teachers to relax after a long academic year. I hope they spend this time wisely, unwinding with their families and loved ones, and return to work energized for the new school year,” Education Secretary Sonny Angara said. During their break, teachers are not required to participate in any Performance Management Evaluation System (PMES) activities. They can submit their electronic Individual Performance Commitment and Review Form (eIPCRF) by the end of the first month of the next school year. Teachers applying for promotion may submit the required performance evaluations before the last day of classes. The DepEd also said any professional development activities are voluntary and should be scheduled outside the declared vacation period. “Teachers who engage in these activities will earn Vacation Service Credits (VSC) on top of the 30-day limit,” the department said. Teachers can also visit schools and participate in activities such as the May 2025 elections and sports events during their 30-day vacation. School heads are not covered by the vacation benefits, “as they are responsible for managing the school during the break.” But they are still entitled to vacation and sick leave credits. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines – The Cebu provincial government said Monday, April 3, it would file more complaints against personnel of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) for going against the province’s policies in dealing with the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak. The provincial government earlier sued BAI for abusing its authority and violating Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 by continuously implementing hog culling and color-coding of ASF-marked areas. Legal consultants of the provincial government said that the complaints would now include violations of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act after BAI released statements that declared 10 new ASF-marked red zones in the province. “These statements, the effect of these can present then injury against our hog industry, especially our backyard hog raisers,” provincial legal officer Donato Villa said. In previous reports, Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia deemed BAI’s practices as detrimental to the province’s P11-billion hog industry. On the other hand, experts from the Philippine Veterinary Medical Association (PVMA) said that these actions were internationally accepted and mandated by the Department of Agriculture. In response, Garcia criticized the PVMA’s statements for only citing circulars that held no ground against the local government’s autonomy. “Whether you’d be a national or an international association, you cannot infringe upon a local government unit’s territorial powers, as very expressly contained in the Local Government Code,” Garcia said in a statement. “On the part of the province, we have established much stringent and a very grassroots level approach in solving this crisis,” said capitol consultant on legal matters Ben Cabrido, citing the powers of LGU under RA 7160. Under Paragraph 5 (v) of Section 468 of Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, LGUs can approve measures and adopt quarantine regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases within its territorial jurisdiction. On March 21, Garcia issued Executive Order No. 10-2023, lifting all ASF border control measures in the province and nullifying the color-coding scheme. A day later, Garcia issued Memorandum No. 8-2023, allowing only province-approved veterinarians to conduct ASF testing on hogs. “We view the culling policy as arbitrary and violative of the due process clause of our constitution,” Cabrido said. Rory John Sepulveda, also a legal consultant of the provincial government, said that if BAI would like to continue issuing statements, hog culling, and color-coding of ASF-marked areas, the Cebu provincial government would file more cases against them. During the press conference, the governor also called out officials who accused provincial veterinarian Dr. Mary Rose Vingcoy at the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) of allegedly “committing unethical practices”. “Back off…Do not meddle with our position, which our own provincial veterinarian has adopted, belonging as she does to the Cebu Provincial Government,” Garcia said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) on Friday, December 1, inaugurated its “new and upgraded” Coast Kalayaan Island Group station in Pag-asa Island. In a statement, the PCG said the three-story building “will have advanced maritime domain awareness technology such as radar, automatic identification, satellite communication, coastal cameras, and vessel traffic management.” The new structure was built after Super Typhoon Odette completely damaged the original station in December 2021. Only the Philippine flag stood where the old station once was. Admiral Ronnie Gavan, commandant of the PCG, said the station’s systems would “significantly enhance the PCG’s capability to monitor the movements of Chinese maritime forces, as well as public vessels and aircraft,” according to a PCG release. The station could not have come at a more crucial time. The PCG is among the government agencies which has to deal with China’s aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea. Pag-asa or Thitu Island is the largest of the features administered by the Philippines in the Spratlys, an archipelago whose features are claimed by several countries, including China and the Philippines. Pag-asa is the farthest island territory of the Philippines and is located beyond its exclusive economic zone, or more than 200 nautical miles from its territorial baseline. The Philippines has occupied and administered Pag-asa island since 1971. In 1978, the municipality of Kalayaan on Pag-asa island was official established through a presidential decree. Present during the inauguration of the structure were National Security Adviser Eduardo Año, Presidential Adviser on the West Philippine Sea Andres Centino, Department of Transportation Undersecretary for Maritime Elmer Sarmiento, Department of Energy Undersecretary Giovanni Carlo Bacordo, Armed Forces of the Philippines Western Commander Vice Admiral Abeth Carlos, and other members of the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, said the PCG. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines has recorded its first case of monkeypox, the Department of Health (DOH) announced on Friday, July 29. DOH assistant spokesperson Beverly Ho made the announcement during the televised Malacañang press briefing. “The DOH has detected the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the country,” Ho said. The case involves a 31-year-old Filipino who arrived from abroad last July 19. Ho said the case had prior travel to countries with documented monkeypox cases. The case was tested via RT-PCR done at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine on July 28. The case has been discharged, and is undergoing strict isolation and monitoring at home. Ho said that 10 close contacts were traced – three from the same household are currently in quarantine. Ho said that close contacts are not exhibiting any symptoms. “All have been advised to quarantine and are being monitored by the department,” Ho added. Monkeypox is a virus that causes fever symptoms as well as a distinctive bumpy rash. It occurs primarily in the tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa but has been occasionally exported to other regions, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The DOH urged the public to continue observing minimum health standards, noting that the viral disease can be transmitted through close contact with an infected person, animal, or contaminated materials. Ho added that initial investigation of recent monkeypox cases in other non-endemic countries also indicate potential transmission through sexual contact. “It spreads mostly by intimate sexual contact with those who have rashes or open lesions. It’s not like COVID-19 that spreads through air,” Ho said. The DOH spokesperson said that they are “not divulging any more of the clinical information because that’s all within the purview of the specialist looking at them.” On July 23, the WHO declared monkeypox a global health emergency. WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said the spread of the disease made him decide that “the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.” Public health emergency of international concern is the highest alert level declared by WHO. It signals that a health emergency requires an international coordinated response. It motivates countries to devote resources, activate public health responses, and work across borders on vaccines or other medical treatments. Monkeypox is usually mild. It has two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe – with up to 10% mortality – and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate in about 1% of cases. The UK cases have been reported as the West African strain. Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, which may lead to a range of medical implications. — Rappler.com",

    "date_published": "2024-11-15T01:56:49+00:00",
    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is at a standstill in its efforts to collect millions in unpaid foreshore leases from the Oroquieta City government while a court weighs in on a foreshore land ownership dispute it has with the local government. A ruling this week from the Commission on Audit (COA) halted DENR’s claims of over P2.436 million in back rents. The DENR-Northern Mindanao’s petition hinges on seven foreshore lease agreements signed in 2003, granting the city government authority to use foreshore areas across several barangays. City hall, however, ceased payments after the first year, leading to years of accumulating debt, now calculated by the City Environment and Natural Resources Office at over P2.437 million. The legal impasse leaves the foreshore areas – and the funds at stake – in a limbo, awaiting judicial clarification on who truly owns the areas in question. COA Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba, along with Commissioners Roland Pondoc and Mario Lipana, said the DENR’s claim came prematurely, citing a declaratory relief petition pending before the Oroquieta City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 12. “This Commission dismisses the petition for being premature pending the resolution of the petition for declaratory relief. This claim is prematurely filed and not yet ripe for adjudication by this Commission,” read part of the COA ruling. At the center of the issue lies a legal debate over whether the foreshore areas fall under DENR’s domain or if they were ceded to Oroquieta based on Republic Act 5518, the city’s charter. The foreshore lease contracts, signed on January 31, 2003, covers a foreshore area in barangays Poblacion, Poblacion II Lower Loboc, Tabuc Norte and Sur, Canubay, San Vicente Bajo, and Mobod. Based on the agreements, the city government was supposed to pay an annual rent during a 25-year period. The DENR’s civil case seeks clarity on whether the 1969 legislation, which vests ownership of public lands in Oroquieta City, extends to foreshore areas. The outcome of the case is crucial for the DENR, whose claim was filed with COA in 2021 to compel the local government to fulfill its lease obligations. Oroquieta officials have argued that the RTC ruling on ownership will have to be made first before the contracts become enforceable. For now, COA has dismissed the petition, concluding that any adjudication on DENR’s claims remains “premature pending the resolution” of the court’s decision on ownership. “Apparently, there is an issue as to the ownership of the foreshore area which is already subject of a pending petition for declaratory relief before the RTC-Branch 12. Thus, it is appropriate for the declaratory relief to be resolved first for a judicial determination on the issue of ownership over the foreshore area,” the COA stated. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The administration’s Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilpinas is set to stage its “final rallying cry” in the home turf of one bet whose numbers have been wanting: Mandaluyong City. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is set to join his slate for a campaign rally along Nueve de Febrero Street in Mandaluyong City, the bailiwick of Alyansa senatorial bet and former interior secretary Benhur Abalos, on Friday, May 9. The city’s incumbent mayor, Ben Abalos, is the Senate candidate’s father. Benhur’s wife, Carmelita “Menchie” Abalos, is the incumbent vice mayor. Traffic advisories from the local city government advised motorists that Martinez, Nueve de Febrero, and New Fabella Road will be “closed to traffic for a political event” from May 8 to 9. Alyansa is an 11-person slate composed of the following candidates: The slate used to be composed of 12 persons, but reelectionist Senator Imee Marcos, the sister of the President, exited the slate after the arrest of Duterte. Of the 11, eight to nine are almost constantly part of the list of candidates statistically likely to make it on May 12. Depending on the survey, Abalos, Tolentino, Pacquiao, and Villar have seen themselves slip out of the so-called “Magic 12.” Nueve de Febrero is a site where Mandaluyong celebrates its liberation and founding day. “From the first rally in Laoag to the final stage in Mandaluyong, the message has been the same — Filipinos want a Senate that delivers for them,” said coalition campaign manager Navotas Representative Toby Tiangco. Alyansa had kicked off its national campaign in Laoag, Ilocos Norte, the bailiwick of Marcos and his clan. Marcos has joined 16 of the slate’s rallies — only missing a sortie in Pangasinan because he was in the Vatican for the funeral of Pope Francis. The President also joined his candidates in Cebu for a One Cebu rally hosted by Governor Gwen Garcia. Marcos, as chief campaigner of his 12-turned-11-person slate, has painted the elections as a choice between his administration and a “pro-China” and “bloody” Philippines under former president Rodrigo Duterte. Yet his bets have been careful not to upset the base of either clan, even after the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte and her father’s arrest. The Villars had been vocal of their disapproval over Duterte’s arrest. Camille, who is trying to be the fourth Villar senator, has skipped several of their sorties after former president Duterte’s arrest. Her absence continued after getting the endorsement of Vice President Duterte. – Rappler.com",

Santiago served as a Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge. Before he joined the judiciary, the new NBI director was a cop under the Manila Police District. He was known for being a sharpshooter in the Manila police. He replaced Medardo de Lemos, who was picked by Marcos to lead the NBI in 2022. De Lemos, a long-time career official, retired from service. Santiago took his oath before Bersamin on Friday morning. Aside from serving in Manila RTC, Santiago also had a stint as a presiding judge in Tagaytay City RTC. He also served as a judge of the Manila Metropolitan Trial Court, according to Santiago’s profile from the Philippine Judicial Academy. For three years, from October 2003 to December 2006, he was an assistant city prosecutor under the Department of Justice. The new NBI director was also the former deputy executive vice president of the Philippine Judges Association and former president of the Metropolitan and City Judges Association of the Philippines. As a cop, Santiago served as the deputy chief of the MPD’s Special Weapons and Tactics team. A decorated cop, the new NBI director received several awards such as the senior non-commissioned officer of the year of the then-Western Police District, as one of the Ten Outstanding Policemen of the Philippines, and an Act of Heroism Award given by the National Capital Region Police Office. Later, his life story made it into the big screen through the movie titled SPO4 Santiago Sharpshooter, portrayed by Senator Bong Revilla. Santiago obtained his law degree from Manuel L. Quezon University in 1993, and passed the Bar Examinations the following year with a score of 81.65%. The new NBI director was also a criminal law professor at the Philippine College of Criminology and the Emilio Aguinaldo College. – With reports from Dwight de Leon/ Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. sidestepped questions regarding his insistence not to say sorry for the atrocities committed during the Martial Law regime of his late father, the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. During the Foreign Correspondents’ Association of the Philippines (FOCAP) presidential luncheon on Monday, April 15, a reporter asked Marcos, “Why have you resisted issuing an apology for the atrocities committed during Martial Law under your father’s rule, and will you continue doing so as president?” “I don’t think it’s a duty for a president to be involved. That is a personal matter for the Marcos family,” he answered. “My role as president is more important right now than my role as a member of the Marcos family.” The reporter, seemingly unsatisfied with the answer, threw a follow-up at Marcos, “So will you apologize as president of the Republic in behalf?” “That seems highly contrived. Who is apologizing to whom?” Marcos replied, after which the subject has been dropped. Marcos, in the past, dismissed the idea of saying sorry for the sins committed by his father. “Will I say sorry for the thousands and thousands of kilometers [of roads] that were built? Will I say sorry for the agricultural policy that brought us to self-sufficiency in rice? Will I say sorry for the power generation? Will I say sorry for the highest literacy rate in Asia? What am I to say sorry about?” Marcos Jr. said in a 2015 interview. The presidency of Marcos Sr. from 1965 to 1986 became among the darkest chapters of Philippine history. His declaration of Martial Law in 1972 allowed him to stay in power beyond the two-term limit imposed by the 1935 Constitution. That era was marked by widespread corruption in government, suppression of various freedoms, and human rights violations. Amnesty International said 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed from 1972 to 1981. After the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution booted out Marcos Sr. and left his family no choice but to go intoexile in Hawaii, the succeeding government formed a body tasked to go after their ill-gotten wealth. As of 2021, the Presidential Commission on Good Government said P170 billion have been recovered but they are after P125 billion more. The Marcos family, however, has successfully reintegrated themselves in Philippine politics after the Corazon Aquino government allowed them to return home in 1991 to face the legal challenges against them. In 2022, Marcos Jr. won the presidential election in a landslide vote, with the help of what critics said was a well-oiled disinformation campaign to rehabilitate the family’s image. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will visit Australia not once but twice within a seven-day period from the last week of February to the first week of March. The first trip will be a state visit, while the second one will be for his participation in a special summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Here’s what you need to know. Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson Teresita Daza said on Tuesday, February 27, that Marcos will be in Canberra from Wednesday to Thursday, February 28 to 29, as a guest of the Australian government, upon the invitation of Australian Governor-General David Hurley. He will deliver a speech before the Australian Parliament during his time there, joining other heads of state who have addressed the country’s legislative body in the past – the United States’ Barack Obama and George W. Bush, China’s Xi Jinping, Britain’s Tony Blair, Japan’s Shinzo Abe, and Indonesia’s Joko Widodo. “He is expected to convey a shared vision and future with Australia under the ambit of the strategic partnership and informed by common history, long-standing people-to-people ties, and mutual adherence to the rules-based order and international law,” Daza said. Marcos will also sit down with senior Australian officials to discuss defense and security, trade and investments, multilateral cooperation, and regional issues, according to a press release of the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) on Saturday, February 24. “Similarly, the visit will witness the signing of new agreements in areas of common interest to complement the already robust cooperation with Australia and expand engagements for mutual capacity-building,” the PCO release also read. Marcos will fly home to the Philippines after his two-day state visit. Four days later, Marcos will again be back in Australia, but in a different city. Marcos will mingle with other Southeast Asian leaders in Melbourne for the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit, an event that will commemorate 50 years since the regional bloc established formal relations with its oldest dialogue partner. His schedule is as follows: The South China Sea dispute is also expected to be raised during the summit. According to the DFA, the President himself may thank the Australian government for continuously recognizing the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 arbitral award that ruled in favor of the Philippines and against China’s all-encompassing claim over the vast waterway. The DFA said documents that are expected to be produced from the summit include: The Philippines will also hold bilateral talks with Cambodia and New Zealand. Manila will take part in these organized working-level events as well: There are 408,000 Filipinos in Australia as of 2022, making the migrant community the fifth largest in the Land Down Under. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Rising temperatures prompted emergency responders to move to ensure the protection of over 5,000 Kanlaon Volcano eruption evacuees sheltering in makeshift facilities in La Castellana and La Carlota City. As temperatures climbed, Kabankalan Mayor Benjie Miranda and Himamaylan Mayor Raymund Tongson suspended all classes – public and private – at all education levels on Thursday, March 6, after the state weather bureau forecast that the temperature would feel like 40 degrees Celsius in some parts of Negros Occidental. In EB Magalona, Mayor Marvin Malacon suspended only afternoon classes. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) was right – the heat index was 40 degrees around 1 pm Thursday, according to Raul Fernandez, head of Task Force Kanlaon. Fernandez said he instructed all Regional Incident Management Team responders to ensure that all 13 evacuation centers in La Castellana and La Carlota had adequate ventilation to prevent health issues as temperatures rise this March. “I’ve told them to follow protocols in assisting the Kanlaon evacuees amid hot temperatures. I told them too to ensure that each evacuation center must have an ample supply of drinking water which is badly needed,” Fernandez added. On record, La Castellana still has nine active evacuation centers for its 4,400 remaining evacuees; La Carlota has four for 1,500 people, while Bago City has none. Bago evacuees have all been transferred to a relocation site in Barangay Napoles. Fernandez said that part of their mandate is to look after the health of the Kanlaon evacuees amid challenging conditions as temperatures rise. Since March 1, Task Force Kanlaon has been tracking weather conditions. Daily forecasts indicate that a high heat index – a measure of how hot it feels when humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature – is expected over the coming weeks. “We want to ensure that no evacuee will fall ill while at the evacuation center just because of the heat,” Fernandez said. Workers from the Department of Health in the Negros Island Region were also on alert because of the threat posed by the scorching heat. Dr. Girlie Pinongan, provincial health officer, called on residents to take precautions. PAGASA earlier advised people in Negros Occidental to take “extreme caution.” Pinongan said residents should stay cool indoors and avoid strenuous outdoor activities. She also urged Negrenses to immediately call emergency services or go to the nearest health facility if heat-related illnesses occur. Fernandez said all response mobility assets of the Office of Civil Defense and Task Force Kanlaon are ready for deployment, and medical supplies are available to respond to emergency situations. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines – Police have blamed a group of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) for the August 30 ambush that killed the police chief of Ampatuan town in Maguindanao province and his aide. Authorities said the ambush was the handiwork of a group led by one Abdulnasser Sabtulah Guianid and Guipar Abdulkarim a.k.a. Commander Boy Jacket, and composed of Sala Tunda, Johari Abdulbasser Guinaid, Phepe Saptulah, Abdulrah Sapal, and Bobot Kamsa. The group is known as the Karialan faction of the BIFF. Bangsamoro Local Governments Minister Naguib Sinarimbo assured that BARMM’s officials were helping the police in bringing the group behind the ambush to justice. Sinarimbo said BARMM Senior Minister Abdulraof Macacua, who is also the chief of staff of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), has instructed their ground commanders to help in pursuing the suspects. The revelation that a BIFF group was involved came even as a document surfaced about an alleged intelligence report that supposedly alerted authorities that Ampatuan police chief Lieutenant Reynaldo Samson was marked for death days before the ambush in the village of Kapinpilan on Tuesday. Samson and his aide, Corporal Salipudin Endab, were killed while three others – Senior Master Sergeant Reynante Quinalayo, and corporals Rogelio Dela Cuesta and Marc Clint Dayaday – were wounded when armed men sprayed their patrol vehicle with automatic gunfire. Samson’s team was headed back to their police station after they failed to locate Kamir Kambal, a man ordered arrested by a court concerning a robbery case when they were attacked in Sitio Pasio, Barangay Kapinpilan. Maguindanao police spokesperson Major Reggie Abillera said Samson and Endab were killed on the spot. “The volume of fire was directed at the vehicle’s front where they were seated,” he said. A police intelligence operative claimed his group submitted an intelligence report to their superiors as early as August 23 alerting them that the BIFF group led by Guianid planned to assassinate Samson. The intelligence report said the group was “out to liquidate Police Lieutenant Reynaldo Samson at any opportune time.” The exact reason for the alleged plot was unclear, but a copy of the intelligence report showed it had something to do with Samson’s “strict implementation of traffic rules and regulations” in Ampatuan town. The document could not be immediately validated, but hours after the ambush, Camp Crame replaced Maguindanao police director Colonel Christopher Panapan with Colonel Roel Rullan Sermese from the Soccsksargen regional police. Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. and PNP chief General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. went to Maguindanao on Wednesday, August 31, to confer Samson and Endab with posthumous awards. – Rappler.com",

We will not say that because there is no final investigation on that matter. But there is still ongoing investigation on that and we will just defer all the details to DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and to (Department of National Defense),” said Undersecretary Claire Castro in a briefing. On April 5, the NSC spokesperson Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya had said in a statement that the arrest of the three, Palawan locals who had previously been part of a learning exchange with the Chinese province of Hainan, “can be seen as a retaliation for the series of legitimate arrests of Chinese agents and accomplices by Philippine law enforcement and counter-intelligence agencies in recent months.” Beginning January 2025, Philippine law enforcement has publicized the arrest of both Chinese and even Filipino nationals over what investigators claim were acts of espionage against critical Philippine infrastructure, including military bases and waterways. Castro, press briefer for the Palace, said “legal assistance will always be given, all the necessary help and assistance will be provided.” The DFA had earlier said that it had been “formally made aware of the allegations against the three Filipinos who are currently detained in China.” “The Department has conveyed to the Chinese Government to ensure that these allegations are tried with due process and with full respect to the rights of the said Filipinos in accordance with domestic law and the Philippines-China Consular Agreement,” said DFA spokesperson Teresita Daza on April 4. Daza had confirmed in mid-March 2025 that three Palawan locals were under detention in China over allegations of espionage. In early April, China state media reported on the identity and status of the three detained Filipinos. The NSC, in its April 5 statement, said it was “alarmed” by the charges against the three, all former recipients of a Hainan Government Scholarship program created through a sister province arrangement with Palawan. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government secured a post-disaster loan of 30 billion yen (P11,818,122,000) and a grant aid 1.1 billion yen (P433,331,140) to procure a Satellite Data Communication System for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo and Japanese Ambassador Koshikawa Kazuhiko signed the exchange of notes on Tuesday, August 8, formalizing the loan and grant project under Japan’s Official Development Assistance. This is the third time that the Japanese government is giving the Philippines a post-disaster loan. The first loan was given in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda in 2013; while the second one was given in 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic response. Kazuhiko said they expect that the low interest funds of 0.01% per annum would give the Philippines elbow room to “execute more swift and flexible initial responses to severe disasters in the coming years.” “With Typhoon Egay having attacked the Philippines just last month, it is evident that our countries are frequently exposed to natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions,” said Kazuhiko on Tuesday. As an archipelagic country themselves, Kazuhiko said Japan understands how important maritime security is for the Philippines. Providing better maritime technology to the PCG is part of Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy that aims to foster stable relationships, freedom of navigation, free trade among ASEAN countries, India, Australia, and the US. The satellite project should improve PCG’s law enforcement capabilities, which can help secure the Sulu-Celebes Sea which has a history of piracy and terrorism. Sulu and Celebes Seas are bodies of water found southwest of the Philippines, with the Sulu archipelago coming in the middle. The Philippines is currently embroiled in territorial disputes, particularly with superpower China – an ongoing conflict which requires a more modernized Navy and array of equipment. “In light of the situations in the South China Sea, this is a very timely cooperation that will enable the decision makers of the Philippine government here in Manila to grasp in real time the situation off shore,” said Kazuhiko. Early this week, China has blocked and fired a water cannon on small Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea. – Rappler.com 1 Japanese yen = 0.39 Philippine peso",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines on Thursday, January 16, expressed its “serious concern” over the incursions of China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, including the so-called “monster ship,” in the Philippines’ maritime zones during a Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM) in Xiamen, China. “The Philippines expressed serious concern regarding recent incidents in the South China Sea, particularly the activities of CCG 5901 and CCG 3103 in Philippine maritime zones that are inconsistent with the 1982 UNCLOS and the Philippine Maritime Zones Act,” the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a release to the media. Since early January, China has been sending vessels, including the massive CCG 5901, to an area just 60 to 90 nautical miles away from the coast of Zambales. The Philippine Coast Guard has been challenging the CCG ship, as it remains sailing in those waters. The National Security Council’s Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya has called on China to withdraw their ships. The DFA said the two countries also “exchanged views” on a “provisional understanding” aimed to avoid tensions and confrontations during resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal, where the BRP Sierra Madre serves as a military outpost for the Philippines. The two countries “acknowledged its positive outcomes, and agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions,” said the DFA. Without going into details, China and the Philippines “agreed to reinvigorate the platform for coast guard cooperation” — a proposal that was first brought up in July 2024, in the aftermath of a tense June 17, 2024 confrontation between the CCG and elite Philippine soldiers in Ayungin or Second Thomas Shoal. “The two sides also identified ocean meteorology as an area of focus for a workshop on marine scientific cooperation,” said the DFA. DFA Undersecretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, who led the Philippine contingent, said the Philippines was willing to “engage in dialogue” even as its “position is clear and consistent.” “We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,” she said in her opening remarks. This is the 10th iteration of the BCM, which started in 2017 under former president Rodrigo Duterte. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio has raised concerns that licensed Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) catering to the mainland Chinese market are merely being used as fronts for illegal activities. According to Carpio, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation’s (PAGCOR) should not have issued any licenses to POGOs operated by China, given that gambling is banned in China. Access to websites of POGOs claiming to cater to the mainland Chinese market would have also been blocked by China’s “Great Firewall,” the country’s powerful censorship machinery. “Have you heard about the ‘great firewall of China?’ The online POGOs claiming to operate in China are blocked. They get license from PAGCOR saying they operate in China but they are blocked,” Carpio said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay media forum on Saturday, July 20. The former SC justice alleged that Chinese-run POGOs are using the license as “cover only so they can have buildings, operation with computers.” He said that the firms might instead be engaged in scamming and internet phishing. Carpio said he hoped President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. would speak up against POGOs in his upcoming 3rd State of the Nation Address. “It is probably good if he can announce he is against the rules of PAGCOR issuing licenses on POGO that cater to the mainland Chinese market,” Carpio said on Saturday. “Just cancel those licenses. We are just fooling ourselves,” he added. Carpio, along with former senator Leila de Lima and former SC justice Conchita Carpio Morales, had previously urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to cancel the licenses granted to POGOs. “PAGCOR cannot, and should not, issue a license to any POGO that caters to the mainland Chinese market. Any such license is void ab initio under PAGCOR’s own regulations,” their open letter read. POGOs first began expanding in the Philippines in 2016 under the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, which took a liberal stance in regulating the industry. Although China has repeatedly asked for POGOs in the country to be shut down, the Philippine government has never issued a ban against POGOs, in part due to the economic gains that the POGOs supposedly bring in. However, the tide has begun to turn under the Marcos administration. Officials on Marcos’ economic team have pointed out that the “social costs” of POGOs outweigh their economic benefits. The Alice Guo saga in the Senate and continued raids on illegal POGOs have also fueled further calls from politicians for a complete ban. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday, January 30, that plans to meet with US President Donald Trump over his new immigration policy seen to affect the hundreds of thousands of US-based Filipinos. While replying to a question on Trump’s order to freeze foreign aid, Marcos said in a chance media interview in Cebu: “The US has frozen aid but I will meet with President Trump because…there is much that we need to discuss between the US and Philippines in terms of trade, in terms of defense and security, and now the new policy on immigration. Nagpauwi na yata ng ilang daan na Filipino (I think hundreds of Filipinos have been sent home).” “This is something that we have to work through and hopefully resolve because Filipinos in the US especially have formed a very important part of their workforce,” he added. Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez earlier reported that 24 Filipinos had been recently deported and 80 more were up for deportation. However, these were cases that were tried from the Biden administration. “We’ll see how we can influence the policymaking in terms of immigration,” Marcos said. Marcos added that he also plans to bring up the new administration’s plans to freeze aid, and what it means for the Philippines, as well as trade and defense and security matters. No date was mentioned for the planned meeting. The Philippines and the United States are treaty allies. After Trump was inaugurated on January 20, the White House boasted the first of its deportation flights on social media. Trump’s mass deportation plan, which was a highlight of his campaign, sent fears through the Filipino-American community — as even some documented immigrants felt uncertain about the future. There are more than 4 million individuals living in the US who are Filipino nationals or of Filipino descent. Romualdez earlier estimated some 350,000 Filipinos staying in the country illegally. He had advised undocumented Filipinos to voluntarily return to the Philippines instead of risk deportation. Migrante USA, a human rights organization of Filipino migrants in the USA, said on Thursday that it had received reports of arrests by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and detention of at least eight Filipino workers in the Chicago suburbs, including caregivers. “We demand the Philippine government to live up to its mandate and respond. This advice of Romualdez and [Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo] de Vega to undocumented Filipinos to just accept the situation and keep quiet is irresponsible and dangerous,” Migrante USA said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines –The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) said its single confinement policy (SPC) has already been scrapped. PhilHealth Executive Vice President Eli Santos told senators on Wednesday, October 2, that the policy shift took effect on October 1 even though the circular has yet to be published publicly. “This will take effect October 1, 2024, Mr. Chairperson, and the policy will be published on October 7, 2024. This will have a retroactive effect effective October 1, 2024,” Santos told the Senate joint committees on health and demography and finance. The “single period of confinement (SPC) rule” provided that beneficiaries who are confined due to an illness can only be covered by PhilHealth once within a 90-day period. This leaves patients to fend for themselves in case they get readmitted for the same illness. PhilHealth corporate affairs vice president Rey Baleña said those who will pay for the cost of a readmission from October 1 to 6 are entitled to reimbursements. This applies to public and private health facilities. “Readmissions starting October 1 this year will be covered by this lifting of the SPC rule,” Baleña told Rappler in a text message. “At any rate, we will not deny claims affected. Paglabas ng circular (When the circular is released) and the system for this, all affected claims will be paid accordingly.” He added that the state health insurer already called for an emergency meeting with the country’s hospital groups to inform them of the policy change ahead of time. PhilHealth’s benefits committee (BenCom) had recommended on September 24 to scrap the policy. The recommendation was then adopted by the state insurer’s board of directors on September 27. “We complied with our promise to lift the rule on single period of confinement,” Santos said. Data from the DOH show that the controversial policy led to the denial of 26,750 claims in 2023. Most of the cases for readmission included community acquired pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and chronic kidney disease, among other illnesses. To be again covered by PhilHealth, some patients were advised to change their diagnosis or reason for hospital admission. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos said that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will likely “grant the wish” of LGBT Pilipinas, a group that backed his 2022 run, to create an “advisory body or commission” for LGBTQIA+ affairs. Araneta-Marcos hosted the group at the Palace Heroes’ Hall to celebrate Pride on Thursday eveningm June 29, and witnessed the oath-taking of the new set of officers of LGBT Pilipinas, according to Malacañang. A Malacañang press statement said that LGBT Pilipinas wants “more visibility and representation in the bureaucracy” through the proposed advisory body or commission, which would be under the Office of the President. In the Philippines, explicit protections for those who identify as LGBTQIA+ is mostly piecemeal and local, through ordinances. An anti-SOGIE discrimination bill, in different forms, has been pending before Congress for over two decades. LGBT Pilipinas is lobbying for the creation of the advisory body through the First Lady, said Malacañang. “Knowing my husband, I’m sure he will grant the wish because he knows that you all campaigned for him and he wouldn’t be there without you guys. So, thank you very much. I think it’s our way of giving back to those who helped him in the election,” the Palace statement quoted her as saying. LGBT Pilipinas mobilized and campaigned for both Marcos and Duterte during the 2022 polls. It was during an LGBT Pilipinas even where Duterte opened up about her own discovery of gender expression, telling members back in March 2022 that she “sometimes wants to be a man and sometimes wants to be a woman.” While the group, which claims a 120,000-strong membership around the country, endorsed Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, progressive LGBTQ+ organizations did not. The group also supported former president Rodrigo Duterte, who had falsely claimed that being gay was a disease, and even as he used queerness as a punchline in his rambling speeches. Neither Marcos nor Sara made clear their stands on queer rights during the campaign. Sara once expressed support for a SOGIE equality bill but said transgender women should undergo “sexual reassignment” before using women’s restrooms. A SOGIE anti-discrimination bill, or legislation that would bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, is not a Marcos priority bill. Yet Marcos said during the Pride event at Malacañang that his administration wanted equality for all and protecting against discrimination based on one’s “orientation.” “We in the Philippines ay ang habol lang naman talaga natin (what we really want) is that everybody is treated not for any other thing, not for race, not for creed, not for orientation, but just as Filipinos. And that this government, that’s what it’s trying to do,” he said, while conceding that his wife was “better briefed” on legal issues that impact the queer community. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – As China continues its incursions in the West Philippine Sea, the Philippines said that it was crafting guidelines on the conduct of maritime activities in the waterway, including joint patrols with the country’s allies. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) confirmed the development on Thursday, March 2, after senior officials from the United States, Japan, and Australia had held meetings with Philippine officials in recent weeks. “GPH (Government of the Philippines) is in the process of crafting guidelines for the conduct of combined maritime activities in the WPS, including joint patrols,” the DFA said in a statement. It added that the Philippines and US would discuss “operational details, including on the possibility of engaging other regional partners” as part of the two country’s security cooperation. No other details were offered as of posting. The DFA’s statements comes after officials from the US, Japan, and Australia separately tackled the possibility of conducting joint patrols with the Philippines as part of efforts to address China’s growing aggression in the South China Sea. The Philippines had previously suspended joint patrols with the US in October 2016 under orders from former president Rodrigo Duterte. In February 2023, Manila and Washington confirmed that the two countries had agreed to restart joint patrols, after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III made his first trip to the Philippines under the Marcos administration. Since then, officials from both countries have said that advanced talks were underway on the issue. Japan, meanwhile, earlier said that it was exploring the possibility of cooperating with partners to reinforce maritime domain awareness and maritime law enforcement activities in the region. Meanwhile, in a visit to the Philippines last February 22, Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles likewise confirmed that it was in talks for the conduct joint patrols in the South China Sea. “We will continue that work and we hope that that comes to fruition soon,” Marles said. In an effort to shore up it presence and defense in the West Philippines Sea, the Marcos administration has sought to expand security ties with the Philippine regional partners, while focusing international attention on the dispute. In 2016, the Philippines won a landmark legal award asserting its rights in the West Philippine Sea. China though has continued to ignore the ruling, which it considered “invalid.” The 2016 Hague ruling struck down China’s expansive claims, actions, and nine-dash-line in the South China Sea as illegal. – Rappler.com",

Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles confirmed Bersamin’s appointment on Tuesday, September 27, saying Bersamin had taken his oath before Marcos earlier in the day prior to attending the ninth Cabinet meeting. Bersamin, who retired from the SC in October 2019, turns 73 next month. Today we administered the oath of Former Chief Justice Lucas Purugganan Bersamin as the acting Executive Secretary of our administration. https://t.co/wxnRfxhuru Rodriguez served as executive secretary for less than three months, making him the shortest serving executive secretary in recent years. Rodriguez is now Marcos’ chief of staff. Before Malacañang confirmed Rodriguez’ resignation, word was going around that the President was looking for a new executive secretary, and that a former Supreme Court justice was among those being eyed. Bersamin’s 10-year stint in the High Court had been marked by controversial ponencias and concurring votes, including the acquittal of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the bail grant to plunder defendant Juan Ponce Enrile, now Marcos’ chief legal adviser. Bersamin’s bail grant favoring Enrile, in particular, had been based on humanitarian considerations because of old age and was later cited by the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan in keeping Imelda Marcos free despite conviction for seven counts of graft. He was also one of the nine Supreme Court justices who voted to allow a hero’s burial for the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos in 2016. Before leaving the SC, Bersamin said he wanted to be remembered as a “healing chief justice,” a reference to the controversial quo warranto case against former chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno that had rocked the judiciary. (READ: Chief Justice Bersamin’s philosophy: Restraint in favor of government) Appointed to the Court by Arroyo in 2009, Bersamin came from the Court of Appeals, and before that, was a judge at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC).

Peasants and government officials across the country watched the event from their provinces. But this is just one promise fulfilled. Filipino farmers are beset by a myriad of problems that have spanned decades of struggle. Raul Montemayor, national manager of the Federation of Free Farmers Cooperatives, took the law as a good sign that the government is genuine in helping farmers. However, there are more lands that need to be distributed. “Napakalaki pa ‘yung lupa na dapat sakop ng agrarian reform na hindi pa nauumpisahan,” said Montemayor in a radio interview on Friday. (There are still vast tracts of lands that are yet to be distributed under agrarian reform.) Since the implementation of the CARP three decades ago, the government has distributed by 2020 more than 4.9 million hectares, or 91% of the total land promised. Aside from incomplete land distribution, enhancing land productivity remains a roadblock in making agrarian reform felt by peasants. The Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura said that as much as they welcome this new development, amortization is only one of the problems that the sector faces. “A heavier burden on farmers was the lack of support for making land granted to them productive, such as production subsidies, mechanized farm tools, irrigation services, and more,” the group said in a statement. Even the President acknowledges the problem of productivity and promises to provide more support to farmers. Now that loans are condoned, Montemayor said it would be easier for developers to buy and eventually convert the land for non-agricultural uses. “Actually ‘yun ang isang babantayan natin dahil mako-condone ‘yung utang, mapapadali ‘yung pagpapatitulo,” said Montemayor. (That’s one of the things that we need to look out for. If debt is condoned, giving away titles would be expedited.) Once condoned, the farmers would be free from encumbrance which hinders them in the first place from selling their land. “Baka mas malaki ngayon ‘yung pagkakataon sa mga developer na bilhin ngayon iyang mga lupang ‘yan at i-convert sa ibang non-agricultural use,” he added. (There will be a bigger chance for developers to buy the land and utilize it for non-agricultural use.) Developing agricultural lands for commercial use is one of the ways landlords had evaded land redistribution in the past. The principal loans valued at P14.5 billion of the 263,622 beneficiaries were already condoned outright. The remaining P43.06 billion in loans of 346,432 beneficiaries will be condoned when the Landbank and the Department of Agrarian Reform submit details to Congress. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – The grocery shelves that used to display soft drinks are empty, and small neighborhood stores in Cagayan de Oro are selling these popular non-alcoholic beverages at prices twice as much as they did in July. The shortage in the supply of the fast-selling soft drinks is hurting sari-sari stores in the city and other areas, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) officials said on Monday, October 3. DTI-Misamis Oriental director Almer Masillones said the shortage adversely affected small store owners more than groceries and fast food outlets. “Sari-sari store owners are already complaining about the shortage, and wondering where they can get their supplies,” Masillones said. He said the situation has worried government regulators because soft drinks, while not basic commodities, are considered essential to the business of small neighborhood store owners. The soft drink scarcity came even as the Philippines projected a sugar production of 2.03 million metric tons in 2022, which is short by 200,000 MT. Major beverage companies Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and ARC Refreshments Corporation have confirmed a shortage in premium-refined sugar, an important ingredient in their beverage products. In August, Coca-Cola Philippines was forced to suspend operations in some of its key manufacturing plants in the country because of the shortage of sugar. Lawyer Ruth Sybil Salvador, the local DTI mediation officer, said the situation resulted in the hoarding of soft drinks, especially the popular beverage products of Coca-Cola. Salvador said the local DTI office has already received complaints from store owners about the soft drink hoarding in some warehouses. Officials were also informed that the shortage pushed the retail prices of soft drinks by as much as 100% in Cagayan de Oro. In one subdivision in uptown Cagayan de Oro, a 1.5-liter Coke is now being sold for more than P100. “A small bottle of soft drink is more expensive than the price of a liter of gasoline or diesel,” complained Menzie Montes, a reporter from Radio Mindanao Network’s I-FM in Cagayan de Oro. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "COTABATO CITY, Philippines – Of the over 900 generals and colonels in the Philippine National Police, only 10 did not heed the call of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos to submit their courtesy resignation to jumpstart the cleansing process in the PNP. Abalos said in Cotabato City on Monday, January 23, that 10 of the PNP’s highest-ranking officials have not tendered their courtesy resignations. “Some are retiring,” said Abalos, who visited the city for the 4th founding anniversary celebration of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). He did not elaborate but said that he was thankful that the majority of the PNP generals and colonels cooperated to make it easier for the Marcos administration to purge the police organization. In early January, Abalos called on police generals and colonels to submit their courtesy resignation as part of efforts to purge the PNP of erring cops, especially those with drug links. In the BARMM alone, two generals, including PNP regional director Brigadier General John Guyguyon, and 13 colonels tendered their courtesy resignation days after Abalos made the call. Last week, PNP chief General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. said more than 97% of the country’s 953 generals and colonels heeded Abalos’ call. He said two generals and five colonels who have not submitted their resignation letters would retire before the 2nd quarter. The PNP said all those who volunteered to resign would be assessed by a five-person committee led by Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong, a retired police general. The committee’s recommendations would then be reviewed by the National Police Commission (Napolcom), and submitted to President Marcos Jr. who may accept or reject the resignations. In Cotabato, Abalos called on Bangsamoro officials to help the Marcos administration crack down on illegal drugs and to ensure that prison facilities in the region are drug-free. “You must give them a drug-free environment. It’s about correction. It’s about rehabilitation. If drugs are sneaked into these facilities, then our campaign is useless,” he said. Abalos also ordered the BARMM police to carry out the anti-drug campaign and expand its coverage to 63 villages in Cotabato province that are now part of the Bangsamoro’s political territory. While Cotabato province is part of Soccsksargen, 63 of its villages voted to become BARMM’s special geographic areas, a setup that has resulted in confusion and overlapping of functions between the PNP-Soccksargen and PNP-BARMM. Abalos said it was already agreed that the 63 special geographic areas in Cotabato province would be the responsibility of PNP-BARMM. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Sunday, May 26, warned that China will be going against international law if it pushes through with its newest coast guard regulation. In a statement, DFA expressed “serious concern” about the new regulation that would enable the Chinese Coast Guard to apprehend people it deemed “trespassers” in its waters, especially in the context of rising tensions between China and the Philippines. The regulation was announced on May 15, 2024 and is expected to take effect on June 15, 2024. “China would be in direct violation of international law should it enforce these new regulations in the waters and maritime features within the illegal, null and void, and expansive 10-dash line, which would effectively cover areas of the West Philippine Sea where the Philippines has sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, or in the high seas,” DFA said. While any state has the right to have its own laws, the Philippine government agency reminded China that domestic laws cannot be applied in the “territory, maritime zones, or jurisdictions of other states, nor violate other sovereign states’ rights and entitlements under international law.” “We reiterate our call for China to comply with international law and desist from any action that would undermine peace and security in the region,” it said. China earlier said that the new regulations merely “standardize the administrative law-enforcement procedures of Coast Guard agencies and better uphold order at sea,” and that it is “consistent with universal practices.” Defense Secretary Gibo Teodoro on Friday, May 24, tagged this new move by China as “provocation, adding that its implementation is a “matter of international concern” since it is a “breach of international peace.” The National Security Council (NSC), meanwhile, urged Filipino fisherfolk – who have already been subjected to harassment and intimidation by both Chinese state agents and vessels – to not be afraid of the new regulation. NSC spokesperson Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya earlier said Filipino fisherfolk can continue fishing in the West Philippine Sea as they are “backed by the law and your government.” – Rappler.com",

This was contained in the March 24 situation report by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which was sent to the media on Saturday, March 25. The PCG follows the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCOP), which details the tiered response to oil spill situations at various levels: As of Friday, March 24, 17 cities and municipalities have been affected by the oil spill. Environment Secretary Ma. Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga had warned that the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro threatens marine ecology not only of the Philippines but the world. According to the latest situation report, the following environmental effects were observed during a biodiversity rapid assessment from March 6 to 10: Meanwhile, in a press conference on Thursday, March 23, Oriental Mindoro Governor Humerlito “Bonz” Dolor and an insurance representative announced that victims of the oil spill could start the process of filing for compensation arising from economic losses. The Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) moved to stop the operations of RDC Reield Marine Services, the company that owns MT Princess Empress – the sunken vessel responsible for the oil spill. The closure orders are in effect until authorities finish their investigation into the embattled company. RDC has been in hot water amid questions surrounding the authority of MT Princess Empress to operate. MARINA said the oil tanker, which sank off the coast of Oriental Mindoro with 800,000 liters of bunker fuel in early March, had no updated permit because the company has yet to amend its original certificate of public convenience (CPC). A CPC is a license issued by MARINA to domestic ship operators to engage in domestic shipping activities – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Department of Social Welfare and Development Secretary (DSWD) Secretary Erwin Tulfo was absent on Tuesday, December 20, from the 13th Cabinet meeting of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the last for 2022. Tulfo, who was bypassed for a second time by the Commission on Appointments (CA) last December 14 , told Rappler in a text message he was “on leave” and that an undersecretary attended the meeting in his place. “I am on leave. I informed President Marcos. Undersecretary [Adonis] Sulit was there,” Tulfo said, without stating the reason for his leave. For Marcos’ 13th cabinet meeting, new Palace briefer Daphne Oseña-Paez, said department heads presented the key accomplishments of their respective agencies from July to December, and their programs for 2023. “In the Cabinet meeting earlier, only 11 were able to present their accomplishments because there was not enough time,” Oseña-Paez said in a mix of Filipino and English. “Those who were not able to present will do so during the next Cabinet meeting in January,” she added. The DSWD was not among those which presented during the Tuesday Cabinet meeting. The DSWD secretary was scheduled to appear at a services caravan event in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, on Wednesday December 21. Tulfo did not comment when asked by Rappler if he had already discussed his reappointment with Marcos.Ad-interim secretaries can only be reappointed two times if they are bypassed by the CA. Afterwards, Marcos would have to appoint a new secretary to fill the vacant position. CA members bypassed Tulfo because of his citizenship issues and a libel conviction that was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2008, Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri told reporters last December 12.Tulfo, a well-known former broadcaster, previously said he renounced his US citizenship prior to his appointment in 2022. Zubiri said that they would confer legal experts – and possibly the Supreme Court – on Tulfo’s libel conviction. “There are implications, the CA has never confirmed anyone with final conviction,” Zubiri said in Filipino then. “We have to study first the legal implications. It’s moral turpitude, there has been precedence in the SC. There are decided cases.” Zubiri, who heads the CA, said they would take up Tulfo’s appointment in the first CA hearing in early 2023. At the November 22 CA hearing, Tulfo asked for an executive session to discuss his citizenship and libel conviction issues with the lawmakers. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Sunday, April 2, welcomed the European Commission’s (EC) decision to continue recognizing certificates issued by his country for Filipino seafarers, saying it averted job losses for roughly 50,000 sailors. The EC had warned in 2021 it would withdraw its recognition of Filipino seafarers’ certificates unless serious measures were taken, including compliance with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for seafarers. The Philippines, among the world’s biggest suppliers of maritime labor, has since made serious efforts to comply with the requirements, particularly in key areas like the monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of training and assessment, the EC announced on Friday, March 31. Marcos had met with EC President Ursula von der Leyen in December, when he attended the ASEAN-EU summit in Brussels, to discuss the 15-year-old issue involving Filipino seafarers. In a statement, he said his administration will do everything to address all other issues faced by the local maritime industry so that the Philippines can produce more world-class seafarers. The EC said it intends to provide the Philippines with technical assistance to further improve its education, training and certification system for seafarers. The seafarers are among millions of overseas Filipinos sending home more than $2.5 billion of their earnings each month, boosting consumer spending that drives growth of the domestic economy. – Rappler.com",

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Fisherfolk, led by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council (FARMC) in Rizal, filed a complaint before the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) on Wednesday, January 10, asking for the suspension of reclamation activities in Laguna Lake. Joining the fisherfolk during the protest outside LLDA’s national office were groups Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, Sanlakas Rizal, and the Alliance of Unified People’s Organization in Lupang Arenda (APOLA). Fisherfolk are on the losing end if reclamation activities for the development projects in Laguna Lake continue, said Sonny San Jose, chairperson of Rizal FARMC, in a statement. “Sa pagliit ng espasyo na puwede naming pangisdaan, lumiliit din ang aming kabuhayan,” San Jose said. (As the space where we can fish diminishes, our livelihood is curtailed.) Signing the complaint alongside San Jose were members of FARMC in Tanay, Taytay, Angono, Binangonan, Morong, Baras, Jala-Jala, and Pililia. Vicente Barlos, president of APOLA, and Jose Tagle, president of Federation Binangonan, were also signatories. In the complaint, they urged the LLDA to order a suspension of activities pending investigation, and to start the rehabilitation of affected areas. The LLDA can receive complaints as a quasi-judicial agency. The body could issue a decision and/or take official action after its investigation. Decisions released by quasi-judicial agencies are usually brought to courts. Barlos told Rappler in a phone interview that a staff from the LLDA met with them when they filed the complaint and said the office promised to hold a dialogue with them after a week. Barlos said the LLDA clarified that what’s happening in the area was not reclamation but land recovery. “Sa totoo, kaliwa’t kanan ang ginagawa nilang reclamation,” said Barlos. (In truth, they’re doing reclamation left and right.) Among the projects slated in the area are large-scale ones, including the government’s Laguna Lakeshore Road Network and San Miguel Corporation’s Southeast Metro Manila Expressway. Laguna Lake is the largest inland lake in the country, connected to Manila Bay through the Pasig River. It is surrounded by Metro Manila and the provinces of Rizal and Laguna. The complainants said they conducted a fluvial inspection of Laguna Lake in November 2023 and observed reclamation activities in Taytay, Angono, and Binangonan. According to them, no consultations were conducted with residents and other affected sectors about the nature and purpose of the projects. They have since tried to seek clarifications from concerned agencies such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Philippine Reclamation Authority, to no avail. Thus, they said, they were invoking the authority of the LLDA to investigate the matter. “[This] complaint is the next step in our search for answers and solutions,” the document read. Under the law, the LLDA is tasked to protect the lake and regulate development and livelihood activities. The body can “pass upon and approve or disapprove” proposed projects from the government and private sector. – Rappler.com",

The DTI in Bicol ordered strict enforcement of the price freeze as the threat of a major eruption by Mayon Volcano sent more than 4,000 families or 15,658 persons to evacuation camps in five towns and three cities. A price freeze accompanies the declaration of a state of calamity, which Albay’s provincial board approved on June 9, a day after after Mayon Volcano’s status was raised to Alert Level 3. The DTI also issued a guide on what goods are considered basic commodities. Two days after the Sangguaniang Panlalawigan of Albay approved Resolution No. 0607-2023OIC, DTI regional director Dindo Galvo Nabol said Albay’s supply of basic commodities are sufficient for the next 30 days. Nabol also issued the memorandum circular on the price freeze on June 9, addressing all wet markets, supermarkets, groceries, bakeries, and water refilling stations. “When a state of calamity is declared in a particular area, prices of basic necessities (BN) are automatically frozen at their prevailing prices for sixty (60) days or until sooner lifted,” Nabol reminded business owners. Violators of the price freeze could face fines from P5,000 to PhP1 million and or imprisonment of one year to ten years. Farmers in Tabaco City, Albay scrambled over the weekend to harvest their crops within the six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone (PDZ) of the volcano. Tabaco City Mayor Krisel Lagman-Luistro gave farmers the harvest green to allow them to gather food stock or generate income before a potentially deadly eruption.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The use of trans fat in prepackaged processed food products is now banned in the country starting Monday, June 19. Based on the orders issued by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021, processed food products containing trans fatty acids are prohibited from being manufactured, imported, and distributed for commercial sale after June 18. The FDA said that all product formulations and labels of prepackaged processed food containing trans fat must be fully compliant with their guidelines. This policy was implemented to address the high consumption of trans fat, which increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease and other diseases. Foods like margarine, coffee creamer, and baked goods such as donuts and cookies are typically rich in industrial trans fat, according to the World Health Organization. “Trans fats are the source of our problem for noncommunicable diseases: hypertension, obesity, stroke. Many countries have already banned it, so it’s our turn,” DOH Secretary Ted Herbosa said. According to the DOH, about 3,000 Filipinos suffer yearly from premature mortality related to the high consumption of trans fat. On Monday, health advocates from different sectors launched Bantay Kontra Trans Fat as an initiative to make sure that food manufacturers will comply with the DOH and FDA’s programs to eliminate trans fat. “We have to remain vigilant, empower consumers, and foster compliance,” said Sophia San Luis of public interest group ImagineLaw. She said they will conduct a nationwide literacy campaign in reading packages and labels of food products and educate consumers on the dangers of other sources of trans fats. To report possible noncompliance of food manufacturers to the DOH and FDA orders, San Luis said the public may message the Trans Fat Free Philippines’ Facebook page. Violation of any of the provisions of the administrative order and the FDA circular would be grounds for the disapproval, suspension, or cancelation of the certificate of product registration of concerned food manufacturers. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – The shadow of filariasis has fallen once again on South Cotabato following the confirmation of a case in Koronadal. Six years ago, the province was declared free of the disease, but now, public health workers are fighting to prevent an outbreak from taking hold in the Soccsksargen region, as the specter of this debilitating and disfiguring disease looms once again. The province had been declared filariasis-free by the Department of Health (DOH) in November 2017, after a near-zero prevalence of the disease was recorded over a five-year period. Jose Baroquillo, coordinator for mosquito-borne diseases of South Cotabato’s Integrated Provincial Health Office, confirmed that one out of 38 people tested in Sitio El Nalam, Barangay Assumption, Koronadal City, was found positive for filariasis on January 21. The infected person has been isolated and the infection is still at an early stage, which means it is still curable. To prevent the spread of the disease, health workers have launched a mass blood-testing program and will spray-fog houses in the affected area. Councilor Ester Catorce, who initiated the health outreach program, said the team will also inform residents about the disease and how to prevent its spread. In 2021, 33 cases of filariasis were detected in the villages of Maan and Mongocayo in T’boli town, but were immediately treated. Baroquillo, however, said the detected cases since 2021 did not affect the province’s filariasis-free status, and its prevalence rate has remained below 1% of the population. He also said those who tested positive for the disease, including the recent case, did not show symptoms. Filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is caused by parasitic worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi or B. timori, which are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through large-scale treatment (called mass drug administration) delivered as an annual dose of medicines to all at-risk individuals in an endemic area https://t.co/i7LDEFOsg9 The worms develop into adult worms in the lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage and swelling. The disease can lead to permanent disability or disfigurement, and is treated with preventive chemotherapy. While one case of filariasis may not necessarily indicate a widespread outbreak, health workers normally investigate and determine if there are other cases, or if the individual may have acquired the infection in a community or area where transmission is ongoing. Such measures help determine if public health interventions such as vector control, treatment, and education are needed to prevent further transmission. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The camp of Laban ng Masa chairperson Walden Bello has urged Justice Secretary Crispin Remulla to “exercise independence” in relation to the former vice presidential candidate’s cyber libel case. Luke Espiritu, one of Bello’s legal counsels, made the call during a press conference on Wednesday, August 10. “I really encourage Secretary Remulla to exercise the independence that is incumbent upon his office. Because siya ang (he is) secretary ng mismong (of the actual) justice department, which is obligated to defend justice without fear or favor at least [at] the prosecutorial level,” Espiritu said. On Monday, August 8, Bello was arrested over a cyber libel complaint filed by former Davao City information officer Jefry Tupas. He was released the following day after posting bail. He was indicted in July, prompting his camp to immediately file for a motion for reconsideration before the Davao prosecutor’s office, but it was denied. The Bello camp then sought the DOJ’s intervention by filing a petition before the justice department to review his libel and cyber libel cases on July 29, or prior to Bello’s arrest. During the newsbriefing, Espiritu also reminded the justice department of the power it holds in protecting “freedom.” “We must understand na itong laban na ito (that this fight) involves nothing less than our democracy, our right to free speech, and our freedom of expression,” Espiritu said. “And it should be the institution of our government that has the responsibility to protect this cherished freedom enshrined in our constitution. Therefore, Secretary Remulla, ang bola po ay nasa inyo, dalawa po ang choices ninyo: Hahayaan na lang ba natin na ang ating demokrasya, ang ating kalayaan sa pamamahayag ay babalahurain?” he added. (The ball is in your hands, you have two choices: Should we allow our democracy, our freedom of expression to be trampled upon?) Here is a summary of the points raised by the Bello camp in their petition filed before the justice department on July 29: While waiting for the DOJ’s decision on the appeal, Bello’s camp will also seek another legal action – a motion to suspend proceedings before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) 10 in Davao. The Bello camp said they will file the motion once the documents on Bello’s warrant and bail have returned to the court. The court has yet to announce the schedule of arraignment and pre-trial of the case. – Rappler.com",

I came to that conclusion…in consultation with DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources). They said damage is highly localized,” said Marcos during a short Q&A on the sidelines of a visit to the storm-hit town of Noveleta in Cavite, south of Metro Manila. Marcos visited Cavite, among the provinces most affected by Paeng. Aside from Calabarzon or the upper half of the Southern Tagalog region, Western Visayas and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) sustained the most damage and casualties. “I think we will focus better if we stay with the calamities status as we have now,” the President added, referring to existing proclamations. Placing an area under a state of calamity allows government – local government units, in the case of provinces, towns, and cities – access to funds reserved for disaster relief. The declaration would also freeze the prices of basic commodities. Noveleta is the first and so far only town Marcos has visited in the aftermath of Paeng’s onslaught. His visit to Noveleta was preceded by an aerial inspection over Cavite, where Governor Jonvic Remulla said 18,000 families were evacuated. The NDRRMC had earlier recommended that a national state of calamity be declared since most of the country’s regions experienced “the effects, damage and projected impacts” of Paeng. The Speaker of the House, Martin Romualdez had said he was amenable to the NDRRMC proposal, pending an assessment to be reported by congressmen and congresswomen from affected district, but one of the House leaders from Iloilo warned against a nationwide state of calamity declaration. As of posting, close to 100 people have died because of Severe Tropical Storm Paeng. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has allowed adults aged 50 and above, and those with comorbidities, aged 18 to 49, to get their second COVID-19 booster shot. In a statement on Tuesday, July 26, the DOH said that the move is based on the recommendations of the Health Technology Assessment Council to the agency. It added that only Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be used for them, and will be given fourth months after their first booster or third dose of the vaccine. “As vaccine immunity wanes over time, we are dedicated to helping our people remain protected against COVID-19. We are making it easier for as many of our people to avail of the primary series and boosters – including second boosters,” DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said. The DOH said that eligible individuals can check the schedule of vaccine deployment with their local government units and private service providers. “As part of the preparation for the administration of second booster doses to the above-mentioned populations, orientations for local government units and vaccination centers are already scheduled,” the DOH said. Prior to this development, the second booster shot was only limited to healthcare workers, senior citizens, and immunocompromised individuals with specific medical conditions. The DOH said that eligible individuals need to bring their vaccination card and a valid ID. “A medical certificate is not required, even for those with comorbidities. The medical screener or doctor at the vaccination site is authorized to assess and make the determination,” the agency added. The DOH decided to administer a second booster shot to the age groups as the country deals with a new surge in cases driven by Omicron offshoots. “The DOH, along with other government agencies and private sector partners, aims to increase vaccine coverage nationwide. We need every eligible Juan and Juana to turn this into a whole-of-society fight against the virus,” Vergeire said. The government is targeting to administer booster shots to 50% of the eligible fully vaccinated individuals during the first 100 days of the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., or to 23 million people.

    "article_body": "BATANGAS, Philippines – Oil sludge from the capsized MT Princess Empress has reached the shores of Pola and Pinamalayan in Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Southern Tagalog said on Thursday, March 2. Even worse though, the vessel’s industrial oil cargo has also started to leak into waters off Naujan town, Mindoro Oriental, the PCG said. The announcement raised fears among fisher groups and environmentalists of long-term damage to the lush maritime environment around Mindoro island. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) warned of threats to 21 protected areas. At risk is the Verde Island Passage, a center of marine biodiversity, that links Mindoro to Batangas. “Nakaabot na kaninang umaga ang oil spill sa dalampasigan ng dalawang karatig bayan ng Pola at Pinamalayan (This morning the oil spill has reached the shores of nearby towns Pola and Pinamalayan),” Coast Guard Commodore Innocencio Rosario Jr., Southern Tagalog commander, told Rappler. “We presume it is industrial fuel oil with its appearance of black sticky and strong odor.” UPDATE: The @coastguardph has observed OIL SPILL STRANDING along the shoreline of Barangay Buhay na Tubig in Pola, Oriental Mindoro, today, 02 March 2023. pic.twitter.com/wcW7PEZ2ZN “Our troops from our (PCG) district stations here in Mindoro have documented the oil spill,” Rosario added. He said the BRP Melchora Aquino, a PCG Vessel, deployed it’s Rigid Hull, MTUG Titan, to start the mechanical recovery of spilt oil in the vicinity waters off the submerged motor tanker for further assessment. UPDATE: Kinumpirma ng @coastguardph na may halo na ring INDUSTRIAL FUEL OIL ang oil spill sa katubigan ng Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, ngayong araw, ika-02 ng Marso 2023. KARAGDAGANG DETALYE: https://t.co/XnYWKl8wUt#DOTrPH 🇵🇭#CoastGuardPH #MaritimeSectorWorks pic.twitter.com/AHgT7kPKF1 The PCG in Southern Tagalog has sent an augmentation request of forces from central headquarters, especially the Coast Guard Auxillary (Reserve). “I already sent a request letter to the national headquarters for some forces from Coast Guard Auxillary to augment our personnel on anticipation for extensive effect of oil spill on water of Mindoro,” said Rosario. He added that local government units in Oriental Mindoro had been informed of measures being taken to clean the spillage and the possible effects on the environment and livelihood. PCG’s Marine Environment Protection Unit, the DENR’s Environment Protection Management Bureau, and Malayan Towage and Salvage Corporation are coordinating to address the problem and consequences of the sea mishap. The oil from the submerged vessel has spread across a 40-kilometer radius, an area encroaching on 21 protected areas, including a fish sanctuary. Jay Lim of Tanggol Kalikasan, an environmental law group, also told Rappler the oil spill threatens all marine ecology, including coral reefs that serves fish sanctuaries. “Kami ay nangangamba sa masamang kontribusyon ng oil spill sa karagatan na nakakaambag para masira ang mga marine ecology particular ang coral reef na nagsislbing pangitlugan ng mga isda.” Lim said. (We fear that the oil spill is contributing to the damage to the marine ecology, particularly to the coral reefs that serve as fish spawing ground.) – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Audit (COA), which has the mandate to audit the spending of government funds, said it is open to reviewing existing guidelines on the use of confidential and intelligence funds (CIF). “Actually po, maganda po ‘yung inyong mungkahi. Because of the increasing confidential and intelligence funds, we will try to convene po interagency with the same interagency committee na nag-promulgate po nitong rules na ito so para ma-update natin ’cause medyo matagal na rin…2015, that’s 80 years ago,” COA Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba said during the body’s budget hearing in Congress on Thursday, August 24. (Actually, your suggestion is good. Because of the increasing confidential and intelligence funds, we will try to convene with the same interagency committee that promulgated these rules so we can update them already because it’s been a long time. 2015, that’s 80 years ago.) The idea to review the COA guidelines was brought up by Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel when he asked if the COA was willing to revisit the rules governing CIF. By definition, confidential funds are meant to be used for “surveillance activities in civilian government agencies that are intended to support the mandate or operations of the said agency.” Unlike other funds used by the government, CIF are not subject to the same rigorous auditing processes as other government funds. Based on the proposed budget for 2024, the government is asking for P10.14 billion in CIF across government agencies – majority of which will go to the offices of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte. The hike in the budget allotted for CIF started during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s term, apparently maintained by his successor. Cordoba, during the hearing, said they will call for a meeting with other agencies within the third quarter of the year. According to the COA, the grant and liquidation of CIF are covered by Joint Circular No. 2015-01, dated January 8, 2015. The circular includes the COA, the Department of Budget and Management, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of National Defense, and the Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations. The said circular states that intelligence funds can only be used for counter-intelligence activities and special projects and operations. Meanwhile, confidential funds can be used to purchase information necessary in the implementation of a government program, among others. Since the funds are supposedly intended for programs to protect national security, the specific uses of CIF are not disclosed to the public. In reviewing the expenditure of CIF, state auditors rely on the certifications of government agencies, since receipts are not always available for the transactions. – with research from Marjorie delos Reyes/ Rappler.com Marjorie delos Reyes, a Rappler intern, is a Development Communication student at UP Los Baños.

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The El Niño phenomenon has started to weaken and neutral conditions may return in April-May-June 2024, the country’s weather bureau said in a briefing on Thursday, March 7. But there is an “increasing probability” of La Niña developing in June-July-August 2024, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) to raise La Niña Watch also on Thursday. El Niño, La Niña, and neutral are the three phases of El Niño-Southern Oscillation or ENSO, which the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines as “a recurring natural phenomenon characterized by fluctuating ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, coupled with changes in the atmosphere.” The current El Niño episode began in the tropical Pacific in June 2023, gradually progressing from weak to strong. In the Philippines, El Niño has triggered drought in at least 24 areas, a dry spell in 16 areas, and dry conditions in 10 areas as of February 29. The Department of Agriculture estimated on February 25 that El Niño has caused at least P357.4 million worth of damage and losses to farms in the Ilocos Region, Mimaropa, Western Visayas, and Zamboanga Peninsula. According to the WMO, the 2023-2024 El Niño “has peaked as one of the five strongest on record,” though it is weaker than the 1997-1998 and 2015-2016 events. It peaked between November 2023 and January 2024. The WMO had also warned on Tuesday, March 5, that while El Niño is gradually weakening, “it will continue to impact the global climate in the coming months, fueling the heat trapped by greenhouse gases from human activities.” Even as the Philippines and other countries are still dealing with the effects of El Niño, PAGASA explained that the issuance of La Niña Watch is already needed since there is now a 55% chance of La Niña developing in the next six months. La Niña“is characterized by unusually cooler than average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.” It triggers above-normal rainfall in the Philippines. But Ana Liza Solis, officer-in-charge of PAGASA’s Climatology and Agrometeorology Division, noted that the raising of La Niña Watch is not an absolute guarantee that the phenomenon will indeed develop. “It’s still uncertain. Once PAGASA raises La Niña Alert, that’s when confidence would be higher that La Niña will develop. The La Niña Watch [issued now] is asking you to be aware and be prepared,” Solis said in a mix of Filipino and English. The last La Niña was a “triple-dip” event, according to the WMO, as it began in September 2020 and lasted until early 2023, or for three straight years. Aside from the gradually weakening El Niño and the possibility of La Niña, the onset of the country’s warm and dry season is also expected to be announced soon. PAGASA said in Thursday’s briefing that it expects to declare the start of the warm and dry season – which Filipinos often call “summer” – within two weeks. So far, the northeast monsoon or amihan has yet to be terminated. PAGASA reminded the public that soaring temperatures from March to May may pose health risks such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion. The onset of the rainy season after the warm and dry season could also be slightly delayed, partly due to the ongoing El Niño. – Rappler.com",

Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday, that the Ombudsman’s decision will allow NFA to reopen padlocked warehouses needed as supplies of palay supplies are expected to come in. “I instructed the NFA to immediately implement the Ombudsman’s order,” he said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – A Commission on Audit (COA) team has sought sanctions against officials of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) who failed to meet deadlines on submission of the agency’s Financial Statements (FS) in the past three years. State auditors said in a letter posted on November 6, Monday, that the DICT has not heeded annual reminders on meeting the timetable on submitting yearend and quarterly FS, as well as supporting account schedules and subsidiary ledgers. The deadline for yearend FS is February 14 the following year while quarterly FS are supposed to be turned over to the audit team within 10 days from the end of each quarter. These documents are needed to facilitate referencing and monitoring and identifying accountabilities. Auditors said that among the unsubmitted financial reports that should have been part of the FS were the aging of accounts, schedule of income taxes paid, schedule of fund transfer, statement of management responsibility, statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts. The DICT said it was able to submit the 2022 yearend FS on May 2, 2023 but without the Statement of Management Responsibility. Electronic copies of the complete yearend FS for 2021 was submitted to the COA only on June 28, 2022 while the complete hardcopy was handed to the audit team only on May 2, 2023. “The delayed submission of the financial reports and records has been a yearly observation of the AT (audit team). In CYs [Calendar Years] 2020 and 2021, the DICT failed to submit its FS within the prescribed period that necessarily should be supported with complete schedules and SLs (subsidiary ledgers),” the audit team said. “Failure of officials/employees concerned to comply shall cause the automatic suspension of the payment of their salaries and other emoluments until they have complied. Violation of at least three consecutive times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary action,” it added. Auditors recommended that the DICT Legal Services review the records and recommend to the DICT secretary the appropriate action based on Presidential Decree No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, specifically the “suspension of salaries of those officials/employees responsible.” In its comment on the findings, the DICT said it concurs with the audit recommendations. It also told the COA that it has tapped additional manpower for its accounting department to avoid delayed submission of financial reports. The DICT is the “primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing, and administrative entity of the Executive Branch of the government that will plan, develop, and promote the national ICT development agenda.” Among its functions is cybersecurity which includes suppressing cybercrime offenses and cyberattacks on critical infrastructures that affect national security. It is also supposed to provide “pro-active government countermeasures against domestic and transnational incidents affecting the Philippine cyberspace” as well as cybersecurity threats to the country. – Rappler.com",

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine embassy in Israel has recommended that all travel from the Philippines to Israel be postponed indefinitely after Israel declared a “state of war” in response to the attacks by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific offer flights to Dubai, after which travelers take other airlines to Tel Aviv. “We wish to clarify that Philippine Airlines does not operate flights to Tel Aviv. We do not use Israeli airspace for any of our flights,” said PAL spokesperson Cielo Villaluna. “In view of the volatile security situation in Israel, the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv strongly recommends that all travel from the Philippines to Israel be postponed indefinitely, or until such time that the situation has stabilized,” the embassy said in a post on its Facebook account late Sunday, October 15. Travel from the busy Ben Gurion International Airport, also known as Tel Aviv airport, to Manila, however, remains open which means Filipinos in Israel can still leave the country and fly home, the embassy said. “Those with confirmed flights, however, are advised to check with their travel agency for possible flight cancellations,” it added. Hamas has also reportedly targeted the Ben Gurion International Airport, according to CNN, following the group’s surprise attack from Gaza on October 7. People in Tel Aviv have been advised to stay indoors while people in Gaza, southern Israel, where the conflict is raging, have been advised to stay in underground shelters. Thousands of Filipinos fly to Israel, where the Holy Land is located, for travel and leisure purposes. The Israel Ministry of Tourism said in July 2023 that a total of 19,300 Filipino tourists visited their country from January to June 2023. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, Israel hosted 34,000 Filipino tourists. Based on data relased by the Department of Migrant Workers in August 2022, around 23,754 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Israel are employed mostly as caregivers, service sector employees, and hotel workers. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Sunday ordered all government agencies to ensure the safety of OFWs in Israel in response to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Support for amending the 1987 Constitution has dropped significantly over the past year, according to a Pulse Asia Research, Incorporated survey released on Wednesday, March 27. From 41% of Filipino adults supporting charter change efforts in March 2023, there are now only 8% in favor of the move. The pollster, which interviewed 1,200 respondents from March 6 to 10, said 88% of Filipinos are not in favor of amending the Constitution, a 43-percentage point increase from the 45% who opposed the move last year. A big majority or 74% of Filipinos said it “should not be amended now or any other time,” a significant increase from 31% in March 2023. Of the 88% opposed to amending the Constitution, 6% are open to charter change under the Marcos administration, while 8% said they would prefer changes to be made under the next administration. “Sa pamamagitan ng survey na ito ay ipinapakita na halos 90% ng mga Filipino ay ayaw at laban sa charter change,” ACT Teachers Representative France Castro said in a statement. (This survey shows that almost 90% of Filipinos are against charter change.) “Kaya dapat itigil na ang charter change at ituon ng gobyerno ang oras at resources nito sa pressing problems ng mga Filipino.” (That’s why we need to stop charter change now at have the government dedicate its time and resources to the Filipino people’s pressing problems instead.) The survey results were released just a week after Resolution of Both Houses No. 7 (RBH7) was passed by the House of Representatives after weeks of holding marathon hearings. The survey results showed that 67% of the respondents are aware of the current efforts to amend the charter through the people’s initiative, but 93% were not among those who received the public petition. Only 7% were reached by the public initiative, and “most did not affix their signature to the document.” Among the 24% who signed the people’s initiative, respondents were almost split when asked if they received an incentive for signing the petition. Pulse Asia said 45% said they received an incentive for signing the petition, mostly from Class E. One of the allegations surrounding the public initiative is that people were tricked into signing the petition, which was guised as financial assistance from government agencies. Most of the respondents said they were not in favor of the proposed reforms. There were also changes in support for some of the proposed charter amendments compared to the previous year For example, there are now less Filipinos supporting the move to allow foreign individuals and firms to own stakes in mass media and advertising and on calls for term extension for both national and local officials. Support for changing the country’s government system also saw a 20-percentage point drop in support. In March 2023, 38% of Filipinos said they favored the move but the numbers dropped to 18% in 2024. RBH7, the proposal that breezed through the House last week, inserts the phrase “unless otherwise provided by law” in provisions limiting foreign ownership in the public utilities, education, and advertising sectors. It is a resolution copied from the proposals of the Senate, which House lawmakers adopted to expedite the charter change process at the 19th Congress. The ball is now at the Senate, which has had four public hearings on the charter amendments so far. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Amid excessive heat caused by the El Niño phenomenon, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) called on employers to implement flexible working arrangements when possible. “Ang DOLE po ay advocate ng, una, flexible work arrangement, tapos ‘yung tinatawag na work-from-home arrangement (The DOLE is an advocate of flexible work and work-from-home arrangements),” Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said in a press briefing on Friday, April 26. Laguesma was responding to Camarines Sur 2nd District Representative LRay Villafuerte, who had called for the return to the work-from-home setup to protect both public and private sector employees from the heat. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), tagged dangerous temperatures in some areas in the country, reaching as high as over 40 degrees celsius, which may result in heat stroke. In elaborating on the DOLE’s position, Laguesma said that flexible working arrangements help with three things: work-life balance, “enhancement” of an employee’s satisfaction, and productivity. But the labor secretary recognized that not all jobs could be easily done in a flexible or work-from-home arrangement. “Siguro doon sa mga may pangangailangan sa physical presence, higit naming pag-iibayuhin ‘yung assistance ng DOLE – paano ba magkaroon ng working hours, working conditions…. Sana epektibo at saka efficient ang ventilation, insulation, at saka ‘yung personal protective equipment,” he said. (For jobs that require physical presence, the DOLE will enhance its assistance – how to have working hours, [ensure] working conditions…. They should be effective and efficient ventilation and insulation, and also personal protective equipment.) The DOLE issued Labor Advisory No. 8 in 2023, which provides for safety and health measures to prevent and control heat stress in workplaces. These include recommendations to adjust working hours, implement breaks for heat-related rest and recovery, and provide free potable water. Labor Undersecretary Benjo Santos Benavidez said that some workers have “lost their jobs” due to the effects of El Niño. (READ: Extreme heat is hurting the economy) He said that as of April, the DOLE assisted more than 35,000 workers through its emergency employment program, Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD) in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Ilocos Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, and Northern Mindanao. – Rappler.com",

    "date_published": "2023-06-07T09:27:16+00:00",
    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "UTRECHT, The Netherlands – The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) said on Tuesday, June 6, it was still open to the possibility of resuming peace negotiations under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., but on certain conditions. “If we see signs that the President is interested in peace negotiations, the NDF has always said that it is open to peace negotiations, but of course there will have to be some steps before the NDF enters into peace negotiations,” said NDFP negotiating panel interim chair Juliet de Lima, wife of the late Jose Maria Sison, the founding chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). The NDFP is the political wing of the CPP. De Lima said among the conditions would be for the Philippine government to take back the designation of their peace consultants as terrorists under the contested anti-terror law, and the release of political prisoners. “So far I have not read anything from the President of any interest in resuming the peace negotiations, so right now there’s really nothing,” De Lima told Rappler in an interview at the NDF office in Utrecht on Tuesday. The Marcos government has given no sign of interest in resuming peace talks. In March, army chief Lieutenant General Romeo Brawner Jr. said, “Our President has ordered an end to the CPP-NPA – finish them off.” Marcos’ new defense secretary, Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro Jr. told the ABS-CBN News Channel Wednesday, June 7, in Manila that he had “always been against” entering into peace talks. “Well, Marcos is a Marcos, and he’s probably like his father who would depend on the military, who would be still puppet to the US,” said De Lima. Teodoro was the defense secretary under former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who launched an intense counter-insurgency campaign against the Left. One of Arroyo’s top military commanders, Jovito Palparan Jr., is serving sentence at the New Bilibid Prison over the disappearance of student activists Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeno. Luis Jalandoni, NDFP’s senior adviser who is also exiled in the Netherlands, has been designated as a terrorist under the new law passed by former president Rodrigo Duterte during the pandemic. The law has been mostly upheld by the Philippine Supreme Court, with a narrow window of opportunity for future legal challenges when actual cases arise. Jalandoni said that, for his part, there are no legal steps yet to challenge his designation, or the constitutionality of the law’s clause that allows the executive anti-terror council to designate anybody as a terrorist without having to present proof before a court. “There are attempts and campaigns by organizations here in The Netherlands, but also in the USA, Canada, and other countries. They have taken up the campaign, and their main argument is that it goes against the possibilities of resuming the peace talks,” said Jalandoni. Duterte ended peace talks with the communists in 2019 after a promising start when he became president in 2016. Since then, Duterte created the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), which launched intense campaigns that included red-tagging of activists and journalists. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Office of the Ombudsman has affirmed its resolution that recommended the filing of graft charges against officials involved in the Pharmally Pharmaceutical Corporation mess. In an order dated May 3, but was publicized on Thursday, May 9, the Ombudsman denied the supplemental motion for reconsideration filed by former Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) undersecretary Lloyd Christopher Lao. Aside from dismissing the appeal, the Ombudsman also modified its indictment order and included Lin Weixiong. Lin Weixiong is Rose Nono Lin’s husband. He was among the business personalities implicated in the Pharmally mess. The private respondents include Twinkle Dargani, Mohit Dargani, Linconn Ong, Justine Garado, and Huang Tzu Yen. The Ombudsman’s special panel of investigators recommended the filing of charges against Lao, former procurement director and current Overall Deputy Ombudsman Warren Rex Liong, and other PS-DBM and Pharmally officials under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The Ombudsman said the respondents allegedly conspired and acted in bad faith in procuring RT-PCR test kits worth P1.3 billion. Pharmally was among the biggest scandals that happened during the presidency of former president Rodrigo Duterte. A string of anomalies was exposed in connection with the multi-billion-peso COVID-19 contracts awarded by Duterte’s government to Pharmally, a small company with a mere P625,000-capital. An investigative report by Rappler revealed that Chinese businessman Michael Yang, Duterte’s former economic adviser and friend, has links to Pharmally. The company’s officials said Yang was their financier and guarantor, but the former presidential adviser denied the claim. – Rappler.com",

Marcos was referring to his predecessor’s bloody and ruthless “war on drugs” that mostly targeted the poor. For Marcos, the government’s focus should veer less towards law enforcement and focus more on prevention and helping heal those who are already addicted to illegal subtances. “We are trying to learn which are the best methods now to pull our victims – [because] really is what they are – pull them out of that culture and to help them start again and do live a good life as good and contributing members of society,” added Marcos. Months earlier, in July, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos had also said that there would be no letup in the war against drugs. “The war against drugs will be as intensive as before on the basis of my oath as a public official in accordance with the Constitution,” Abalos said then. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Elections (Comelec) sought a P43.7-billion budget for 2024, the year when preparation for the 2025 midterm elections is heaviest, but the executive department trimmed over one-third of its requested funding in its submission to Congress. The National Expenditure Program (NEP) for 2024 released on Wednesday, August 2, indicates that the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is only asking Congress a P27.1-billion budget for the poll body for 2024. In terms of preparations for the midterm polls, the Comelec specifically requested P28.3 billion, but the executive branch only proposed P22.9 billion to the House. The Comelec, in May, made public its proposed blueprint for the 2025 automated elections, which it called FASTrAC, or Fully Automated System with Transparency, Audit, and Count. Under the proposal, the commission seeks to retire 97,000 vote-counting machines (VCMs) that the Philippines has relied on since 2016, since they are already prone to glitches despite refurbishment. What the Comelec seeks to replace them with are automated counting machines (ACMs), which are still optical mark readers (OMRs), wherein voters use a paper ballot counted by machines. But the poll body also wants these machines to have direct recording electronic (DRE) capabilities, where voters use a touch screen or touch pad. This option would greatly benefit Persons With Disabilities and illiterate voters. The Comelec believes the technology is already available, and has been looking for interested suppliers. However, this ambitious reform would not be possible without big funding from Congress. Reacting to DBM’s proposal to Congress, Comelec Chairman George Garcia said the poll body would have to be more prudent. “We would have to [reduce] support staff in every precinct or increase the allocation of voters per precinct, so that we would rent fewer machines,” he said on Thursday, August 3. Comelec spokesman Rex Laudiangco also hopes that whatever lack in funding for 2024 will be made up for in the 2025 budget. “The procurement of the automated election system (AES) part of the NLE may proceed in 2024, short of award, depending on the availability of fund allotment. At any rate, while most of the components thereof are bundled, the same is clustered, and we could proceed to procure such on a lot basis, with the completion of payments being in time for the 2025 budgeting and release,” he said. – Rappler.com",

According to the Presidential Communications Office, MMC’s Joint Traffic Circular No. 01 would have increased the financial penalty for violators from P1,000 to P4,000 beginning April 15. “While I understand the intention behind the proposal, I’ve decided to prioritize discipline over penalties,” Marcos said in a video statement. “Ang Bagong Pilipino ay disiplinado (The New Filipino is disciplined.)” “By focusing on individual responsibility, we can create long-lasting solutions to our traffic challenge,” he added. The logic is reminiscent of Marcos’ earlier directive not to penalize yet e-bicycles and e-tricycles plying national roads in Metro Manila once the ban on such vehicles took effect on April 15. Marcos had said more time is needed to educate the public about the ban. On April 10, Marcos led a town hall on the capital region’s traffic woes, an apparent effort to show the government’s commitment in addressing a perennial problem in Metro Manila. During the summit, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority unveiled adjusted working hours for all local government unit employees in Metro Manila. San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora later said this policy will take effect on May 2. – Rappler.com",

Philippine National Police (PNP) officials who implemented the warrant wore body cameras, the statement said in Filipino. The Philippine government had received from the Interpol an official copy of a warrant of arrest issued by the International Criminal Court (ICC) against Duterte. “Kaninang madaling araw, natanggap ng INTERPOL Manila ang official copy ng warrant of arrest mula sa International Criminal Court (ICC),” the statement said in Filipino. (This morning, INTERPOL Manila received an official copy of the warrant of arrest from the International Criminal Court.) According to the statement, “Ika-9:20 ng umaga ngayong araw, 11 Marso 2025, ang dating Pangulong Rodrigo Duterte at ang kanyang grupo ay dumating sa Maynila mula Hong Kong sakay ng Cathay Pacific CX 907.” (President Rodrigo Duterte and his entourage were scheduled to arrive at 9:20 am today and they arrived in Manila from Hong Kong aboard Cathay Pacific CX 907.) “Sa kanyang pagdating, inihain ng Prosecutor General ang ICC notification para sa isang arrest warrant sa dating Pangulo para sa krimen laban sa sangkatauhan. Ang dating Pangulo at ang kanyang grupo ay nasa mabuting kalusugan at sinuri ng mga doctor ng gobyerno. Sinigurado na siya ay nasa maayos na kalagayan,” the PCO said. (Upon his arrival, the Prosecutor General presented to the former president, the ICC notification for an arrest over crimes against humanity. The former president and his group are in good health and were examined by government doctors. They made sure that he is in good health.) The alleged crimes against humanity were committed during his bloody war on drugs, a campaign that was launched when he became president in 2016. Going by the tallies of human rights groups, as many as 30,000 were killed in that brutal war that saw even vigilante groups participating in the killings. – Rappler.com",

Floyd said CTBTO has expressed belief that the organization has to do everything it can to protect the global norm against nuclear testing during uncertain times. Floyd also said this includes the International Monitoring System (IMS), which spans the globe and has a unique network of monitoring stations and laboratories. Floyd was scheduled to visit the IMS stations in Tanay and Tagaytay, according to the Presidential Communications Office. “It does my heart good to meet your technical people and down at the Taal Volcano observatory who are doing that work and they’re so proud of it. It was a wonderful thing yesterday to visit them,” Floyd said. Marcos has been vocal about his desire to adopt nuclear energy as one of the country's energy sources. Floyd is in Manila to participate in the 16th ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) Inter-Sessional Meeting on Non-Proliferation and Disarmament (ISM NPD). He will deliver the keynote address during the ARF ISM NPD dinner and present CTBTO’s work. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

In a message to reporters, the DOH said it already submitted recommendations to President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. regarding the extension of the state of calamity. “If the extension will not be approved, we can still continue with the COVID-19 vaccination program using existing doses considering their validity is hinged on their Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs),” it said. “But, we cannot procure additional doses, including the bivalent vaccines. Also, it is expected that the number of vaccinators will decrease as other cadres such as pharmacists may no longer be tapped, and willingness to vaccinate may decrease as immunity from liability is not guaranteed,” it added. The DOH expressed openness to alternatives to prevent the disruption of the vaccination program like the possible grant of a special authority to purchase. On Thursday, Marcos said he is still “very, very hesitant to continue the state of calamity, to extend it because again we are not in a state of calamity anymore, technically speaking.” \"And that is the wrong mindset to be approaching the New Year with. So we’re still trying to find ways to continue to provide the benefits to our medical health workers which is the main issue without the state of calamity.” According to the DOH, it would continue coordinating with Marcos and wait for his decision on the matter. The Health Department is also in discussion with vaccine manufacturers and COVAX facilities \"to secure bivalent vaccines this coming year.\" The country's state of calamity is set to expire on December 31, 2022. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

Ngayong February, nangako ulit sila na ime-meet nila yung mga kamag-anak ng mga nawawala.

They promised to meet us in February but the month is about to end and we never received updates on the date for the case conference.) Kiel is one of the six sabungeros who disappeared in a cockfighting arena in Bulacan in 2021, along with Mark Joseph Ignacio, Romualdo Diano, Eric Legaspi, and Nerio Antecristo. DOJ Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla last month said he plans to meet with the families to assure them that all efforts are being exerted to find the missing. “Ano na ang plano nila para sa amin. Hindi naman kami bibitiw kahit abutin ng ilang taon,” Bohol said. (What are their plans for us? We will continue to hold on even if it take years.) Christina Ignacio, mother of victim Mark Joseph, expressed a similar sentiment. \"Meron pa ba kaming hinihintay na hustisya? Malaking katanungan yun sa amin eh, hindi hanggang ngayon hindi kami sumusuko. Hustisya para sa kanilang pagkawala”. (Is there still justice for us? That’s our question.

DepEd Assistant Secretary Francis Bringas said that the agency will be reiterating the policy on class suspension to public schools nationwide since El Niño is likely to persist until May 2024. “Since they are the school managers, meron silang ganoong authority na naibigay sa kanila at ine-expect natin that they will exercise very wise discretion when it comes to suspension of classes, including ‘yung pagbibigay ng mga intervention activities for lost hours,” Bringas said in an Unang Balita interview. (Since they are the school managers, they are given that authority to suspend classes and we expect that they will exercise very wise discretion when it comes to the suspension of classes, including the coming up of intervention activities for lost hours.) Classes at all levels in Negros Occidental have been suspended since Monday in anticipation of a 41°C heat index in the area. Classes from elementary to senior high school levels were also suspended in Bacolod City to protect the students, teachers and other staff from unrelenting heat that may cause heat cramps, heat exhaustion or heat stroke. In preparation for the hot weather, a school in Metro Manila also prepared cold water dispensers and working electric fan units, and suspended outdoor activities. Bringas said that students and teachers could wear more comfortable clothing aside from their regular uniforms to reduce the heat they feel while inside the schools. State weather bureau PAGASA said El Niño is anticipated to persist until March-April-May 2024, with a 74% chance of a transition to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) neutral conditions in April-May-June 2024. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Marcos administration is preparing to launch another round of cash aid under the Targeted Cash Transfer (TCT) program to help ease consumers’ burden amid the continuous high inflation rate, according to Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno. “Right now, we’re considering the two-month subsidy for consumers,” Diokno told reporters on the sidelines of the 2023 Annual Reception for the Banking Community late Friday in Manila. The Finance chief said the TCT program for consumers will be launched soon as the government has already identified the funding source. “We’re just waiting for the announcement from the Palace,” he said. Some 9.3 million “poorest of the poor” will receive P1,000 which will be divided for distribution for two months, according to Diokno. The total budget for the cash aid is pegged at P9.3 billion plus 5% administration cost. The Philippines saw an inflation rate of 8.7% in January , an acceleration which surprised economic managers. This is a fresh 14-year high or the fastest inflation print since the 9.1% recorded in November 2008. The Finance chief said the upcoming cash aid for consumers would be an extension of the TCT program which was launched by the previous administration to alleviate the financial struggle of low income families amid the rise in cost of goods triggered by global oil price surge due to the Russia-Ukraine war. Under the TCT program, beneficiaries received P500 a month for six months. The last payout for the “targeted ayuda” was last month. The Department of Budget and Management has previously released a total amount of P10.33 billion to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) covering two months of cash transfers for 10 million target household beneficiaries. The DBM also released another P5.2 billion to cover the one-month requirement of the TCT program of the DSWD. Senate employees will receive a one-time P50,000 inflation allowance for 2023, Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri announced Monday. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

DOH’s bulletin logged from 6 a.m. of January 2 to 5:59 a.m. of January 3 showed that the ages of the latest victims ranged from 10 months to 77, with a median age of 18. This means that the new batch recorded the youngest and the oldest victims due to fireworks, so far. The 10-month old baby was a boy from the National Capital Region (NCR) whose right eye was injured by a legal firework “kwitis,” lit by another person inside the house. Meanwhile, the 77-year-old male from Ilocos Region was burnt by a legal firework “whistle bomb,” which was also lit by someone else at home. Ninety seven percent of the new cases occurred at home and along the streets. Legal fireworks were also used by 59 of them. DOH said only 10 individuals were hospitalized due to their injuries. Overall, there are now 557 injuries recorded in the recent holiday season. Most of them or 555 cases were due to fireworks, one was due to “watusi” ingestion, and one was due to a stray bullet. The Philippine National Police (PNP) earlier reported that two persons were killed due to firecracker and stray bullet incidents after the celebration of New Year 2024. DOH said more than half of cases (306) came from the NCR, followed by Ilocos Region with 55 cases, Central Luzon with 42 cases, and Calabarzon with 39 cases. The fireworks that caused most injuries were kwitis, 5-star, pla-pla, boga, whistle bomb, luces, and fountain. Uptrend since 2020 The DOH's surveillance year (SY) starts on December 21 and ends on January 5 of the following year. The agency logged its largest increase in FWRI in SY 2022 with 307 cases—62% higher than the 189 cases in SY 2021. The least FWRI cases was recorded in SY 2020 with 123 cases. This was attributed to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. For SY 2023, DOH said access to fireworks was higher because it was the first Yuletide holiday celebration after the lifting of the State of Public Health Emergency due to COVID-19. —AOL, VDV, GMA Integrated News",

And ‘pag hindi nila ginawa ‘yung utos ko, puwede kong sitahin,\" he added. Marcos indicated that a secretary may still listen to appeals when he or she decides on how to move forward. \"So that’s what I bring to the position is that when I make a decision, I say this is what we need to do, this is the plan, every one of you follow this plan, you do this, you will do that,\" Marcos said. \"Kailangan masunod ‘yun. And if not, then... I can chastise them, I can move them aside, push them into other positions, etc.,\" he added. \"Generally speaking, if the President asked you to do something, they’ll do it.

    "article_body": "The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on Friday assisted a Davao City resident in filing criminal and administrative charges against two barangay officials for allegedly stealing a portion of her cash assistance. DSWD Field Office-11 Regional Director Vanessa Goc-ong and Anne Villarin jointly executed a complaint affidavit before the local Office of the Ombudsman in the Davao Region. The DSWD said that the chief of Barangay Sinawilan and a barangay kagawad admitted in an interview with Brigada News FM Davao that P8,500 was deducted from the P10,000 cash aid to Villarin. Villarin, who is a pregnant woman, tearfully shared in her viral video that she was only left with P1,500 from her payout for the Presidential Assistance to Farmers, Fishermen, and their Families program last June 6 after she was informed that she had to remit the money to the barangay hall. The DSWD assured that it would assist Villarin throughout the pendency of the case. “Our office has also provided Mrs. Villarin with an additional Php8,500 because she refused to accept the money being returned by the barangay officials after the post went viral,” said DWSD spokesperson Irene Dumlao. The DSWD reminded local government officials that cash aid should be given in full to all beneficiaries.

We’re talking about air assets and can add more if kailangan pa [if still needed]. We have already a number of air assets in positions in the area in coordination with the Northern Luzon command.

Earlier, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake struck Abra at 8:43 a.m. according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. Its epicenter was located three kilometers northwest of Tayum, Abra, and had a depth of 17 kilometers. Faustino said the Office of Civil Defense had already issued emergency alerts and warning messages to advise the public on the incident. The Defense Department’s rapid assessment of the status of roads and bridges, critical lifelines, and infrastructure, the status of houses, total affected population, immediate needs, road clearing operations, and data gathering on submission of reports in the affected areas is also ongoing, he added. — RSJ, GMA News",

    "article_body": "Retail prices of rice are expected to rise in the next few weeks due to high palay farmgate prices amid the dry season, higher cost of inputs, and low buffer stock, an official of the Department of Agriculture (DA) said. “Our projection is an increase of P5 [per kilo]… that’s the maximum,” DA Assistant Secretary and deputy spokesperson Rex Estoperez told reporters in a recent interview. The DA official cited the high procurement price of rice between P22 and P23 per kilo. “During the Summer harvest season, prices are normally high because the palay is already dry… Plus, the cost of inputs are also increasing,” Estoperez said. “This is a normal occurrence during Summer… Price levels are abnormal and have already reached P23,” he added. Another factor in the expected increase in the prices of the staple is the lower inventory which is only good for 51 days, a far cry from the comfortable level of 90 days. Data from the Philippine Statistics Authority showed that as of January, the rice inventory nationwide fell to 1.77 million metric tons (MT) or by 30.3% from 253 million MT. Year-on-year, rice inventory shrank by 5.1% from 1.86 million MT. Estoperez said the country’s rice stockpile should be 37,000 MT a day, good for 90 days or 3.33 million MT. Data from the DA’s price monitoring as of April 4 showed that the price per kilo of local well-milled rice range from P39 to P46, while the regular-milled variety costs P34 to P40 per kilo. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2023-04-28T02:57:00",
    "article_body": "President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. has instructed the Department of Tourism (DOT) to assess non-operating tourism zones under the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA) as part of efforts to boost the country's tourism industry. According to the Presidential Communications Office, Marcos issued the remarks during a meeting with the Private Sector Advisory Council (PSAC) Tourism Sector Group on Thursday, where they presented updates on previous recommendations and new proposals to boost the sector. \"I'm happy that the general direction… that means that we are actually… have already started. There are some very good suggestions,\" the President said. However, Marcos said the TIEZA's problem seems to be its non-operating properties. TIEZA is a government-owned and controlled corporation (GOCC) attached to the DOT and is responsible for implementing policies and programs of the DOT pertaining to the development, promotion, and supervision of tourism projects in the country. Apart from the updates, the participants at the meeting also explored the best ways forward for the GOCC and ways to manage its assets. The PSAC reported that TIEZA's primary source of funding comes from travel tax collection, which is insufficient to support its project requirements. Under the Tourism Act of 2009, 50% of travel tax goes to TIEZA, while 40% is allocated to Higher Education Development Fund to enable the CHED to prioritize tourism-related educational programs and courses. The remaining 10% goes to the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA). As a remedy, PSAC's recommendations include amending the allocation of Travel Tax for funding for TIEZA and expanding the list of priority tourism-related investment activities, among others. The advisory body's medium- and long-term recommendations include reviewing, simplifying, and standardizing the privatization or bidding process, leveraging properties to undertake more tourism infrastructure projects, and establishing and issuing a long-term Strategic Tourism Infrastructure and Investment Masterplan. On the proposal to grant more allocation for TIEZA from the travel tax, the DOT said the move requires amendment to the law, and may not materialize within a year, as eyed by the PSAC. Responding to the proposal to exclude asset operation from TIEZA's mandate, the tourism GOCC said such function may be transferred to private partners instead. The PSAC is composed of business leaders and industry experts who provide technical advice to the President in achieving the government's economic objectives, particularly in six key sectors such as agriculture; digital infrastructure; healthcare; infrastructure; jobs generation; and tourism. -- BAP, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2022-09-27T14:46:00",
    "article_body": "Environment Secretary Ma. Antonia Yulo Loyzaga on Tuesday said she was in favor of small-scale mining in the country but its environmental impact should be strictly monitored at the local government level. \"We are very much in favor of small-scale mining as a means to lift certain populations out of their condition, socio-economically,\" said Loyzaga during the Commission on Appointments Committee on Environment and Natural Resources hearing on her ad interim appointment. \"However, we do feel, at least at the DENR at the moment, that we need to strengthen our capacity to observe, to monitor, to evaluate the environmental impacts of these activities at the local level,\" she added. Loyzaga said the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) had initial conversations on how they could coordinate closely with the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) on the monitoring of these small-scale mining activities. \"We have had initial conversations already on how we might be able to coordinate more closely with the DILG, in particular, in order for us to be able to maintain some integrity in the ecosystems despite the necessity of this activity being made available to communities who actually need the incomes at the barangay and at the community level,\" she added. Camarines Sur Rep. Luis Raymund Villafuerte, who asked about Loyzaga's stand on small-scale mining, inquired about the current number of legal small-scale mining activities across the Philippines. Loyzaga said there were 50 recognized Minahang Bayan projects at the moment. However, Villafuerte lamented that 31 years after the Small-Scale Mining Act was passed, only 50 were considered legal at the moment. \"I'm sure you know that there are probably hundreds of illegal small-scale miners waiting to be accredited,\" he said. Loyzaga responded that the DENR would conduct a full review of the approval process, not only of the small-scale mining activities but as well as the other activities that concern the environment. \"This will actually allow us to determine where the gaps are in terms of translating policy into actual implementation at the local level. I think at this juncture, it is very crucial for us to keep in close coordination with the DILG because as you mentioned there are possibly hundreds, if not more, illegal small-scale mining activities which we will need the cooperation of the LGU in order for us to act, identify and monitor and make that part of the formalization process under this law,\" she said. Villafuerte suggested reviewing the licensing requirements as this might be \"too expensive\" for small-scale miners. For her part, Senator Cynthia Villar, who chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Natural Resources, cautioned Loyzaga of small-scale mining being used as a front for big mining companies. \"You have to be careful na wag gamitin ng mga illegal miners 'yung mga small-scale miners para ma-circumvent nila yung law. Kasi maraming local governments in Mindanao were telling me that when I'm visiting Mindanao,\" said Villar. The CA panel eventually endorsed confirmation of Loyzaga's appointment as DENR Secretary to the plenary. — DVM, GMA News",

The PCO said EO 32 also mandated the creation of a technical working group (TWG) composed of the following agencies: Under the IRR, unified application form will be adopted, in which preformatted form building permit applications shall be prescribed in all cities and municipalities in the country. Those applying for a building permit shall be required to submit property documents, technical documents, height clearance permit, and homeowners association (HOA) clearance, together with the unified application form. It also said that to secure a Certificate of Use and a Business or Mayor’s permit, applicants should submit the following, among others: The IRR also set the requirements for the erection of poles and construction of underground fiber ducts, cable layout on existing poles and other physical infrastructure, as well as the operation, repair and maintenance of passive telecommunications tower infrastructure (PTIIs), including distribution utility facilities. Rules for securing clearances from other government agencies and local government’s adoption of EO No. 32 were also spelled out in the IRR. It mandates all cities to set up a One-Stop Shop for Construction Permits, preferably at the Office of the Building Official, which will provide frontline services to applicants securing building permits and other certificates related to telecommunications and internet infrastructure. The IRR also prohibits anti-competitive activities and directs agencies and local government units (LGUs) to implement zero-backlog policy in all application for permits and clearances covered under the order. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2022-11-18T09:17:00",
    "article_body": "The Human Rights Watch (HRW) on Friday called out the Philippine National Police (PNP) for supposedly undercounting the number of fatalities in anti-illegal drug operations since the start of Marcos administration. In a statement, HRW Deputy Asia Director Phil Robertson said an independent institute has monitored 127 deaths from July 1 to November 7, which is higher than the 46 reported by the PNP for the same period. “The police reported that 46 people were killed during anti-drug operations since Marcos took office on June 30,” Robertson said. “But this is far below the estimate of the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center, whose Dahas program monitors 'drug war' violence. The program tallied that 127 people were killed in 'drug war' incidents from July 1, the day after Marcos was sworn in, to November 7,” he added. According to Robertson, the PNP sought to downplay recent killings in the “war on drugs” by claiming that the number of drug war deaths since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s inauguration was “very minimal.” “Even if one accepts the PNP’s figures, calling this death toll 'very minimal' smacks of insensitivity and callousness,” he said. In a recent forum, PNP chief Police General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. said only 46 drug suspects have been killed in the over 18,500 police operations since the start of the Marcos administration. Around 22,000 arrests have also been recorded so far, Azurin added. Robertson said authorities did not take actions to shift its focus on rehabilitation and their efforts are just “rights abusing” because they are involuntary, coercive, and expose drug users to further stigma. “In September, [Marcos] said he wanted to focus on rehabilitation, but there is no evidence that the authorities have done anything to make such a shift,” he said. Regarding rehabilitation, PNP Public Information Office chief Police Colonel Redrico Maranan told GMA News Online that from July 2016 to October 2022, a total of 654,228 drug users had graduated from the government's rehabilitation program. “Our record shows that a total of 654,228 persons who used drugs graduated from joint PNP and [local government units] initiated and supported Recovery and Wellness Program from July 2016 to October 2022,” he said in a message. The HRW, meanwhile, also called out supposed misleading assertions the Philippine government made in its defense from human rights issues during the Universal Periodic Review of the Philippines recently. “But so far, all that has been forthcoming from the new administration has been inflated rhetoric masking empty claims,” Robertson said. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla, for his part, shrugged off HRW's claims. \"Not all views are objective, as they were colored and poisoned by NGOs (non-government organizations) towing NDF lines,\" Remulla told GMA News Online in a message, referring to the communist group National Democratic Front. — with Joahna Lei Casilao/KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) is looking to have local banks shift from one-time passwords (OTPs) to more advanced methods as part of its efforts to address fraud and financial crime, according to a top official. Speaking with reporters, BSP deputy Governor Elmore Capule cited the need to shift into more sophisticated systems to make structures in the country more future-proof, with a draft circular recently released to boost the information technology risk management of financial institutions. “Our objective is to make our OTPs future-proof, meaning, you know how technology is. If you say that what we have right now is efficient, then by next week or next year, it may no longer be,” he said Thursday.. “What we are saying is that we are encouraging the banks to go on a higher level of protection. While what we have now is maybe sufficient for now, we want them to continually upgrade,” he added. This comes as other countries have started to shift from OTPs as methods to be able to access bank accounts digitally, given the increase in financial scams, which phishing and smishing accounting bulk of this. “That’s where we are coming from. We are looking at the banks having more sophisticated systems in place,” Capule said. “Our basis is, it really depends on how sophisticated your system and the bank is. Like if you’re talking of a rural bank or a thrift bank, perhaps we’ll be satisfied with the OTPs. But if you’re looking at, let’s say, digital banks, then a digital bank means your system should be more robust and more advanced,” he added. Capule declined to give a timeline as to the shift from OTPs, with the BSP now soliciting feedback from industry stakeholders on the move. “Conceptual pa lang ‘yun that we have to move away from the traditional but perhaps we have a consultation with the industry, exactly how long do they think they can institute. Hindi pa namin ma-hardcorde ‘yung period,” he said. The BSP is also looking to release the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) of the Anti-Financial Account Scamming Act (AFASA) by March or early April, for the law to become effective 15 days after publication. Signed by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. into law in July 2024, AFASA seeks to protect the public from cybercriminals and criminal synidicates by penalizing financial cybercrimes and imposing harsher penalties for illegal acts. Under the law, the BSP is authorized to investigate cases, apply for cybercrime warrants and orders, and request the assistance of law enforcers in the investigation of cases. It is also exempted from existing laws on bank secrecy and data privacy to gather sufficient information relative to the commission of prohibited acts. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2023-04-27T23:59:00",
    "article_body": "Motorists may use temporary license plates due to supply shortage but they should be able to present supporting documents including proof of authorization, according to the Land Transportation Office (LTO). “Improvised for the time being. Ngayon, huhulihin po ba kayo? Malamang po hihintuin kayo ng law enforcers...Kailangan nyo pong ipakita yung authorization to use improvised plate na binigay ng LTO at kailangan nyo rin pong ipakita ang OR/CR [Official Receipt (OR) Certificate of Registration (CR)],” LTO chief Jay Art Tugade said in Joseph Morong’s report on “24 Oras”. (Improvised for the time being. Now, will they be apprehended? Most probably, yes. You have to show authorization to use improvised plates given by LTO and OR/CR.) Tugade on Wednesday said the agency is expecting the supply of license plates for motorcycles to run out by June and plates for four-wheeled vehicles will run out by July due to the delays in procurement. The LTO chief earlier said they are working on a contingency plan in which they would allow motorcycle and vehicle owners to use temporary license plates. However, he clarified the measure is only applicable for motorists who have existing plates but were lost or damaged. He also said owners of brand new vehicles should ask their dealers for temporary plates and for replacements. “Bawal gumawa ng plaka, bawal mag imprenta ng sariling plaka, bawal po yung do it yourself plate. Wrong. Kinakabitan po kayo ng dealer ng temporary plate,” said Tugade. (Making and printing your own plate is prohibited. Do it yourself plates are not allowed. That’s wrong. Car dealers provide temporary plates.) The LTO has a backlog of at least 11 million license plates from 2012 up to the first half of 2022, according to Tugade. He, however, warned the delay may persist longer due to the shortage of blank plates. Senator Grace Poe has called on the Land Transportation Office (LTO) to provide the public a complete report the status of the supply of plates and license. “We ask the LTO to give the public a complete report on its backlog on vehicle plates and license cards to give a complete picture of the issues it is facing. With this, we also expect to know its timeline for clearing its deficiencies and how it will do it,” Poe, chairperson of the Senate public services committee, said in a statement. The LTO said the procurement of the blank plates and the licenses are now in the hands of the Department of Transportation (DoTr), which is now in charge of contracts worth over P50 million. The DoTr has set a meeting with the Budget and Management Department to start the bidding process for the procurement. -- Sundy Locus/BAP, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The government financial institutions financing the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) have sufficient capital strength to bankroll the proposed sovereign wealth fund, the Governance Commission for Government-owned and Controlled Corporations (GCG) said Friday. “Generally, our government financial institutions are financially healthy and viable based on publicly available financial information as of June 30 2022,” said GCG Director Atty. Lovely Joy Avisado said at a press briefing in Makati City. “The GOCs involved in the Maharlika Investment Fund are compliant with the 10% capital adequacy ratio required by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP),” Avisado said. Capital adequacy ratio refers to the ratio of a bank's or financial institution’s capital to its assets. The House Bill 6608, approved by the House of Representatives on second and third reading, seeks to maximize the investible funds of state-run financial institutions and ultimately increase public funds for nation-building. Under the measure, the MIF would be funded by the investible resources of the Land Bank of the Philippine (P50 billion), the Development Bank of the Philippines (P25 billion), and the dividends or profits of the BSP. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had certified the measure as urgent, which paved the way for its second and third reading approvals on the same day. Avisado said the commission had submitted its comments to Congress during several committee hearings. “We expressed that in exempting the Maharlika Investment Corporation from the GCG law or Republic Act No. 10149, the bill must include safeguards, including against the possible abuses and corruption by its board of directors,” she said. “The GCG is of the position that so long as the proposed measure can ensure accountability and transparency of the fund [under] the Maharlika Investment Corporation, then we can convey our support to the proposed bill,” she added. Among the safeguards included in the House-approved version of the bill was the provision prohibiting the MIF Corporation from investing in the following entities and companies: For his part, GCG Commissioner Gideon Mortel expressed support for the provision in the measure that members of the board of the MIF Corporation “will be subjected to the selection and nomination process of the GCG.” “Now the bill will be passed to the Senate. GCG is continuously monitoring the progress of this bill as it would impact on GOCCs where some of the capital and resources will come from. So we are monitoring the progress of this bill,” Mortel said. The authors of the MIF bill originally planned for the investible funds of the GSIS and the SSS to be included as sources for the proposed sovereign wealth fund's capital, an idea they later dropped after pensioners expressed their concerns, according co-author Representative Stella Quimbo. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

In an ambush interview, Remulla said the DOJ will file the case against both government officials and private citizens if they fail to meet the deadline set by the oil spill inter-agency committee. “Meron kaming deadline na binigay and if they are not able to abide by the deadline, we will file a writ of kalikasan case,” he said. The writ of kalikasan is a remedy for unlawful actions \"on behalf of persons whose constitutional right to a balanced and healthful ecology is violated, or threatened with violation by an unlawful act or omission of a public official or employee, or private individual or entity, involving environmental damage of such magnitude as to prejudice the life, health or property of inhabitants in two or more cities or provinces.\" Remulla explained that a writ of kalikasan is a special civil action taken to enjoin individuals to repair the environment. Justice Undersecretary Raul Vasquez earlier said that the government gave P&I, the insurer of the MT Princess Empress, a 10-day deadline to submit a written undertaking. Vasquez said the PI committed to doing the retrieval operations. Meanwhile, when asked why government agencies will be included, Remulla said this was because they must also look at the regulatory bodies involved. “And to make sure that they are doing their job. Because sometimes failure of governance that is contributory to the accident… to the incidents that happened,” he said. The MT Princess Empress sank off Najuan, Oriental Mindoro on February 28 while carrying 900,000 liters of industrial fuel. The resulting leak has affected ecologies, livelihoods, and residents' health in Oriental Mindoro and nearby provinces. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

The DMW will conduct Financial Awareness Seminars and Small Business Management Training (FAS-SBMT) for selected and qualified OFWs to provide the assistance they need to jumpstart their agribusiness livelihood initiatives. In the meantime, the DA will provide enterprise business development services to prospective OFW agri-preneurs, including access to markets, financing, resource institutions, and technical support in managing their agribusiness venture. \"We hope to see our OFWs prosper in Philippine agriculture and every business. Our efforts will be harmonized with the DMW to ensure a successful implementation of this initiative,” said DA Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. Reintegration is a key development agenda of the DMW as it fulfills its mandate to further harness the potential of OFWs as co-architects of national economic development, even as they continue their labor journey in the country for good. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The five Chinese suspects allegedly involved in human trafficking operations that were arrested during a police raid in Las Piñas City have been ordered released pending further investigation, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said Monday. In a media briefing, Remulla slammed the Philippine National Police-Anti-Cybercrime Group (PNP-ACG) for supposedly failing to coordinate with the Department of Justice (DOJ) before conducting the raid. “Manghuhuli pero walang kaso. Ano, magtatanim ka ng kaso? Hindi puwede sa DOJ. Hindi kami papayag diyan [Arresting people without cases. What, cases will be invented? The DOJ will not agree to that],” Remulla said. According to Remulla, many pending cases could not be filed due to lack of evidence. When asked about the supposed blunders of the PNP-ACG, he said the policemen did not cite specific acts or specific grounds to arrest the said individuals. “Basta raid lang, raid, ganon… Pumasok lang sila. Parang nangingisda [They just raided… they just entered the premises. As if they were fishing],” he said. On June 30, the five Chinese nationals identified as Li Jiacheng, alias Li Jiachang, Xiao Liu, alias Xiao Lin, Yan Jiayong, alias Pan Wen Jie, Duan Haozhuan, and LP Hongkun, alias Li Yang, underwent inquest proceedings at the DOJ. They were arrested after police authorities rescued almost 3,000 individuals from a compound in the city . Of this, 1,534 were Filipinos and 1,190 were from Malaysia, Singapore, China, and Vietnam. According to Remulla, around 1,000 victims are still in the country. He said all the Filipinos have returned home while they are processing the cancelation of the visas of the other victims. “Yan ang problema kapag ayaw kasi makinig eh. Sinasabi na namin na mag-usap muna tayo bago kayo kikilos tapos gusto nila file kami ng file ng kaso kahit wala kaming ebidensya. Hindi namin gagawin yun,” he said. (This is the problem when people refuse to listen. We’ve said that we should first coordinate before acting and now they want us to file a case even without evidence. We will not do that.) Remulla said he has yet to talk with PNP chief Police General Benjamin Acorda Jr. as he had just returned to work following his bypass surgery, but expressed that he wants to. —KBK/NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. on Wednesday said no country is supportive of China’s claim over the whole of the South China Sea. Teodoro issued the remark in response to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs saying that the Philippines is provoking activities and creating trouble in the South China Sea. “My response to that is that only China believes in what they are saying. Truth and, in fact, no country in the world, none, supports unequivocally their claim to the whole of the South China Sea,” Teodoro said in an ambush interview. In addition to the Philippines, ASEAN members Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have overlapping claims with China in parts of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce. The Philippines includes areas of the South China Sea that falls within its exclusive economic zone and continental shelf as part of the West Philippine Sea. A Reuters report said China \"will keep the door of dialogue and contact open,\" quoting a spokesperson for its embassy in Manila as saying in a statement later on Wednesday. \"China has always advocated and remains committed to properly managing maritime differences through dialogue and consultation,\" the embassy's spokesperson said. Pressure China Last week, Teodoro said the Philippines and the international community should pressure China into behaving responsibly amid tensions in the disputed waters . He said China is also using “swarming tactics” in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ). When sought for comment at the time, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said they hoped the Philippines would “face up to the root cause of the issue, stop making provocations and creating trouble, and safeguard peace and stability” in the West Philippine Sea. In contrast, Teodoro said many supported the Philippines' sovereignty. “Now on the Philippine side, a lot of countries support our sovereignty and jurisdiction and sovereign rights over the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and other areas where we have territorial jurisdiction, and no country in the world, none, to this type has condemned the Philippines in what it is doing,” he said. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration concluded that China has no legal basis to claim historic rights to resources within the sea areas falling within the ‘nine-dash line.’ China, however, has said that it does not recognize the ruling . The Philippine government is also eyeing to file an environmental case against China over concerns in the WPS by 2024. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

In a viral video, the beneficiary tearfully shared how she received P10,000 from the DSWD Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS) but was left with only P1,500 after the barangay official allegedly took P8,500 to supposedly give to other recipients. \"Ongoing na pina-file ‘yung affidavit of complaint,” DSWD Spokesperson Irene Dumlao told Marisol Abdurahman 24 Oras report Tuesday.

    "article_body": "The Philippines’ sugar production will likely go down in the 2024 crop year, mainly due to the effects of El Niño phenomenon, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). In its report, the USDA said the country’s raw sugar production may decline to 1.8 million metric tons (MT), which is 100,000 MT lower than its earlier projection of 1.9 million MT. The American agricultural agency’s projection is lower, but still close to the Sugar Regulatory Administration’s (SRA) forecast of 1.85 M metric tons for Crop Year 2023-2024, equivalent to an estimated drop of 10% to 15% . Similar to what the SRA cited as a factor, the USDA explained that the expected raw sugar decline was attributed to the ongoing El Niño phenomenon. Moreover, the American agricultural agency cited declining sugarcane planting areas and weather disturbances as factors that could affect sugar production in the Philippines. In anticipation of lower production, the SRA assigned all raw sugar output for domestic consumption. The USDA is expecting that the Philippines will not import raw sugar in a bid to protect producers, however, it said refined sugar importation amounting 240,000 MT could be necessitated to stabilize consumer prices and provide two months worth of buffer stock. “This includes the 150,000 MT refined imports approved by President Marcos as stated in Sugar Order No. 7. Consumption stays at 2.2 million MT as prices remain elevated,” the USDA said. The Philippines’ sugar crop year 2023 begins on September 1, 2023 and ends on August 31, 2024. The SRA earlier said it is mandated to institute measures and ensure the stability of domestic sugar supply. The sugar industry regulator had said that it has the power to establish and maintain a balanced relationship between sugar production and the requirements of sugar, and to maintain such marketing conditions as it will ensure stabilized prices at levels reasonably profitable to the producers and fair to consumers. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "TOKYO — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said Wednesday that his five-day visit here is expected to forge closer ties between the Philippines and Japan in ensuring security in the Asia-Pacific region. Asked by reporters how he wants to improve cooperation with Japan in the South China Sea, Marcos said that “Japan wants to develop more and make our relationship even more robust and closer, especially in that regard.” “This is a new element to our relationship because we are now talking about the security of the region,” the President said in an interview with reporters while aboard a flight to Japan. Marcos said the Philippines’ dealings with Japan usually involve government-to-government, aid, grants, and commerce. In his pre-departure speech in Manila, the chief executive said his visit is part of a larger foreign policy agenda to forge closer political ties, stronger defense and security cooperation, as well as lasting economic partnerships with major countries in the region. “So being, of course, all interested in the same things, i.e., security in the region, I think cooperation is not a bad thing,” Marcos said. Marcos’ Japan visit—his ninth official overseas trip since he assumed office—came on the heels of the decision by Manila and Washington to designate four new sites in the Philippines under the Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA). Marcos was also asked if the Philippines would forge a visiting forces agreement or a similar one with Japan. “The VFA equivalent, hindi pa talaga namin napag-uusapan formally ‘yan (we haven't formally discussed that),” the President said. “I don’t know if Prime Minister Kishida will take it up with me on this trip. But, so far, there have not been any formal proposals in that regard,” he said. Nonetheless, Marcos said Japan has been supporting the Philippine Coast Guard’s maritime security mandate by providing the agency with patrol vessels. “Siguro, sa kanilang palagay, the next step is to do the improvements and rehabilitation sa Subic para sa Coast Guard because, naturally, the reason behind all this is that they would like to have more patrols along—up and down the South China Sea, para naman we can assure the freedom of passage,” Marcos said. (Probably in their view, the next step is to do the improvements and rehabilitation of Subic Port for the Coast Guard, because, naturally, the reason behind all this is that they would like to have more patrols along and down the South China Sea so we can assure freedom of passage.) — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Senators expressed their support Thursday to newly-sworn President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., vowing cooperation in passing important measures in the Upper Chamber. Re-elected Senator Joel Villanueva lauded Marcos' mention of the importance of job opportunities, technical vocation training, and fair wages in his inaugural speech. \"We will coordinate with the economic managers of the new administration, especially with incoming [Department of Migrant Workers] Sec. Toots Ople and incoming Labor Sec. Bienvenido Laguesma, so we can work on programs for the welfare and development of our workers,\" Villanueva, former chairman of the Senate labor and employment committee, said. Among these programs are the institutionalization of the National Employment Strategy and the TUPAD Emergency Employment program. He highlighted the importance of institutionalizing these programs as these are \"very appropriate for addressing the effects of the current crises on our workers, particularly those from the transportation and agriculture sectors.\" Senator Bong Go, confidant of former President Rodrigo Duterte, said he is looking forward \"to working hard with my fellow legislators and helping realize the aspirations of your administration for our people.\" He promised to continue to push for various bills that will further strengthen adaptability and resilience as one nation, particularly in health, infrastructure, food security, economy, better governance and welfare of our people, among others. \"With a solid foundation inherited from the Duterte Administration, paraphrasing your inaugural speech, we will build on the successes that are already happening in our country, continue to make the lives of our people more comfortable, and ensure that no Filipino will be left behind in our road towards fuller recovery,\" he said. \"Mr. President, kaisa ninyo ako na ipagpapatuloy ang mga tamang nagawa, punuan pa ang anumang pagkukulang at mas lalong pagbutihin ang ating pagseserbisyo upang lubos na maisakatuparan ang mga pangarap ng bawat Pilipino,\" he added. (Mr. President, I am one with you in continuing the right program, addressing any shortcoming, and further enhancing services in order to fulfill the aspirations of every Filipino.) With Marcos' message of unity, Go expressed confidence that the government will overcome the challenges that the country faces today and will face in the future. Returning Senator Jinggoy Estrada, in a Facebook post, also promised his full support to the Marcos administration in order to address the problems of the society and uplift the lives of the Filipinos. Marcos earlier took his oath as the 17th president of the Philippines after he won the 2022 elections with 58% of the votes. —AOL, GMA News",

DA spokesperson Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa was asked if the P30 rice price in July is achievable after House Speaker Ferdinand Martin Romualdez said that it is possible. “Ito naman ay ginagawa na ng National Irrigation Administration, Kadiwa dahil meron silang tinatawag nating contract farming,” De Mesa told Unang Balita in an interview. (The NIA and Kadiwa are already working on this because they have what we call contract farming.) In contract farming between the National Food Authority (NFA) and farmers’ cooperatives, De Mesa said the production inputs will be subsidized by the government. “In return ay ibebenta nila 'yung palay sa NFA. Sigurado tayo na mas magiging mura 'yung production input at dahil dito ay merong pagkakataon talaga na maibenta ng mas mura sa pamilihan 'yung palay,” he added. (In return they will sell the rice to the NFA. We are sure that the production input will be cheaper, so there is an opportunity to sell the rice at lower prices in the market.) On Sunday, the DA said the price of local regular milled rice was P50 per kilo , and P48 to P55 per kilo for local well-milled rice. As for imported commercial rice, the regular milled rice was priced at P48 to P51 per kilo, while well-milled rice was at P51 to P54. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

SIM card registration was higher in urban areas (60%) than in rural areas (51%), the SWS said. Among those who registered, 72% said the SIM card registration process was “very/somewhat easy” and 28% said it was “somewhat/very hard.” Majorities across basic demographics said the SIM card registration process was “very/somewhat easy,” except in Mindanao at only 54%. The percentage of registrants who said the registration process was easy were higher in urban areas at 75% than in rural areas at 65%. It was also slightly higher among those who either had senior high school, vocational school, college, or postgraduate education. The First Quarter 2023 SWS was conducted from March 26-29, 2023, using face-to-face interviews of 1,200 adults nationwide: 300 each in Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The sampling error margins are ±2.8% for national percentages, ±5.7% each for Metro Manila, Balance Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Under the SIM Card Registration Act, users have 180 days, or until April 26, 2023, to register their SIM cards or else face the risk of having these deactivated.

Dubbed the 'Kontra Bigay Program,' the agreement is also in collaboration with other government agencies with the aim of ensuring an honest and peaceful elections. \"We're ready to support Comelec to safeguard the ballot. Labanan natin ang pagbili at pagbebenta ng boto, isang pinakamasamang kanser ng lipunan,” said DILG Secretary Benhur Abalos during his speech. (Let us fight vote-buying and vote-selling, which are the worst cancers in society.) Both agencies have spearheaded an information campaign against vote-buying and vote-selling in all LGUs. “Sa maliit na pagboto, pakita nating hindi natin ibebenta at iluluklok natin ang karapat-dapat,” Secretary Abalos advised the voters. (Let us show them that we won't be selling out votes and give the position to those who deserve it.) Meanwhile, Comelec Chairman George Erwin Garcia mentioned that the poll body has issued show-cause orders against more than 6,000 candidates as of October 11. Among the figures, 1,300 candidates responded, while 96 were issued disqualification cases. Comelec aims to resolve the cases before election day. \"It is our commitment that before October 30, we will disqualify candidates to prove to them that Comelec is so serious in our fight against premature campaigning,\" Garcia said. “Ipapakita natin sa mga kantidato, hindi natin sila papaupuin kung sila ay makakakuha ng premature campaigning and vote-buying at mapapatunayan na sila ay nag-commit nito,” he added. (Let us show the candidates they cannot assume their post if they are involved in premature campaigning and vote-buying.) Moreover, the Commission En Banc has also decided to allow the suspension of any candidate proclamation if there is an existing disqualification case. “Yan ay isang remediyo na meron ang comelec at gagamitin namin ang kapagyarihan na yon. Sixty ang pending na vote-buying (cases), gusto nating turuan sila ng leksyon na sesryosohin nila ang mga patakaran na meron ang Commission on Elections at diyan namin kailangan talaga ang DILG,” Garcia said.

However, Palace Press Officer Undersecretary Atty. Claire Castro said there is no timeline yet for the meeting of the two leaders. “They expressed their intention to pursue a leaders' meeting at appropriate time,” Castro told GMA Integrated News’ Unang Balita in an interview. “Wala pa po tayong definite kung anong timeline pero nandoon pa rin po 'yung intention na ipagpatuloy po ito (We don't have a definite timeline yet but the intention to continue this is still there),\" she added. On Monday, Reuters reported that Marcos is keen to meet Trump and is ready to go immediately when the US president is available. Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez said the meeting could be in the spring. According to him, the Philippines was seeking to import LNG from United States as part of a \"give and take\" on trade. He reiterated existing defense arrangements between the two security allies would remain in place. Meanwhile, Marcos' openness to meet Trump happens as the Philippines seeks to further bolster its alliance with its long-time treaty ally amid the increasingly aggressive China in the West Philippine Sea. Romualdez said the White House is “aware” of Manila’s intention for a one-on-one meeting between the two leaders. “They've indicated that we put together some of the things that I think would be important for us for the discussion to take place,” he said “We're waiting for the White House to give us an invitation.

    "article_body": "The agriculture sector’s estimated cost of damage due to Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (international name: Nalgae) has now reached P4.2 billion, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said Wednesday. Based on NDRRMC’s 6 a.m. situational report, the Department of Agriculture (DA) recorded a total of P4,270,676,568.424 production loss or cost of damage in Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol Region, Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Bangsamoro Region, and Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). At least 109,489 fisherfolks and farmers were also affected by the damage into 121,287.655 hectares of crop area. Of which, 86,061.775 hectares were partially damaged and still have a chance of recovery, while 36,124 hectares were totally damaged and no longer have chance of recovery. There were also 5,806 damaged infrastructure, machinery, and equipment because of Paeng. Cagayan Valley logged the highest amount of damage at P1,217,948,410. 989. This was followed by Bicol Region at P924,124,008.65, and Calabarzon at P726,119,476.09. The National Irrigation Administration, meanwhile, posted a P96,102,000 cost of damage in Cagayan Valley and the Bicol Region. Moreover, Paeng’s damage to 820 infrastructure already climbed to P4,665,856,137.88. Calabarzon still recorded the highest amount of damage, involving 113 infrastructure at P1,245,830,800. Mimaropa was next with 269 damaged infrastructure amounting to P997,052,772, and then Bicol Region with 180 damaged infrastructure at P793,374,689.99. The reported death toll due to Paeng, on the other hand, slightly increased to 159 from 158 on Tuesday. Thirty people were still reportedly missing, while 147 were injured. There were also 5,299,716 affected people or 1,315,083 families in 9,680 barangays. At least 214 evacuation centers still catered to 46,255 displaced individuals or 10,283 families, while 1,071,233 people or 215,629 families were staying outside of evacuation centers. The NDRRMC also recorded 53,229 houses damaged due to Paeng, amounting to P17,286,000. Of these houses, 48,248 were partially damaged, and 4,981 were totally damaged. There were 112 roads and 58 bridges that were also still not passable.

    "date_published": "2025-03-31T21:03:00",
    "article_body": "The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday implemented the P45 per kilo maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) for imported rice. According to Darlene Cay’s “24 Oras” report, the DA said the new MSRP will be retained for the next two months, which was lowered from its previous P49 price per kilo. However, some rice retailers at the Mega Q Market in Quezon City said they will be able to follow the new MSRP next week when the next delivery arrives. The DA also said it will recommend imposing higher rice tariffs to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, pork prices range around P400 per kilo in Metro Manila based on DA’s monitoring. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. expressed disappointment since only 30% of retailers were able to follow the pork MSRP despite it being implemented about a month ago. “I'm disappointed dahil may usapan. Dapat sundin ang usapan (I’m disappointed because there’s an agreement that should be followed),” Laurel said. He added that there is no reason not to follow the MSRP. The DA also said liempo, for example, has a farmgate price of P230 per kilo, so there is a possibility that someone is taking advantage of the cost. The agency also said it would file charges against those found selling overpriced pork if needed or ask the House Quinta Committee for an investigation. “And that is already bordering on profiteering,” Laurel said. In Mega Q Market, pork retailers were able to follow the MSRP, but some said they were burdened with debt. “Kailangan namin ng ayuda ng DA dahil lubog na lubog na kami sa utang (We need aid from the DA since we’re burdened with debt,” pork retailer Elizabeth Espino said. Pork retailers said they earned about P1,000 for each pig, but with the rental, employee wages, and other expenses, their income is not enough. Farmers group Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG) agreed that there is a possibility that someone is taking advantage of the cost since there is enough pork supply. “Yung iba kasi, yung sinasabi nila yung mga producers daw may mataas pang pagkuha,” SINAG president Rodendo So said. (Some said the producers told them that they got the pork at a high price.) Aside from pork, DA also found the P150 per kilo price of garlic costly, so the agency is studying if it will impose an MSRP on imported garlic. —Mariel Celine Serquiña/RF, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Justice is investigating a fake memo regarding the transfer of 12 persons deprived of liberty from the Pasigui prison in Occidental Mindoro to the New Bilibid Prison. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said those behind the fake document falsified his signature. “Nagkaroon ng isang insidente na pamemeke ng isang papeles dito sa Bureau of Corrections kung saan maraming nagpalusot ng papel na napirmahan daw ng inyong lingkod na ililipat sa kanilang kinalalagyan ngayon pabalik sa Muntinlupa ang ilan sa mga PDLs na naroon ngayon sa Mindoro,” Remulla said. (There has been an incident in the Bureau of Corrections of falsification of a document which was allegedly signed by me ordering to transfer PDLs back to Muntinlupa from Mindoro.) Remulla said the Department of Justice discovered the fake document when BuCor chief Gregorio Catapang Jr. went to his office to validate the order. Remulla said the BuCor became suspicious of the order due to its barcode. He said the 12 concerned PDLs, who are currently detained at Pasagui Subprison Sablayan Detention Facility, were among the witnesses in the case of former Senator Leila de Lima. Remulla said the PDLs might have wanted to go back to the NBP to regain their positions in the “pecking order” among the inmates. He said these changes in positions might lead to trouble inside the jail facility. According to Remulla, BuCor, and DOJ employees might have been involved in the creation and distribution of the fake memo, which was forwarded to different offices in the department. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

During his Tuesday's meeting with Vuong Dinh Hue, chairman of the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, Marcos said this parliamentary cooperation would also help in enhancing the socio-economic development between the two nations. “[W]e have a wide variety of areas of cooperation that are under our strategic partnership, and in strengthening this, we recognize the important role of our parliamentary relations which provides us with a meaningful platform to discuss our policies in pursuit of a peaceful global community,” Marcos said. Marcos also highlighted the importance of open communication between the two nations in order to enrich parliamentary cooperation. “We certainly welcome the creation of the Philippines-Vietnam Friendship Parliamentary Group and recognize its fundamental role in maintaining an open communication where our countries could engage in policy dialogue and exchanges, so as to enrich our parliamentary cooperation,” Marcos said. “On cooperation between our political parties, I envision that the mandate of our political parties is to promote national security, enhance socio-economic development, and uplift the lives of our peoples,'' he added. Marcos had a two-day state visit in Hanoi, with the aim to enrich bilateral relations between the two countries. He arrived in Manila at 3:30 a.m. of Wednesday. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2025-02-21T13:48:00",
    "article_body": "The Board of Investments (BOI) has granted green lane status to Upgrade Energy Philippines Inc.’s (UGEP) two solar power projects, in Capiz and in Zambales, worth more than P3 billion. In a statement on Friday, the BOI said it awarded Green Lane Certificates of Endorsement to UGEP’s 56.771-megawatt Cabangan Solar Project in Zambales and the 47.001-MW Pontevedra Solar Power Project in Capiz with respective estimated project cost of P2.11 billion and P1.51 billion. Obtaining green lane status expedites permit and license issuance, including resolving strategic investment issues. In February last year, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. issued Executive Order 18 mandating the creation of green lanes as part of efforts for ease of doing business and promoting strategic investments. Strategic investments are those that are aligned with the Philippine Development Plan or any similar national development plan and can be characterized by the significant capital or investment to the country; consequential economic impact; positive impact on the environment; significant contribution to the country's balance of payments; with complex technical processes and engineering designs; and will improve the country's infrastructure capabilities. The BOI said the Philippines is bolstering its efforts to facilitate renewable energy projects through EO No. 18. The investment promotion agency said UGEP’s solar power projects are expected to generate up to 331 temporary and permanent direct job employment opportunities during the Projects’ construction and commissioning, followed by long-term roles in operations and maintenance over the 25-year project life. The projects will also support infrastructure development and community growth with the additional tax revenue and investment in local businesses, it said. “With the Board of Investment’s green lane facilitation, our projects will benefit from streamlined processing of permits and licenses, ensuring swift and efficient collaboration with national and local agencies. This endorsement not only validates our vision but also energizes our resolve to deliver a transformative renewable energy initiative that will power thousands of homes, reduce carbon emissions, and set a bold precedent for future green investments,” said UGEP president and CEO Ruth Yu-Owen. UGEP is a leading project development, engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) company specializing in renewable energy solutions. — BAP, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2024-10-27T15:19:00",
    "article_body": "Leptospirosis cases are expected to increase within the next two weeks following the severe floods caused by Severe Tropical Storm Kristine, the Department of Health (DOH) said Sunday. DOH spokesperson Assistant Secretary Albert Domingo said the numbers in leptospirosis data had already gone down prior to Kristine’s devastation, but it could jump again in the coming days as many people were exposed to floodwater. “In the next two weeks, nakabantay ang DOH kasi ina-anticipate natin na tataas ang mga kaso ng leptospirosis [dahil] sa dami ng mga nabaha hindi lang sa Bicol, [kundi] nationwide,” he said in a Super Radyo dzBB interview. (In the next two weeks, the DOH will be monitoring the situation as we anticipate the leptospirosis cases to increase due to the flooding not only in Bicol, but nationwide.) Domingo thus called on individuals who waded through floods to immediately go to health centers or consult with doctors in evacuation centers to know if they need to take antibiotics. Doxycycline is prescribed both as a prophylaxis and antibiotic against leptospirosis. “Meron tayong mga kapuso na sabihin nating mabilis lang ‘yung daan sa baha, baka naman hindi kailangan ng gamot o kaya kahit napalusong pero isang araw lang, isang bigayan lang ‘yung gamot,” he explained. (People who waded through the floods for only a short period of time might not need medicine or if they waded for only one day, the medicine might only be administered once.) “‘Pag sinabing high risk at ‘yun ‘yung mga nakatira sa lugar na talagang hindi pa bumaba ‘yung baha, binibigyan sila ng gamot. Ang protocol ay once a week, so pinapabalik-balik sila,” he added. (However, if they are high risk and live in areas where the flood has not yet receded, our protocol is that they need to take medicine once a week. So they need to return to health centers weekly.) Leptospirosis is a bacterial infection transmitted by animals such as rodents. Urine from infected rats could mix with floodwater during heavy rains, and could therefore enter the human body of people wading through floods. Its symptoms include fever, vomiting, nausea, muscle pain and headaches. The incubation period of leptospirosis may range from 2 to 30 days, usually showing symptoms around 1 to 2 weeks after exposure to contaminated flood waters.

    "article_body": "The hospital bills of National Artist for Film and Broadcast Arts Nora Aunor were shouldered by President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. and the Office of the President, a Presidential Communications Office (PCO) executive said Sunday. Analisa “Ana” Puod, PCO senior undersecretary for operations and strategic communications, confirmed this to reporters. “Hindi PCSO ang nag-shoulder. Ang OP at si Presidente,” Puod said. (The Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office did not shoulder Nora's hospital expenses; the Office of the President and Marcos did.) “‘Di lang 'yung hospital bill 'yan. Pati ibang utang at ibang expenses daw galing sa personal na pera ni PBBM 'yan,” she added. (It's not just the hospital bill. Even other debts and other expenses were paid for with the personal funds of the President.) She further explained the PCSO did not cover the hospital bills since the President and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos shouldered it along with other expenses. The amount was not disclosed, but Puod said Nora’s hospital expenses were paid under the hospitalization benefits for national artists. “Aside sa makukuha niya as National Artist nagbigay ng personal na pera yung mag asawa. Kasi nasa private hospital si Nora Aunor, malaki yung bill na di na kayang icover,” Puod said. (Aside from what she gets as a National Artist, the couple gave personal money. Because Nora Aunor was admitted to a private hospital, the bill was costly that they couldn't cover it anymore.) The amount was not disclosed, but Puod said Nora’s hospital expenses were paid under the hospitalization benefits for national artists. Earlier this week, Aunor was laid to rest at the Libingan ng mga Bayani in Taguig City. Aunor, whose real name is Nora Cabaltera Villamayor, passed away on April 16 due to acute respiratory failure . She was 71 years old. The \"Superstar\" and National Artist for Film and Broadcast Arts is best known for the films “Himala,” \"T-Bird at Ako,\" “Bulaklak sa City Jail,” and “The Flor Contemplacion Story,” among others.

For example, the major shareholders of the multilateral institutions is, are the US, World Bank, and ADB, the lending facility, especially for the official development assistance in those institutions is affected, then it can also be affected in the medium term, ano?''

The foreign aid pause which is effective immediately applies to both new and existing assistance, Reuters reported, citing the US State Department memo signed by Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday. In a separate statement, DFA spokesperson Teresita Daza said the agency would continue to engage with the US government on the matter, as the US Department of State and other relevant agencies are studying the executive order and its impact on US partnerships. . –NB, GMA Integrated News",

It was the fifth RORE (rotation and reprovisioning) mission completed for the Filipino troops stationed in the tank landing vessel, which has become the country's outpost to boost its claim to sovereignty over the area. \"The Philippines today completed another rotation and reprovisioning (RORE) mission to the BRP Sierra Madre in Ayungin Shoal and again no untoward incidents were reported,\" the DFA said in a statement. \"The [DFA] expresses thanks for the professionalism of the men and women of the Philippine Navy and the Philippine Coast Guard in the conduct of the mission,\" it added. In a separate statement, China's coast guard said it \"questioned\" and \"monitored\" the Philippine vessel throughout its supply mission, adding it would continue to carry out \"rights protection and law enforcement activities\" in the Spratly Islands and its surrounding waters. \"China hopes the Philippine side will honor its commitments, work together to manage maritime issues, and jointly maintain stability,\" the coast guard said. The DFA said the mission was conducted under the ambit of the understanding reached between the Philippines and China on \"principles and approaches for the conduct of RORE missions in Ayungin Shoal for the purpose of avoiding misunderstandings and miscalculations, without prejudice to national positions.\" \"It demonstrates that effective diplomacy plays a leading role in West Philippine Sea issues and creates pathways to innovative approaches that help manage the situation, without compromising the Philippine national interest,\" the DFA said. Earlier this month, Beijing and Manila held another round of talks to address their maritime disputes and agreed to seek common ground and find ways to cooperate. \"The Philippines views the latest RORE mission and the continued adherence to the understanding of the principles and approaches to such missions as substantial demonstrations of diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with issues in the South China Sea, and the country’s commitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes through dialogue and diplomacy, consistent with the guidance of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr.,\" the DFA said. China and the Philippines have traded barbs for months over maneuvers at Ayungin Shoal, an atoll within Manila's 200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. A 2016 ruling of an international arbitral tribunal said Beijing's claims, based on its historic maps, have no basis under international law, a decision China does not recognize. —Jiselle Anne Casucian/with a report from Reuters/LDF/VBL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Transportation (DOTr) on Tuesday said it will increase the equity subsidy for drivers of public utility vehicles (PUV) to P260,000 to allow them to purchase e-jeepneys for the PUV modernization program. The program currently provides a P160,000 equity subsidy for each driver who seeks to shift to a modern PUV unit, on top of the value of the old PUV. “Dahil patuloy ang pagtaas ng presyo ng mga produktong petrolyo, ang pagtaas ng presyo ng mga gastusin, itataas din ng Kagawaran ang equity subsidy na tinatawag to a maximum amount of P260,000,” DOTr Undersecretary Mark Steven Pastor said in GMA News’ Unang Balita interview. (Since the prices of petroleum products and commodities continue to increase, the Department will also increase the equity subsidy to a maximum amount of P260,000.) The DOTr aims to launch this increase in subsidy by the second quarter of 2023, he added. According to Pastor, a class 1 modern jeepney costs from P1.4 million to P1.8 million; a class 2 costsfrom P2 million to P2.6 million; while a class 3 costs P2.5 million to P3 million. Several transport groups are currently mounting a week-long strike in opposition to the PUV Modernization Program, which aims to replace traditional jeepneys with vehicles powered by more environment-friendly fuels. During the first day of the strike on Monday, transport group PISTON called on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to suspend the implementation of the guidelines for the program , saying they would stop the strike if the government responds to their concerns. As compared to Monday, Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) technical division head Joel Bolano said the situation for the second day of the strike is generally normal. However, he said the agency is still monitoring the situation and continues to provide free rides in Malabon, Navotas, Novaliches, Pasay, and Cubao going to Manila, as these areas became “critical” for passengers on Monday. “Doon sa monitoring ng aming personnel na nasa Metro Base ng MMDA at ‘yung mga team namin… so far, walang naka-report na stranded,” Bolano said in a separate Unang Balita interview. (There are no passengers stranded, based on the monitoring of our personnel from our team and from MMDA Metro Base.) The LTFRB extended the June 30 deadline for jeepney operators to form cooperatives to December 31, 2023. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Board of Investments (BOI) on Friday said it saw approved investment commitments grow by over a hundred percent in the first three months of 2023, bringing the agency closer to hitting its goal of P1.5 trillion investment pledges approved for the entire year. In a statement, the BOI said it booked P463.3 billion worth of total projects approved during the January to March period, up 155% from the P181.7-billion investment pledges seen in the same period last year. Of the total approved investment, P165.4 billion were from foreigners. Approved foreign investments grew by 3,722% from only P4.33 billion in the first quarter of 2022. Foreign investment commitments accounted for about 36% of the total. Meanwhile, domestic investment commitments took up the bulk of the total amounting to P297.9 billion, which grew by 68% from P177.3 billion year-on-year. Trade Secretary and BOI chairman Alfredo Pascual said that “with investment prospects being very positive, and as we continue to receive serious interest from global investors, we are definitely on track to meeting our new annual investment target of P1.5 trillion.” In terms of country origin, the bulk of the foreign capital came from Germany with P157 billion; followed by the Netherlands with P2.7 billion, the United States with P1.2 billion, Japan with P524 million, and the United Kingdom with P293 million. In terms of regional dispersion, investments in Western Visayas led the way with P293.3 billion, while CALABARZON took up second place with P112.7 billion. This is followed by Ilocos Region with P38.7 billion), Davao Region with P3.6 billion, and Eastern Visayas Region with P3.6 billion, completing the top five regions. The BOI said the renewable energy/power sector remains dominant with P440 billion in approvals to date, up 156% from P172 billion year-on-year. Manufacturing is also on the upswing with P17 billion in approvals, 416% higher from P3.3 billion in the same period last year. Administrative services with P3.7 billion, transportation and storage with P1.2 billion, and agriculture P929 million also make up the biggest sectors. Among the top projects approved for January to March 2023 is German-owned Wpd Philippines Inc.’s P392.4 billion offshore wind farms located in Cavite, Negros Occidental, and Guimaras, which will provide greener power solutions to local communities and businesses, according to the BOC. Filipino-owned 3 Barracuda Energy Corp. comes in second place with its P36.9 billion solar energy project located in the Ilocos Region. “The number of RE projects coming in is concrete evidence that we are on our way to becoming a global hub for sustainability and green projects, aligned with the national government’s policy of promoting cleaner and more sustainable sources of energy. We aim to attract more RE players globally as full foreign ownership is now allowed under the amended implementing rules and regulations of the Renewable Energy Act,” said Pascual. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

Teodoro said he would reiterate the policies and pronouncements of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. about security and defense matters during his engagements with various senior government officials, policymakers, scholars, and other dialogue participants. Teodoro will be meeting with his various counterparts and senior government officials at the sidelines of the defense summit where they will be engaging in discussions of strategic concerns among their countries. Marcos will deliver the keynote address on Friday, May 31.

The RFFA program is an unconditional financial assistance for small rice farmers tilling below two hectares. The cash grant is mandated under Republic Act (RA) No. 11598, or the Cash Assistance to Filipino Farmers Act of 2021, and overseen by the Department of Agriculture. The program is funded through the excess tariff collection from rice importations in 2022, totaling P12.7 billion. To recall, in September, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. approved the release of P12.7 billion in excess tariff collections to bankroll the RFFA program. As of December 28, the DA said 458,435 farmers' accounts have been credited with the cash aid. Meanwhile, the agency said 44,719 farmers have withdrawn their cash through the efforts of the Development Bank of the Philippines and remittance giant USSC, a BSP-licensed e-money issuer. The small rice farmers can use the cash they receive for daily subsistence and personal needs, said Agriculture Undersecretary for Rice Industry Development Leocadio Sebastian. –VAL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) is eyeing to file charges this week against individuals responsible for the excavation at the New Bilibid Prison (NBP), officer-in-charge Gregorio Catapang Jr. said Monday. “Pa-file na namin ‘yung kaso. Sabi namin sa DENR kayo mag file kasi kayo ang ano niyan. Hindi, sabi naman (nila), hindi BuCor na, so kami na lang magpa-file,” Catapang said in an ambush interview. Suspended BuCor chief Gerald Bantag previously admitted he was the one who ordered the excavation inside the NBP for a deep swimming pool because he is a “master scuba diver.” In December 2022, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources declared the excavation to be illegal quarrying . Previously asked if Bantag may face charges for the excavation, Catapang had said it is possible. He said they also plan to file charges against the Agua Tierra Oro Mina Development (ATOM) Corporation, the private entity Bantag entered a joint venture agreement with. “Yun pa, maypa-file kami na kaso doon. Kasi binigay na niya sa amin ‘yung mga ano eh, donation, tapos binawi niya,” Catapang said. (That’s one more. We will also file a case against them. Because they already gave us the donation and then they took it back.) “Kaya may 24 na tao na sinasabi ko, ‘yun ang mga involved. Sinoli ‘yung titulo ng lupa ng donation nang hindi ko alam. Ganon katindi ‘yung mga tao dito na talagang matitigas ‘yung ulo,” he added. (The 24 people I mentioned earlier are the ones involved. They returned the land title of the donation without my knowledge. That’s how hardheaded the people here are.) Catapang said they will also fill in the excavation site to avoid incidents. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla had said Bantag personally told him that he was digging for Yamashita treasure at the NBP, a claim Bantag denied. Meanwhile, Catapang said they are also hoping to file a plunder complaint against Bantag this week or early next week. He previously said this was because only around 60% of the prison cells being built by BuCor had been completed despite documents saying otherwise. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2022-11-20T12:28:00",
    "article_body": "Several groups on Sunday called on the government to build safer streets for children to prevent road-related accidents and deaths. During the unveiling of a mural marking the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims at the Children’s Road Safety Park in Manila, public interest law group ImagineLaw said that 1,670 children and youth are killed by road crashes every year in the country. “The government, in partnership with stakeholders, should continue improving road infrastructure, updating policies and enforcing traffic laws to make sure they are inclusive of children’s safety,” Atty. Daphne Marcelo, ImagineLaw’s project manager for road safety, said. “Playing outside or commuting to school should not be a death sentence for children,” she added. She stressed that the country’s road system should be designed to protect the lives of the most vulnerable road users like children and pedestrians. Hannah Estepa, a 15-year-old visually-impaired child-advocate from the Youth Alliance for Road Discipline, said that the ideal street for a child with disability is that with extra lanes and railings. In response, Transportation Undersecretary Mark Steven Pastor said that the government “will provide the necessary recognition and support to our victims of road crash,” citing Republic Act Number 11468 or the National Day of Remembrance for Road Crash Victims, Survivors, and Their Families Act. “It recognizes the crucial work of emergency services and also to raise awareness on road safety and promote evidence-based intervention to prevent road traffic deaths and injuries, among others,” he said. He committed that road safety would be their top priority and that the Department of Transportation (DOTr) Road Sector and its attached agencies will work on better and safer roads. “Kami sa Kagawaran ng Transportasyon ay gumagawa ng hakbang [we at the Department of Transportation are taking action]. We reaffirm our commitment that we will provide the support and necessary infrastructure so we will avoid the road crash incidents not only for children, but for everyone,” he added. For the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority’s (MMDA) part, acting chairperson Romando Artes apologized for the agency’s lapses, following a road accident involving their tow truck which resulted in the death of one person and injury of three others. “We will own up to our mistake. We will try to improve ‘yung aming serbisyo para hindi na maulit ‘yung ganitong pangyayari. Malungkot ako dahil nandito tayo sa isang event na supposedly para sa kaligtasan ng kalsada and yet, kami mismo, ang aming ahensiya ay nag-contribute sa pagkasawi ng isang tao,” he said. (We will own up to our mistake. We will try to improve our service so that this kind of incident does not happen again. I am sad because we are here at an event that is supposedly for road safety and yet, our agency itself contributed to the death of a person.) —KG, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The active mpox cases in the country are now at eight as three new cases were detected in the country, the Department of Health (DOH) said Sunday. The DOH said two of the additional cases were from Metro Manila, while the other one was from Calabarzon. All of them tested positive with MPXV clade II, which is a milder form of the mpox virus. The total mpox caseload in the Philippines now stood at 17 since July 2022. Nine of these cases have long recovered since 2023, while the eight remained to be active cases waiting for symptoms to resolve. Cases 15 and 16 had anonymous sexual encounters with more than one partner, while case 17 had close, skin-to-skin sexual contact with another person who had skin symptoms. The 15th case was a 29-year-old male from the National Capital Region (NCR) whose symptoms started last August 21. He had rashes, swollen neck lymph nodes, sore throat, muscle pain, and weakness. His fever also began a day after. This person did not travel within 21 days before the start of symptoms. He also reported one close contact, but engaged in anonymous sexual activities before symptom onset. As of the moment, this case remained in home isolation. Case 16, meanwhile, was a 34-year-old male also from NCR, whose symptoms started on August 27. He had rashes and blisters, and also had cough, fatigue, and swollen lymph nodes. He also had no travel history 21 days before his symptoms started, but had sexual contact with three individuals. Contact tracing is ongoing. The case is also currently completing his isolation at home after he was discharged from a health facility. Lastly, the 17th case was a 29-year-old male from Calabarzon who started having fever on August 19. Shortly after, he developed rashes or vesicles on his face, thorax, arms, legs, and soles, and also had headache, muscle pain, and swollen neck lymph nodes. He also had no travel history before the start of symptoms, but had close intimate contact with one sexual partner who may have had the same skin symptoms within the same period. This case reported two household close contacts. The DOH said that local government units where these three new cases were from were already informed of the situation. Common symptoms of mpox include a skin rash or mucosal lesions, which can last from two to four weeks. The rashes are accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy, and swollen lymph nodes. Anyone can get mpox, according to DOH, and the virus can be transmitted to humans through close and intimate contact with someone who is infectious, through contaminated materials like used clothes or utensils, or through infected animals. The public were thus advised to use soap and water to kill the virus, and to use gloves when washing contaminated materials. READ : New guidelines vs mpox Aside from releasing the updated interim guidelines for the prevention, detection, and management of mpox in the Philippines, the DOH said that passengers going in and out of the country are now required to declare if they have had rashes , vesicles, or blisters in the past 30 days prior to their travel as part of the mpox surveillance. If a traveler arriving in the Philippines was determined to be coming from a country listed by World Health Organization (WHO) as an outbreak area, has a history of exposure to an mpox case, or has any mpox signs or symptoms, the eTravel system will alert the Bureau of Quarantine and the Bureau of Immigration. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "LA CARLOTA CITY –President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Friday said he wanted long-term measures to address the displacement of families who are affected by the activity of Kanlaon Volcano. Marcos remarked after he met local officials to discuss the recent situation amid the Kanlaon Volcano's recent eruptions. \"Ano ‘yung pangangailangan? Kung mayroon pang kulang dito sa support na ibinibigay natin sa mga evacuees at saka ‘yung mga na-displace, ‘yung wala sa evacuation center pero wala sa bahay nila,'' Marcos told reporters. ''So, tuloy-tuloy lang naman ‘yun, that will be continued. Pero now ang mahabang diskusyon is ‘yung long term, paano natin gagawin,'' he added. (What do they need? What support do they still need for the evacuees and the displaced–those who are already out of the evacuation centers but have no more homes to go to?) Canlaon City, Negros Oriental Mayor Jose Chubasco Cardenas said there should be sufficient funds if a permanent evacuation center will be built for the residents. ''I think for the 2,400 families and 8,000 individuals it reaches up to P400 to P500 million,'' Cardenas said. Marcos said a permanent evacuation center outside the danger zone to cater to those affected by Kanlaon's volcanic activities was being considered. Kanlaon Volcano remains under Alert Level 3, meaning evacuation from the six-kilometer radius of the volcano’s summit has been recommended. In its latest advisory, PHIVOLCS said ten volcanic earthquakes have been recorded as of February 21. The volcano edifice is inflated, the agency added. Possible hazards include sudden explosive eruption, lava flow or effusion, ashfall, pyroclastic density current, rockfall, and lahars during heavy rains. Negros Occidental Vice Governor Jeffrey Ferrer said Friday that a good portion of the Quick Response Fund had been used because of the Kanlaon Volcano. Ferrer said 70 percent of the QRF had been used and he had already asked the Department of the Interior and Local Government if the developmental fund could be used in case the volcano's restiveness continued. Marcos said QRF would be provided for the affected localities. –NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Gatchalian urges review of proposed new senior high curriculum reducing programs, offering electives on demand A comprehensive review of the proposed reduction of senior high school (SHS) tracks and offering electives on demand should be done as soon as possible to ensure a seamless transition between basic and higher education, Senate Committee on Basic Education chairperson Shewin Gatchalian said Thursday. Gatchalian, who is part of the Second Committee on Education the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM 2) which evaluates the performance of the Philippine education sector, said the review is crucial given that the new SHS curriculums set to be implemented in selected public and private schools beginning School Year 2025–2026 features a major restructuring of the program: reducing Senior High School tracks from four to two — Academic and Technical-Professional tracks, as well as cutting down the number of core subjects from 15 to a more focused set of five core subjects. Likewise, the new SHS curriculum will allow students to select from a number of electives to pursue their career interests, to decongest learning content and to provide clearer, more practical exit pathways for students whether they pursue college or enter the workforce. Gatchalian, however, expressed doubts that the new curriculum will indeed eliminate the need for bridging programs once students reach higher education. Likewise, the senator said the feasibility of the new curriculum in light of the challenges surrounding SHS implementation since 2016 is also not guaranteed. “My question to DepEd is: aren’t we going into the same problem [as the current curriculum] with the electives? Because while the electives and TechPro look good on paper, implementation is a different scenario”, Gatchalian said. “We must think not only of the intended curriculum, but of the implemented curriculum, because everything we are discussing today will depend on the capacity of our schools to implement it on the ground.” The lawmaker argued that even if students take the electives, they may still not be college-ready because of schools’ resource limitations. “The revised curriculum must be designed to ensure that students, regardless of school capacity or elective availability, can meet the minimum standards for college readiness. At the end of the day, what’s important is they are college-ready. It should be designed in a way that whatever electives they take, they will be ready for higher education,” Gatchalian said. “In small schools, they might not be able to offer all the electives for the Academic track, and that then affects their college readiness,” he added. During the recent Senate basic education committee hearing on the results of the 2024 functional literacy, education and mass media survey (FLEMMS), it was revealed that over 18 million junior high school graduates are considered “functional illiterate” or those who have problems in comprehension and understanding. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

According to the PCG, photos from its Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) flight confirmed the continued presence of 26 suspected Chinese maritime militia and Chinese Coast Guard within the country’s maritime domain. The Ayungin Shoal is located some 100 nautical miles off Palawan but is likewise near Mischief Reef, an area in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) reportedly occupied by China. The PCG said they ordered China Coast Guard 5304 to leave the area in response to a Chinese and English radio challenge from the Chinese ship, highlighting that the MDA is being conducted over the Philippine Exclusive Economic Zone. In a separate statement, the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea (NTF-WPS) said the PCG's Cessna Caravan 2081 flew over Ayungin and Sabina Shoals to observe and conduct radio challenges to Chinese coast guard vessels on Tuesday, February 21. The PCG plane approached 10 nautical miles off Ayungin Shoal and issued a radio challenge over China Coast Guard 5304 to leave the area immediately. However, the Chinese vessel issued an “unclear” radio challenge and maintained its presence in shoal, according to the NTF-WPS. The NTF-WPS said China Coast Guard 5304 maintained a constant close distance of not more than one nautical mile from BRP Sierra Madre. The PCG aircraft also noticed at least four Chinese militia vessels anchored inside the Ayungin Shoal, it said. The PCG pilots relayed the patrol data and observations to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) personnel stationed onboard BRP Sierra Madre (LS-57) at Ayungin Shoal. The NTF-WPS, citing the data of the PCG, said the Chinese coast guard vessel 5205 that pointed the “military-grade” laser light at the BRP Malapascua departed the Kalayaan Island Group en route to Hainan, China. Some members of the PCG had suffered temporary blindness due to the laser. Chinese Ambassador Huang Xilian, however, said both the Philippine and Chinese sides should refrain from taking any provocative action in the disputed waters. The Department of Foreign Affairs, Manila, meanwhile, lodged a diplomatic protest against China on the incident. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

Meanwhile, the remaining P200 million will be for the construction of four units of five-storey, low-rise residential buildings in Region VI, which will be the resettlement for informal settler families. “Housing remains a priority for President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. as he strongly believes in the necessity of providing decent homes for Filipinos, particularly those adversely affected by calamities,” said Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman. The Budget Department said the request for payments, chargeable to previous years’ released allotments, was supported with a documented list of Special Allotment Release Orders (SAROs) with their respective amounts, status of fund utilization, and finance accountability reports “all of which the DBM confirmed to be in order.” The NHA is the sole national agency mandated to engage in housing production for low-income families. Under the administrative supervision of the Department of Human Settlement and Urban Development (DHSUD), the NHA functions as a production and financing arm in housing. — Ted Cordero/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

Alam naman natin na mahalaga na isambulat natin ang katotohanan sa taumbayan,” Remulla said in an ambush interview. (Whoever they may be. We know that it is important to reveal the truth to the public.) When prompted if this included former President Rodrigo Duterte, Remulla answered that there will be no sacred cows in the investigation. “Basta wala tayong sinasanto. Ang mahalaga, kung meron, kung nagkasala ka sa lipunan ay pagbayaran mo. ‘Yun lang naman yun eh. it’s crime and punishment,” he said. (There will be no sacred cows here. What is important is if you commit a crime you should be held accountable for it. That’s all. It’s crime and punishment.) The Justice Secretary stressed that authorities will not let go of cold cases. He called on individuals who may be willing to testify and give evidence to coordinate with the DOJ. “Kasi walang katahimikan hanggang walang hustisya. I really think that people’s peace of mind about attaining justice is the most important thing in our society,” he said. (There will be no peace until we obtain justice. I really think that people’s peace of mind about attaining justice is the most important thing in our society.) Earlier in the day, Philippine National Police-Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (PNP-CIDG) acting director Police Brigadier General Nicolas Torre III said that the CIDG will file charges against anyone, including Duterte, if warranted. For their part, former presidential chief legal counsel Salvador Panelo denied that there were EJKs during the previous administratino. He said Torre knew that there were supposedly no EJKs as he had been a police officer for a long time. \"Those casualties either resisted or put at risk the lives of the law enforcement agencies. Others were the result of the internecine war between drug syndicates,\" Panelo said in a statement. \"If there was evidence on extrajudicial killings on the part of the police operatives, Torre would have already filed the cases against the errant cops during his sting in the previous administration,\" he added. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

PNP spokesperson Police Brigadier General Jean Fajardo said that no untoward incidents were reported since supporters of the Duterte family have started flocking at EDSA Shrine on Tuesday, November 26. “As of 7 a.m. this morning po ay tahimik naman po doon sa paligid ng [it was quiet around the] EDSA Shrine,” Fajardo said in a Super Radyo dzBB interview. “Meron tayong mga around 200 na nagbabantay diyan pero doon sa mga nagra-rally ay mga nasa 20 na lamang ‘yung naiiwan do’n. Bagamat maliit na bilang ay binabantayan pa rin natin sila,” she added. (We have around 200 personnel monitoring there, but among the rallyists, only around 20 were left. Although this is a small number, we are still keeping an eye on them.) Some supporters earlier conducted a program until 1 a.m. to show support for Vice President Sara Duterte and former president Rodrigo Duterte. They said they wanted to allot a day in which they can express themselves in relation to the recent events in the country. The PNP, in return, said it would interfere with the gathering of crowds at the shrine if traffic would be already affected. The police also released a video showing that some supporters were offered money in exchange for their presence at the EDSA Shrine. The allegations were refuted by some supporters. The EDSA Shrine was established in December 1989 as a dedication to Mary, Queen of Peace who was believed to have played a part in the peaceful and bloodless People Power Revolution that ousted former President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. in 1986. It was referred to as “Holy Ground” after another peaceful edition of People Power took place in EDSA in January 2001. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

This came after PAGASA said that moderate to heavy rains (50 to 100mm) may prevail over Bicol and 11 other areas. In its 5 p.m. tropical cyclone bulletin, PAGASA said Tropical Depression Querubin weakened into a low-pressure area. However, in its forecast, the state weather bureau said the shear line will bring cloudy skies with scattered rains and thunderstorms over the Bicol region and four other areas, raising the risk of flash floods and landslides due to moderate to heavy rainfall. “We are on constant alert regarding the lahar situation around Mayon Volcano. Experts warn that lahar deposits from previous eruptions can be mobilized when rainfall reaches 60mm per hour,” OCD Bicol director Claudio Yucot said in a statement on Wednesday afternoon. The OCD also said evacuations will be implemented once the rainfall reaches the threshold of 40-50mm per hour. Earlier today, PHIVOLCS warned of possible lahar flow as moderate to heavy rainfall is seen over the Bicol Region and Negros Island in the coming days. “This can generate volcanic sediment flows or lahars, muddy streamflows or muddy run-off in rivers and drainage areas on the monitored active volcano,” PHIVOLCS said in an advisory. “DOST-PHIVOLCS thus strongly recommends increased vigilance and readiness of communities in pre-determined zones of lahar and related hazards on these volcanoes,” it added. Mayon Volcano remains at Alert Level 1, which means there is no eruption in the foreseeable future. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Land Bank of the Philippines on Tuesday said its loans to the agriculture sector reached P257.7 billion as of the first half of 2022. In a statement, Lanbank said loans to the agriculture sector released during the period grew 15.5% year-on-year, solidifying its position as the biggest lender to the agriculture sector in the country. \"Landbank stands ready to extend accessible credit to all agri players to boost the country’s food production and supply. We will continue ramping up our lending activities in full support of the new administration’s agricultural modernization agenda,\" said Landbank president and CEO Cecilia Borromeo. Of the P257.7 billion total outstanding loans, Landbank said P37.5 billion went to small farmers and fishers, including those which were channeled through cooperatives and farmers’ associations, rural financial institutions, and other conduits. A total of P163.1 billion was used to support small, medium, and large agribusiness enterprises, while the remaining P57 billion went to agri-aqua related projects of local government units (LGUs) and government-owned and controlled corporations (GOCCs). The loans were used to finance various economic activities, including P56.7 billion for livestock, crops, and fisheries production, and P122.2 billion for agri-processing and trading of rice, corn, and sugarcane, among others. A total of P78.8 billion was utilized for the construction and improvement of essential agricultural infrastructure such as public markets, farm-to-market roads, warehouses, cold storages, irrigation systems, and slaughterhouses. In the first six months of 2022, Landbank said it also assisted in the construction and improvement of 138 kilometers of farm-to-market roads—which is one of the priorities in President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s development plan for the agriculture sector. In support of the President’s long-term goal to modernize agricultural production, the state-owned lender said it has been offering the Agri-Mechanization Financing Program designed to promote mechanization of production and post-production processes, from planting to harvesting and processing, thereby increasing efficiency, reducing post-harvest losses and lowering production costs. Landbank said its Agri-Mechanization Financing Program has supported 53 micro and small enterprises and cooperatives with cumulative loan releases totaling P681.5 million as of end-June 2022. The bank, likewise, said that it has cumulatively assisted more than 3.3 million farmers and fishers nationwide, of which 566,462 or 17% came from the 20 poorest provinces in the country. The top provinces with the highest number of beneficiaries are Nueva Ecija, Maguindanao, Bohol, Pangasinan, Cotabato, Isabela, Cagayan, Leyte, Ilocos Sur, and South Cotabato. The bank said that its close collaboration with the Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) has also allowed it to reach and serve more farmers and fishers. Landbank said it has extended a total of P13.3 billion to 247,591 borrowers under the programs it is administering for DA, and another P719.4 million to more than 200 agrarian reform beneficiary (ARB) organizations, benefiting over 11,000 ARBs and small farm holders under DAR’s programs. — VBL, GMA News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on Monday said they are considering implementing an offsite payout system for indigent students who could not register online for the agency’s educational assistance program due to lack of access to internet or gadgets. DSWD spokesperson Assistant Secretary Romel Lopez said they will allot specific guidelines for the house-to-house distribution of the cash aid, possibly in coordination with the local government units. “When it comes to those who don’t have access to internet, to gadgets, we will come up with guidelines, most probably offsite payouts. Remember during the pandemic, the DSWD social workers, nag-bahay bahay na,” Lopez said in an ANC interview. Aside from this, Lopez said the DSWD, with the help of the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), is also planning to add more payout centers in cities and municipalities to serve more students in crisis situations. “Last Saturday when DILG Secretary Benhur Abalos visited one of our payout areas, he promised us that he will be talking to more local government units to cater and help us with our educational assistance. Our possible agenda will be to really increase the number of our payout centers to better help our kababayans,” he added. He said the DSWD has enough social workers to assess in more payout centers and that the LGUs also committed their social welfare officers to conduct initial screenings. As of Monday, Lopez noted that about P376.5 million educational assistance have been provided to some 148,000 students nationwide in the past two Saturdays. Under its cash assistance program for indigent students, the DSWD is distributing P1,000 for elementary students, P2,000 for high school students, P3,000 for senior high school students, and P4,000 for college students or vocational courses. The DSWD has earmarked P1.5 billion for this initiative, expected to cater to up to 400,000 students all over the country. — Giselle Ombay/RSJ, GMA News",

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. has doubled the cash rewards given to double Olympic gold medalist Carlos Yulo and bronze medalists Aira Villegas and Nesthy Petecio following their success in the 2024 Paris Olympics. The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) on Wednesday confirmed that Marcos gave Yulo P20 million in cash on top of what is mandated by law. He also gave the double-gold winning gymnast a Presidential Medal of Merit. Marcos also extended another P2 million each to Villegas and Petecio. ''It's on top of what is legally mandated,'' the PCO said. ''It's the President’s recognition of their hard work and dedication that brought so much joy and pride to the entire nation.'' Under Republic Act 10699 or the National Athletes and Coaches Benefits and Incentives Act, an athlete who wins a gold medal in the Olympics is entitled to a P10-million incentive; an Olympic silver, P5 million; and bronze, P2 million. With his two golds from the floor exercise and vault events, Yulo under the law is entitled to incentives worth P20 million. Bronze-medal winning boxers Petecio and Villegas are entitled under the law to P2 million each. Marcos further extended P1 million each to the rest of the Olympians and P500,000 each to their coaching teams. In his speech during the awarding ceremony on Tuesday night, Marcos acknowledged the hard work and sacrifices of the athletes. He emphasized that the athletes have shown the excellence of the Filipino spirit during the Paris Olympics. The President said their performances and success meant a lot to every Filipino who cheered for them during their competitions. The Philippines wrapped up the 33rd Summer Games at the 37th spot, the best among Southeast Asian countries. — RSJ/VBL/NB, GMA Integrated News",

The total volume of production loss was thus at 728 metric tons (MT), affecting 198 hectares of agricultural lands, it added. A total of 684 farmers were affected, the DA said. The department said its personnel from the regional field are conducting assessment of the damage and losses due to the Habagat in the agri-fisheries sector. \"The DA continuously coordinates with concerned NGAs, LGUs and other DRRM-related offices for the impact of the \"Habagat\", as well as available resources for interventions and assistance,\" it said.

    "article_body": "The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Thursday said more than P860 million has been disbursed for the distribution of fuel subsidies to public transportation drivers and operators. In a news release, the LTFRB said a total of P860,977,500 has been disbursed by the agency to the Land Bank of the Philippines, covering funding requirements to distribute the subsidies of public utility vehicles (PUV) stakeholders. The public land transportation regulator said the number of PUV operators included to the list of beneficiaries of the government’s Fuel Subsidy Program reached 132,009 nationwide as of October 3. The said list was endorsed to the Landbank for the crediting of fuel subsidies. Meanwhile, 92,755 units of PUVs have already received their fuel subsidies. The total amount credited so far stood at P605,186,000. Under the fuel subsidy program, modernized PUV operators and drivers shall receive P10,000, while those operating traditional PUVs shall receive P6,500. Moreover, delivery riders and tricycle drivers will also receive P1,200 and P1,000, respectively, under the fuel subsidy program. The government began the distribution of cash aid to PUV stakeholders last month. The Department of Transportation (DOTr) and the LTFRB estimate some 1.36 million operators will receive the subsidies — 280,000 PUVs, 930,000 tricycles, and 150,000 delivery service riders. The activation of the Fuel Subsidy Program was triggered by the consecutive hikes in the pump prices of petroleum products. Amid the rising fuel costs, the LTFRB on Tuesday approved a P1 provisional increase in the minimum fare for public utility jeepneys (PUJs) effective Sunday, October 8. Meanwhile, the LTFRB is yet to decide on the petition seeking the P5 increase in the minimum fare for PUJs. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

Speaking to Palace reporters, Marcos guaranteed that those who would be implicated in assisting Guo would surely \"pay the price.\" \"All of those who are implicated in assisting Alice Guo to leave the Philippines illegally as a fugitive from justice will certainly pay the price,\" Marcos said. \"Ang tanong niyo, sino sisibakin? Hindi lang namin sila sisibakin, kakasuhan pa namin sila dahil ang kanilang ginawa ay labag sa batas at against all of the interests of the Philippine judicial system,\" he added.

When asked who are these personnel, Marcos said, \"You'll find out soon enough.\" Marcos said the government is already finalizing the arrangements to bring Guo back to the Philippines ''sometime today.'' ''They're implementing the legal orders that were sent to them by the court and that is to bring back the fugitive Alice Guo to the Philippines. So, that is what they are doing,'' he said. The President said last month that \" heads will roll \" as a result of Guo's departure, adding that an investigation into the matter was already underway. Marcos later said he has \" a very, very good idea \" whose head would roll following the probe. Guo was arrested in Indonesia early Wednesday morning , according to the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC). Citing information from the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI), Senator Sherwin Gatchalian said Guo was under the custody of the Indonesian police following her arrest in Tangerang City, Indonesia. In a video message also on Wednesday, Marcos said Guo's arrest should serve as a warning to those attempting to evade justice in the Philippines. \"Such is an exercise in futility,\" Marcos said, adding that, \"The arm of the law is long and it will reach you.\" Guo, whose real name is Guo Hua Ping according to Philippine authorities, is facing a number of legal troubles , including alleged involvement in the operations of an illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) in Bamban. — VDV/VBL, GMA Integrated News",

Recalling his conversation with Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, Herbosa said that there will no longer be an allocated budget for the HEA under the 2025 National Expenditure Program (NEP) as the unpaid allowance may already be released in 2024. “Sabi ni Secretary Pangandaman, wala na do’n ‘yung budget ng allowance. Sabi ko, bakit wala? ‘Mukhang kaya na namin ibigay this year,’” he said in a pre-SONA special interview on state-run PTV. (Secretary Pangandaman said that there will be no budget for the allowance next year. I asked why. She said that they may already release it this year.) “This year, oo, mukhang maibibigay na ng national government ‘yung remaining P27 billion pa ‘yun eh na hindi pa namin na-allocate para mabayaran na lahat. ‘Yun ang good news,” he added. (This year, the national government might be able to distribute the remaining P27 billion that we haven’t allocated yet, so we could pay everyone. That’s the good news.) Meanwhile, DOH spokesperson Assistant Secretary Albert Domingo affirmed what Herbosa said, noting that the DOH requested the DBM if the HEA may be paid earlier or by this year. “[The] DBM gave an assurance that the earlier timeline is possible and that they are looking for the fund source,” Domingo told GMA News Online. Back in May, Pangandaman said that the DBM targeted to settle all the remaining P27.7 billion arrears for the HEA by the end of 2025. She said the first step involves utilizing a P2.3-billion unprogrammed appropriations fund contingent upon the collection of excess revenue. The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) announced Tuesday that President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. already approved the proposed 2025 NEP , amounting to P6.352 trillion. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

Rodolfo, and Strategic Trade Management Office (STMO) Director Janice Sacedon-Dimayacyac led the signing of the memorandum of agreement (MOA) on Monday. According to Rubio, the agreement is part of the government’s bid to strengthen the implementation of Republic Act No. 10697 or the Strategic Trade Management Act (STMA). It also signifies the country’s commitment to establishing robust and effective strategic trade controls, in line with the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolution No. 1540. The resolution urges UN Member States to enforce measures and establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and their means of delivery through strategic trade management. Rubio also said the MOA includes provisions for capacity-building support for the BOC to enhance its knowledge of strategic goods and foster enhanced cooperation between the BOC and STMO. Further, the agreement aligns with the core mandates of the BOC and “paves the way for a future in which strategic trade control processes expedite clearances, reduce transaction time and costs, and maintain effective levels of strategic trade control.\" The STMA defines strategic goods as \"products that, for security reasons or due to international agreements, are considered to be of such military importance that their export is either prohibited altogether or subject to specific conditions.\" They are classified as either military goods, dual use goods or nationally controlled goods. Under the law, the Philippines committed to be free of weapons of mass destruction “consistent with the national interest, to fulfill its international commitments and obligations” including UNSC Resolution 1540, which urges member-states to enforce measures and establish domestic controls to prevent the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons and their means of delivery through strategic trade management. —Sundy Locus/LDF, GMA Integrated News",

Herbosa said medical professionals \"are expected to uphold professional and ethical standards.\" \"Societal pressures, financial gains, and administrative exigencies shall not compromise the rights of the patient to quality healthcare services,\" he added. The DOH chief issued the statement amid recent reports of drug firms allegedly giving privileges to medical professionals and using multi-level marketing schemes to entice them to advertise and prescribe medical products. In a Senate hearing early this month, Senator Raffy Tulfo said that some doctors prefer to prescribe branded medicine over generic ones allegedly due to trips sponsored by the pharmaceutical firms. Herbosa explained that while there is an existing executive order on the use of generic drugs in public hospitals, there are cases when the generic medicines are \"not clinically effective.\" While he acknowledged that there were \" junkets \" before, he said that the Philippines has become a signatory to the Mexico City Principles which provide voluntary codes of business ethics in the biopharmaceutical sector. —LDF, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Vice President Sara Duterte will not appear before the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on Friday to explain her remark that she ordered someone to kill President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. if an assassination plot against her succeeds. “Hindi po siya makakarating (She will not able to come) today,” Atty. Paul Lim, Duterte’s legal counsel, said in a video by GMA Integrated News' Ian Cruz. Lim declined to elaborate when asked on why the Vice President could not attend the day's investigation. The NBI issued a subpoena to Duterte to allow her to explain her alleged kill order against the President, First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos, and Speaker Martin Romualdez if she dies. She is being investigated for alleged grave threats in relation to the Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 and possible violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020. She had earlier contended that her remarks against the First Couple and Romualdez were “maliciously taken out of logical context.” Duterte previously said she will ask the NBI to reschedule her summon as she will prioritize her attendance at the House good government panel's inquiry into the budget use of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the Department of Education when it was still under her. The House committee, however, postponed its hearing scheduled on Friday morning to give way to the NBI probe. In a press conference, NBI director Jaime Santiago said Lim handed them a letter from Duterte requesting for a new date for her appearance. \"The Vice President ay late na niya nalaman na cancelled ang kanyang appearance before the House committee hearing. So hindi na siya nakapunta dito and asked for a resetting,\" he said. (She found out late that her appearance before the House Committee hearing was cancelled so she could no longer appear here and asked for a reset.) In the letter, Duterte requested the NBI for a clear copy of the complaint and other documents that initiated the investigation, as well as the list of questions that the NBI intends to ask her. Santiago said the NBI will comply with some of Duterte's requests. \"We will comply with her request dahil sa due process. Out of respect dahil siya ay pangalawang pinakamataas na official ng ating bayan, we will comply with her request,” he said. (We will comply with her request because of due process. Out of respect because she is the second highest official in the country, we will comply with her request.) When asked if the NBI will provide Duterte with their questions, he said they would still have to discuss this. According to Santiago, the NBI hearing will be rescheduled to December 11 to give Duterte time to prepare. Santiago said Duterte could choose to appear at an earlier date. \"Kung magpapasabi siya akin, no, I will not wait for December 11, I want to talk to you now, mas maganda po,\" he said. (If she will reach out and tell me that she will not wait for December 11 and that she wants to talk to me now, then all the better.) Asked what action the NBI will take should Duterte fail to appear again on December 11, Santiago said they would cross the bridge when they get there. The NBI chief also said he felt a \"little frustration\" that Duterte, who he said is not immune from suit, failed to appear on Friday as he was hoping to put an end to the issue. He also assured the public that the situation is under control. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

Duterte is currently facing two impeachment complaints , the first of which was filed by advocacy groups on the grounds of alleged corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust, and other high crimes. This was endorsed by Akbayan Party-list Rep. Perci Cendaña. The second impeachment complaint was filed by more than 70 representatives from various sectors, anchored on alleged betrayal of public trust in connection with alleged misuse of confidential funds. It was endorsed by the progressive Makabayan bloc. The Vice President has yet to comment regarding the recent impeachment moves against her, but she has so far thanked people, including healthcare workers and senators, who aided her office amid the recent \"crisis.\" \"Nagpapasalamat ang Tanggapan ng Pangalawang Pangulo sa lahat ng mga tumulong, sumuporta, at nagpaabot ng pakikiisa at pagdamay sa opisina nang humarap ito sa krisis at kagipitan kamakailan,\" the Office of the Vice President’s statement read.

''My take is medicine is an innovation, we cannot guarantee na ito lang po tayo at darating sa future eh wala na, hanggang dito na lang,'' Zacate said at a Palace press briefing. ''My take on marijuana is that I am open, basically, Filipinos must have a wide range of therapeutic indication, drug of choice so ako po ay for the record, to the Food and Drug Administration, as the director general is very much open for the marijuana as long as this has been streamlined as long as di makakasama sa ating mga kababayan,'' he added. Zacate noted that the proposed bill on medical use of marijuana is subject to the wisdom of the legislative branch of government. Earlier, the joint House committees on dangerous drugs and health approved an unnumbered substitute bill allowing the use of cannabis or marijuana for medical use. Surigao del Norte Representative Robert Ace Barbers, chairman of the dangerous drugs panel, said the measure only allows for the medical use of cannabis and as such it will still be listed as an illegal drug as provided in the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act or Republic Act 9165. \"This [proposed] law only grants an exception to the enumeration of prohibited drugs under RA 9165 by limiting it for medical use. Cannabis in pharmaceutical form is allowed, provided that you have a prescription,\" he said. \"Also, the law has limitations, as the accredited physician is only allowed to prescribe what is allowable for the illness,\" he added. The Department of Health currently allows the medical use of cannabis under a compassionate special permit. Once the proposed bill becomes a law, the lawmaker said that the issuance of a CSP will no longer be needed. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

The Export-Import Bank of Korea (KEXIM) will provide a $905.26 million official development assistance (ODA) loan for the Laguna Lakeshore Road Network (LLRN) Project Phase 1 Stage 1, the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) announced on Saturday. This funding will support the implementation of civil works for the LLRN Phase 1 Stage 1, a flagship initiative under the Marcos administration’s Build Better More program. A ceremonial exchange of the loan agreement took place on Friday, January 17, 2025, at the Department of Finance (DOF) office in Manila. The event was attended by KEXIM Executive Director Um Sung-Yong, Public Works Secretary Manuel Bonoan, Korea’s Ministry of Economy and Finance (MOEF) First Vice Minister Kim Beom-Seok, and DOF Undersecretary Joven Balbosa. The project’s Phase 1 Stage 1 will span a 7.94-kilometer road, including 6.81 kilometers of viaduct/bridge, 1.13 kilometers of embankment, three interchanges, and 1.92 kilometers of slip roads. Civil works are scheduled to begin in fiscal year 2025, with completion targeted for 2029. Once completed, the project is expected to boost economic productivity and drive positive development in the Calabarzon Region and the broader National Capital Region. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Tuesday said it has monitored a total of 203 Chinese vessels in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) in the past week, the highest number for this year. “This is the highest we have recorded in the vicinity of our nine occupied features in WPS for this year. While it is not normal, it is within the range of the capability they could project in the SCS/WPS,” Philippine Navy spokesperson for WPS Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinindad told reporters. From August 27 to September 2, a total of 165 Chinese maritime militia (CMM) vessels, 24 China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, 12 People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) ships, and two research vessels were seen in the area. These Chinese vessels were seen in the following WPS features: Most Chinese vessels were spotted in Escoda Shoal, where recent aggressive actions by China were reported. “We can attribute the surge to the attention given to Sabina/Escoda Shoal in the last few weeks. Nevertheless, the increase in numbers will not justify their illegal presence, their coercive and aggressive actions and their deceptive narratives,” Trinidad said. “The Philippine Navy - and the AFP - will continue to perform its mandate to protect our territory as we uphold international law and contribute to regional peace and stability. As to their plans, I do not want to speculate but rest assured we have contingencies in place as we continue to protect our territory,” he added. On Saturday, the Philippine government reported that a CCG vessel \"intentionally\" and repeatedly rammed the Philippine Coast Guard’s (PCG) BRP Teresa Magbanua in Escoda Shoal. On August 26, CCG ships blocked two PCG vessels on a rotation and reprovisioning mission to the BRP Teresa Magbanua in Escoda Shoal. On August 25, CCG vessels rammed and used a water cannon on the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources' BRP Datu Sanday near Escoda Shoal. On August 19, CCG vessels also had collisions with PCG vessels near Escoda while the latter were on their way to deliver supplies to Patag and Lawak Islands. More incidents involving China and the Philippines were reported in other WPS features in the past weeks. The Philippine government is contemplating on whether to lodge another arbitral case against China over the latest incident in Escoda Shoal where a CCG vessel 'intentionally' rammed BRP Teresa Magbanua, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said on Monday. Tensions continue amid China’s massive claim in the South China Sea (SCS), including the portion the Philippines refers to as the West Philippine Sea. The SCS is a conduit for more than $3 trillion in annual ship commerce. Aside from the Philippines, China has overlapping claims in the area with Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Brunei. In 2016, an international arbitration tribunal in Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines over China's claims in the South China Sea, saying that it had \"no legal basis.\" China has not recognized the decision. —Joviland Rita/KG, GMA Integrated News",

In a statement on Thursday, the DOTr said Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista directed the Office of Transportation Security (OTS) to immediately file charges against security screening personnel tagged in the September 8 incident at Terminal 1 of NAIA. The DOTr said Bautista directed Transportation Undersecretary for Legal Atty. Reinier Yebra to assist in filing the complaints against those found to have connived in stealing from the handcarried bag of a Chinese passenger. The Transportation chief also authorized imposing the maximum penalty to those who will be found guilty to show the department's effort to rid NAIA as well as other attached agencies of scalawags, according to the DOTr. According to earlier reports, three OTS personnel were being investigated after a CCTV footage showed a female personnel putting something in her mouth and then drinking water. OTS officials conducted an inspection on all personnel after a passenger complained that his $300 in cash was missing. Upon checking the CCTV footage, they saw a 28-year-old contractual employee swallowing an object. Officials are now investigating whether the item was the missing cash. Bautista expressed frustration and dismay over the incident at NAIA, which he was trying to promote to potential foreign investors who may want to operate and maintain the country's main gateway. The OTS is coordinating with the PNP Aviation Security Group for the filing of criminal raps and assisting the complainant if he decides to pursue the case. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Farm industry stakeholders on Wednesday lauded President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s decision to lift the mandated price ceilings on two varieties of rice commonly purchased by households. In a statement, Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG) executive director Jayson Cainglet said, “We thank the President for the lifting of the price ceiling.” “The imposition and lifting [today] of the price cap has been supported by the agriculture sector,” he added. Marcos, on Wednesday morning, announced the lifting of Executive Order 39 , which mandated a price cap of P41 per kilogram for regular-milled rice and P45 per kilogram for well-milled rice. The order had been in effect since September 5. “Farmgate price is now steady between P23 and P25 per kilo while retail prices of well-milled rice can be sold bet P43 to P44 per kilo, way below the price cap,” Cainglet said. For his part, Federation of Free Farmers national manager Raul Montemayor said Marcos’ decision to lift the price ceilings on rice will provide another boost to farmers. “It will stabilize palay prices during the ongoing harvest season and provide incentives for farmers to expand their production and reduce our reliance on imports,” Montemayor said. In an interview on Super Radyo dzBB, Grains Retailers' Confederation of the Philippines (GRECON) spokesperson Orly Manuntag also thanked the President for lifting the price control measure on rice, adding that market forces should continue to dictate prices. Department of Trade and Industry (DTI)-Fair Trade and Enforcement Bureau Director Fhillip Sawali, during a press briefing in Makati City, said Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual and Department of Agriculture (DA) Senior Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban signed a joint memorandum circular, recommending the lifting of the mandated price ceiling. The recommendation to lift the price cap was based on specific indicators. \"The average selling prices are close to the mandated price ceilings which has an increasing compliance rate, while average farmgate price is maintained at P14 to P23 per kilo,\" Sawali said. Moreover, the DTI official added that there was a stable supply of stocks as there was an observed increase in sellers of regular milled and well-milled rice, while volume of import is sufficient. \"Since the implementation of EO 39, the DA has delivered a total of 567,205 kilos of rice, sold to rice retailers and Kadiwa outlets,\" Sawali said. \"From September 26, there were 456 rice containers released from the ports, of which, 168 were released from the Manila North Harbor, and 288 were released from the Manila South Harbor, while 597 rice containers remain docked as of October 2, 2023,\" the DTI official added. Sawali added the DTI and the DA also considered \"favorable external factors\" such as \"the world price of rice is decreasing\" in recommending for the lifting of the price cap mandate. —VAL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Small independent hospitals and community clinics will have a stronger footing if they consolidate their operations through mergers and acquisitions, according to Fortman Cline Capital Markets (FCCM). FCCM, a corporate finance advisory and consulting firm, said that the country’s healthcare industry is \"highly fragmented,\" with multiple brand leaders across various sectors such as hospitals, clinics, pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, diagnostic centers, and health maintenance organizations (HMOs). With such a landscape, FCCM managing director Francis Del Val said it presents opportunities for mergers and acquisitions to create an integrated ecosystem among industry players, especially for small hospitals and community clinics. He said that independent hospitals are \"feeling the squeeze\" since \"they don’t have enough allied healthcare professionals.\" \"It is something that we need to collectively focus on; those in the middle, such as the independent hospitals, are the ones feeling the squeeze… they are those experiencing financial challenges and unavailable to grow their utilization,\" Del Val said. \"Before we have community clinics in poblacion, in the center of the town, if they fail, it means our patients would need to travel further. They are the ones at most risk,\" he said. \"Consolidations and alliances are seen to emerge to allow the industry to become more efficient, respond faster to emerging trends in the healthcare industry as well as to the impact of Universal Health Care (UHC), which was signed into law in 2019,\" he added. According to the Department of Health (DOH), there are 1,071 private hospitals and 721 public hospitals. Among the public hospitals, 70 are operated by the DOH. Meanwhile, the Philippines’ private hospital owners are led by Metro Pacific Health (3,895 beds), United Laboratories’ Mount Grace Hospitals (1,700 beds), St. Luke’s Medical Center (1,250 beds), The Medical City (1,040 beds), and AC Health (531 beds and over 100 clinics). \"There will be opportunities for the private sector to be seen as the trusted partners of local government units (LGUs) who will primarily be implementing the UHC, as they may not always have the expertise nor the trained staff to succeed. Collaboration between the private and public sectors is key to [moving] the UHC agenda forward,'' Del Val said. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Agriculture-Bureau of Plant Industry (DA-BPI) has blacklisted three agricultural importers over allegedly not having required permits, clearances or licenses. In a statement on Wednesday, the DA said the BPI blacklisted LVM Grains Enterprises, “which imported milled rice, cashew nuts, and coffee without the necessary sanitary and phytosanitary import clearances.” Also placed on blacklist were Kysse Lishh Consumer Goods Trading and Golden Rays Consumer Goods Trading “due to their respective importation of onions and oranges without SPIC (sanitary phytosanitary import clearance) permits and import licenses.” “We will not turn a blind eye to these importers’ illegal practices that undermine government revenues and put public health at risk,” said Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. “To do so would be to abdicate our sworn duty to protect our farmers and the Filipino consumers,” said Tiu Laurel. The Agriculture Department said the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) is leading the prosecution of the three companies accused of engaging in anti-competitive trade activities. Meanwhile, the DA said the import licenses of five other firms—which it did not disclose yet—have been suspended for revocation due to misdeclarations, illegal importation, and anti-competitive trade practices. “We will withhold the identities of these five importers because the cases we filed against them are still pending. Until their cases are resolved, however, they cannot transact with BPI,” said BPI director Gerald Glenn Panganiban. Last month, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. signed into law a measure that classifies smuggling, hoarding, and cartel operations involving agricultural products as economic sabotage. The DA said the new law would mean stiffer fines and longer jail terms for those who violate the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act. The law considers smuggling and hoarding of agricultural products as economic sabotage when the value of goods exceeds P10 million. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

CA Committee on Trade and Industry Vice Chairman and Pangasinan 5th District Rep. Ramon Guico Jr. made the motion to recommend the confirmation of Pascual’s appointment. “Is there any objection? There being none, the same is hereby approved. Congratulations Secretary Pascual,” CA panel Chairman Iloilo 4th District Rep. Ferjenel Biron said. During the hearing, legislators questioned Pascual on the issues of skyrocketing prices of agricultural commodities, particularly onion and the actions that his department will take to combat hoarding and cartels. Pascual, in response, said the DTI has already sought the assistance of the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) to “use the full force of the law” against anti-competitive and abusive business practices. Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel again raised the issue that some employees of the Philippine Economic Zone Authority - an attached agency of the DTI - were either demoted or terminated. During the proceedings, it was revealed that one employee was already reinstated and three contractual or job order employees were not renewed for another contract. Pimentel suggested to Pascual to hire the contractual workers once they reapplied. “Gusto ko lang ipabatid sa Commission na napadalhan na po ng e-mail ang tatlong contractual employees na hindi na-renew ang contract at pinaa-apply sila sa mga position na available ngayon,” Pascual said. (I want to tell the Commission that the three contractual employees who weren't renewed were already sent with emails inviting them to apply for positions available.) Various business groups have been rallying behind and endorsing the confirmation of Pascual as DTI secretary. Among these groups are the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PCCI), Employers Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP), Philippine Exporters Confederation Inc. (PhilExport), Management Association of the Philippines (MAP), and Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, Inc (FFCCCII). The DTI-Employees Union and the Board of Investments Employees Association (BOIEA) also threw their support behind the appointment of Pascual as DTI secretary. Pascual also received support from various business groups such as the Financial Executives Institute of the Philippines (FINEX), PCCI Catanduanes, Albay Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Philippine Exporters Confederation (Region XI Chapter) Inc., and PhilExport Aklan Chapter Inc. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "As the Department of Justice (DOJ) continues to evaluate several pending Dengvaxia cases, doctors involved remain optimistic that the charges will be dismissed. In a statement on Saturday, former Health Undersecretary Dr. Kenneth Hartigan-Go expressed gratitude for the “enlightenment” brought to the cases and called for the revocation of licenses for “fake experts.” \"Itong issue ay complicated na even mga kasamahan namin na doctor or mga public health specialists ay naghirap sa pagpaliwanag sa publiko… Ang mga nanlinlang, nagsinungaling, at nagpanggap na eksperto at nagkalat ng maling informasyon ay dapat tanggalan ng licensiya at paalalahanan ng kanilang ethical obligation,\" said Go. (This issue is so complex that even fellow doctors and public health specialists struggle to explain it to the public. Those who misled, lied, pretended to be experts, and spread misinformation should have their licenses revoked and be reminded of their ethical obligations.) Pathologist Dr. Raymund Lo also maintained that no evidence links the Dengvaxia vaccine to the alleged deaths. No direct causal relationship DOJ Undersecretary Raul Vasquez echoed this sentiment, stating that there was no “direct causal relationship” between the vaccine and the deaths. He emphasized that multiple factors were considered in the case re-evaluation. Vasquez also defended the scientists’ swift response to the Dengvaxia cases, explaining that cases were reviewed in batches. \"Sa dami kasi, per batch namin ginawa. Nagkataon, nauna itong 98...'yung mga taong 'yan lang ang nanghingi ng affirmative relief sa batas at sa batas natin, 'yun lamang mga nanghingi ng affirmative relief ang mabibigyan ng relief,\" Vasquez explained. (Because of the sheer number of cases, we processed them in batches. It just so happened that these 98 cases came first. Only those who sought affirmative relief under the law can be granted it.) He further clarified in a radio interview that, for scientific evidence to establish a link between vaccination and death, the fatality must have occurred within eight days of receiving the vaccine. “Sa batas kasi natin, sa criminal procedure, dapat may cause-effect relationship. Be it criminal negligence or intentional acts, merong direct causal relationship,” said Vasquez. (In our legal system, both criminal negligence and intentional acts require a direct cause-and-effect relationship.) “Hindi ito personality-driven, ito ay base sa ebidensya lamang. At kami ay sumunod sa ebidensya, inaral namin ng mainam at ito ay lumabas na hindi masusuportahan ang present evidence… Lahat ng mga ebidensya ay hearsay evidence. Walang personal knowledge,” he said. (This is not personality-driven; it is solely based on evidence. After a thorough examination, the existing evidence does not support the claims. All the presented evidence was hearsay with no direct personal knowledge.) Meanwhile, relatives of Dengvaxia victims staged a protest urging Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla to further investigate the cases. This demonstration followed the DOJ’s resolution to withdraw the reckless imprudence resulting in homicide case filed against former Health Secretary Janette Garin and others involved. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Marcos administration on Monday bared its plan to enhance the salt production in the country. In a statement, the Office of the Press Secretary (OPS) said the Department of Agriculture, which is being headed by President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr., will lead the efforts together with other government agencies. The plan includes the following: The DTI has increased the prices of salt after years of it remaining unchanged. It approved an increase in prices of iodized rock salt to P21.75 for 500 grams and P23.00 for one kilogram. When it comes to iodized salt, the suggested retail price for a 100-gram pack is set at P4.50, while the price for a 250-gram pack ranges from P9.00 to P11.75 and P16.00 to P21.25 for a 500-gram pack. One kilogram of salt is priced at P29.00. Don't take salt for granted Senator Imee Marcos said she will discuss with President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. measures to increase the salt production in the country. The senator recommended additional funding for the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources to ramp up the knowledge transfer, research, training, and technical assistance in modern salt production technology. \"I will certainly take up measures for ample production of salt, besides rice and sugar, with PBBM,” Marcos said in a statement. According to Marcos, local salt producers need new technology and proper machinery that Republic Act 8172 or An Act for Salt Iodization Nationwide was supposed to have promoted. Meanwhile, Marcos said that the Ilocos Region, particularly Pangasinan and La Union, are among the country’s major salt producers but were not given ample support by previous administrations. “We’ve taken salt for granted despite its many uses not only in cooking but also in health and agriculture. Salt is used in manufacturing medicines, food preservatives, animal feed, and fertilizer,” she said. The senator said that the supposed salt shortage has led to higher prices of dried fish such as tuyo and daing and fish paste or bagoong. She said information gathering showed that tuyo prices increased from P200 to P280 in wet markets in Tondo, Manila, and Balintawak. The Department of Trade and Industry has stressed that there is no shortage of salt in the country and that the increase in prices of salt came six years after the last hike.— Anna Felicia Bajo/Joahna Lei Casilao/KBK, GMA News",

At a ceremony at Malacañang Palace, Marcos receive the credentials of Ambassador Ahmed Saad Nasser Abdullah Al-Hamidi of Qatar and Ambassador Alvaro Domingo Jara Bucarey of Chile. As he welcomed Bucarey, Marcos said the two countries could work together on various aspects including disaster response, climate change, energy security as well as enhanced government-to-government collaboration and public private partnerships (PPPs). Marcos said the Philippines is looking at new technologies and best practices around the world to transition from traditional fossil fuels to renewables. For his part, Bucarey told Marcos about Chile's potential for both solar and geothermal energy, adding its needs on new technologies and partners to harness such power sources. “With solar energy we have been able to modify the energy production in Chile. And we would like to see the north of Chile… there is a lot of presence, tourism mostly but they have an immense potential for energy generation,” Bucarey said. Marcos also mentioned to Bucarey some of the new ideas and technologies that are available to both countries, noting that the Philippines needs partners to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic. “So I look forward to that, Mr. Ambassador, and I’m very happy that you have come as the envoy from your country and I am sure – I hope that you will get to see some of my country,” the President said. Meanwhile, Marcos also welcomed Al-Hamidi as he expressed hope that the Philippines could work closely with Qatar. He said he admires the country as it was able to transform its economy and \"moved away from the traditional sources of revenue to new income sources with a very clear understanding of the future.\" “I think that there are many areas that will provide us opportunities for partnership,” Marcos said. Al-Hamidi, on the other hand, vowed that Qatar is willing to work with the Philippines in exploring some of the opportunities that the two nations have great potential through years of diplomatic relations. Marcos also received the credentials of Ambassador Dato Abdul Malik Melvin Castelino Bin Anthony of Malaysia and Ambassador Megawati Dato Paduka Haji Manan of Brunei Darussalam. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

Under the Price Act, a 60-day automatic price freeze is implemented when a state of calamity is declared, covering goods such as canned fish, locally manufactured instant noodles, bottled water, bread, processed milk, coffee, candles, laundry soap, detergent, and salt. “Our on-the-ground regional and provincial offices actively monitor prices and supply levels of products without our jurisdiction in affected areas,” DTI Acting Secretary Cristina Roque said in a statement. “In close coordination with the Office of the Civil Defense (OCD), we are prepared to enforce the automatic price freeze that accompanies any state of calamity declaration,” she added. Albay was placed under a state of calamity on Tuesday as the provincial government cited the continuous rainfall that resulted in flooding and landslides in vulnerable areas. Magpet town in Cotabato is also currently under a state of calamity. Violators of the price freeze will face penalties of imprisonment for a period of one year to ten years or a fine ranging from P5,000 to P1 million, or both, at the discretion of the court. The DTI has urged consumers to report retailers, distributors, and manufacturers selling above the prevailing prices. “The DTI will take strong action against any violations, which may include administrative cases and fines,” Roque said. At 11 a.m. Wednesday, the state weather bureau PAGASA raised Tropical Cyclone Wind Signal (TCWS) No. 2 over 31 areas in Luzon as Kristine maintained its strength and accelerated on its way to the Isabela area. Kristine was last located 200 kilometers east of Casiguran, Aurora, packing maximum sustained winds of 85 kilometers per hour (km/h) near the center and gustiness of up to 105 km/h, while moving north northwestward at 30 km/h. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

That’s why they are very interested in the Philippines, so let us not let go of it. We should protect our territory,” he said. He made the comments before a panel that included National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Secretary Arsenio Balisacan, Finance Secretary Ralph Recto, and Budget and Management Secretary Amenah Pangandaman. Continuing his remarks, Ang also provided a reason why fuel and power prices in the Philippines remain high compared with its neighbors. “If you look at it on an equal basis, our prices without the subsidy and without taxes, is even lower than Malaysia, Indonesia, and Thailand. It’s also the same as power. Our power generation compared to our neighboring countries are lower but we impose taxes on the power sector and fuel and we also don’t give subsidy on power that’s why our power prices are higher,” he said. To recall, the Philippines won in 2016 as it secured a landmark ruling by an international tribunal invalidating Beijing’s massive South China Sea claims. China has refused to acknowledge such a ruling, with over 50 of its vessels spotted in the vicinity of Iroquois Reef and Sabina Shoal in the area, as reported by the Western Command earlier this month. On the sidelines of the briefing, Ang said the planned P95-billion Pasig River Expressway (PAREX) could still push through , should public concerns be addressed as groups earlier expressed opposition citing the potential impact on traffic and the environment. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Jad Dera, the erstwhile detainee at the National Bureau of Investigation jail who allegedly managed to leave and return to his detention, may have influenced some of the probes by the NBI, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said on Monday. Dera, who has been transferred to the Muntinlupa City Jail , was arrested recently with six NBI security officers after he left the agency’s detention facility supposedly to go out on a date. There were reportedly other instances when Dera left the jail with his escorts and later returned. “‘Yung nangyari kay Dera… mabuting nangyari ‘yan kasi may natuklasan kami na mga gawain ni Dera sa loob na kung saan naimpluwensyahan niya mga ibang imbestigasyon ng mga taong nakakulong doon sa loob,” Remulla said in a media briefing. (What happened with Dera is a good thing because we discovered things Dera was doing that may have influenced the investigation of the detained individuals.) He said Dera achieved this through his position as a “mayores,\" or a leader among detainees. Remulla said the DOJ was still investigating how much Dera influenced the situation at the NBI. When asked if Dera may have influenced the recantations of the accused in the killing of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo, Remulla said, \"Wala ho tayong inaatrasan na posibiidad.\" (We are not discounting any possibility.) Atty. Raymund Palad, Dera's legal counsel, denied that his client had that much influence. “My client does not wield that alleged ‘powers’ as claimed by SOJ,\" Palad told GMA News Online. “Friendship is different sa power,” he added. Palad said Dera was too young to be a \"mayor\" inside the NBI jail The DOJ had said that Dera enjoyed certain privileges at the NBI facility such as being able to come and go from the facility, food, and sleeping conditions. During a Senate hearing, Dera admitted that he was able to leave the NBI facility multiple times, and only one of those trips had a court order. He said he was able to leave the NBI’s detention facility on January 20, 2022 to have himself checked in a hospital in Manila which was authorized by a court order dated December 10, 2021. Dera also admitted that he was able to leave the detention facility for the second time to go to another hospital and have his heart checked, but this time he had no approval from the court. The third time that he was able to leave the NBI was on Father’s Day this year and the fourth time was on June 20, reportedly for a date, where he and five NBI jail guards were nabbed. Dera also confirmed claims that he was also able to go to Calatagan, Batangas and being able to go to Tagaytay City with other NBI officers. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

In a 16-page complaint affidavit, the complainants asked the Ombudsman to indict Panganiban for Usurpation of Official Functions or Article 177 of the Revised Penal Code, as well as violation of Republic Act 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. “The indisputable fact is that there was no Sugar Order establishing a sugar importation program between the period of 20 October 2022 and 14 February 2023 or prior to the issuance of S06,” the complainants said. “This means that there was no Sugar Order to warrant the importation of... sugar that arrived in the Batangas Port on 9 February, making the imported sugar a smuggled agricultural product,” they added. The complainants were the National Congress of Unions in the Sugar Industry of the Philippines – Agrarian Reform Beneficiaries Council and the Alternatiba ng Masa party-list. Panganiban, the sole respondent, previously said that a sugar order was not necessary before an importation can be made. The complainants argued that while Panganiban was a senior undersecretary, he is not a member of the Sugar Regulatory Administration Board. “Which means that he has no power to perform any act relating to the management, production, regulation, and, let alone, the importation of sugar,” the complainants said. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2024-10-30T15:48:00",
    "article_body": "The Philippines' sovereign debt has ballooned to a fresh record-high of nearly P16 trillion as of end-September 2024, amid the government's continued fundraising initiatives to augment budgetary requirements. Data released by the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) on Wednesday showed that the national government's outstanding debt stood at P15.893 trillion during the period, up 2.2% from P15.55 trillion as of end-August 2024. Year-on-year, the country's running sovereign debt pile grew by 11.4% from P14.268 trillion recorded as of end-September 2023. Despite the debt level rise, the Treasury said that the latest debt figures were \"manageable.\" As of the first half of 2024, the country’s debt-to-gross domestic product (GDP) ratio stood at 60.9% , just few percentage points above the internationally accepted comfortable threshold of 60%. Debt-to-GDP ratio measures the amount of the national government's outstanding debt proportionate to the value of the economy during a specific period. For this year, the Marcos administration is targeting to hit a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60.6%. Meanwhile, the majority or 68.81% of the end-September 2024 debt level was sourced from the domestic market while the external risk exposure was at 31.19%. In particular, domestic debt reached P10.94 trillion, up 1.3% month-on-month, \"mainly driven by P145.11 billion net issuance of new government securities, which was slightly offset by a P460 million decrease in the value of US dollar-denominated securities due to the appreciation of the Philippine peso.\" External debt, on the other hand, reached P4.96 trillion, up 4.2% from a month earlier. The growth in the country's foreign debt was driven by the \"P200.89 billion in net foreign borrowings, including P140.99 billion ($2.5 billion) in new US dollar bonds floatation to support general budgetary requirements.\" \"Nevertheless, favorable foreign exchange adjustments contributed a substantial decrease of P2.43 billion in the overall external debt,\" the Treasury said. Finance Secretary Ralph Recto earlier said that the country's sovereign debt could balloon to as much as P20 trillion by the end of President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.’s term in 2028. Recto, nonetheless, said that while the nominal debt continues to rise, the country's economic growth would outpace the increase in debts. He said the Philippine economy could reach a value of P37 trillion by 2028, versus a projected debt stock of P20 trillion. Due to the aggressive borrowing spree to fund response, relief, and cash aid efforts amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the country’s debt-to-GDP grew to 60.5% in 2021, higher than the 54.6% level in 2020. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Philippines' debt-to-GDP ratio had reached a record low of 39.6% in 2019. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) chief was referring to the Guos’ legal counsel Stephen David’s statement that Wesley wanted to surrender to authorities. Refusing to divulge details, Abalos said an “ongoing team” was handling the matter. “Puwedeng wala muna akong sasabihin about that. I might preempt it. I only confirmed that… as stated by the lawyer but there is this ongoing team,” he said. “There is this ongoing at inaayos na rin namin po yan ng DILG, PNP (Philippine National Police), and the other camp,” he added. Authorities earlier said that Wesley, who is among the personalities ordered arrested by the Senate, had attempted to fly to Hong Kong the last week of August. Last Wednesday, immigration officials said Indonesian authorities have been looking for Wesley. According to Alice and Wesley's supposed sister Shiela, the three of them left the Philippines via three boat rides to Malaysia. From there, they flew to Singapore and then to Batam, Indonesia via ferry. Shiela said she parted ways with Wesley and Alice in Batam, Indonesia where she and Cassandra Li Ong were arrested.

    "article_body": "The Land Transportation Office (LTO) has confirmed that the number \"7\" protocol plate used by the white sports utility vehicle (SUV) who escaped apprehension after using the EDSA Busway on Sunday was \"fake,\" according to Senate President Francis \"Chiz\" Escudero. In a statement, Escudero said that the LTO informed him that there was no “7” protocol plate issued for the type of vehicle that was involved in the incident. “Napatunayan ng LTO na peke yung plaka na ginamit ng SUV sa video. Hindi dapat magtapos dito ang isyu na ito. Kailangan matukoy ng LTO kung sino ang may-ari ng sasakyan at siguraduhin na mananagot ito sa paglabag ng batas,” Escudero said. (The LTO has proven that the license plate used by the SUV in the video is fake. This issue should not end here. The LTO needs to identify the owner of the vehicle and ensure that they are held accountable for violating the law.) Escudero has initially expressed suspicion on the protocol plate that was seen in the Department of Transportation-Special Action and Intelligence Committee for Transportation's (DOTr-SAICT) video. The Senate president noted that the “7” plates issued to senators bear no other markings, including years or dates similar to the one seen on the SUV. While he thanked the LTO for their action on the incident, the Senate President said this \"should not go unpunished.\" \"This particular incident should not go unpunished. Not only was it a violation of multiple laws and traffic rules, it also affects the sanctity of the Senate as an institution,” Escudero said. In an earlier statement, LTO said that \"there was no protocol plate issued to the particular SUV\" that was involved in the incident based on the assessment of the pieces of evidence at hand. \"Currently, we are coordinating with the DOTr-SAICT for more specific details of the white SUV that will lead to the identification of the registered owner,\" the LTO said. \"We assure the public that a Show Cause Order (SCO) will be issued to the registered owner and the driver of the SUV involved in the soonest possible time for them to explain the string of violations we already identified based on our existing laws and rules and regulations, including disregarding traffic signs and improper person to operate a motor vehicle,\" it added. The LTO also said that they will coordinate with Escudero's office with regard to all information that it will obtain from their investigation on the incident. Based on the DOTR's policy, only the following are allowed to use the busway: Stiff fines have also been imposed for EDSA Busway violators. First-time offenders are fined P5,000, while the second offense would entail a P10,000 fine, a one-month suspension of the driver’s license, and a mandatory road safety seminar. The third offense would have a P20,000 fine on top of a one-year suspension of the driver’s license, while the fourth offense would have a P30,000 fine and a recommendation to the Land Transportation Office for the driver’s license to be revoked. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Monday said it is targeting to eradicate the communist insurgency in the country within this year. AFP spokesperson Colonel Francel Margareth Padilla made the statement following a command conference of the military organization recently. “So we were given specific deadline to do such. As I said a while ago, hindi tayo mag-mamicromanage (we won't micromanage). So within the span of the year po, we're looking at eliminating the threat, internal insurgency situation,” Padilla said at a news conference. On January 15, AFP chief General Romeo Brawner Jr. said the number of weakened guerilla fronts of the New People's Army (NPA) has decreased to 11 with around 1,500 members left. \"We have given our commanders on the ground targets to dismantle the remaining guerilla fronts,\" Brawner said last week. He added that while there are no more active NPA guerilla fronts, the weakened groups are still a force to be reckoned with. In November 2023, the Marcos administration and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) agreed to resume the stalled peace negotiations . Representatives from both camps signed a joint statement for \"a principled and peaceful resolution to the armed conflict.\" Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro later clarified that what was agreed upon was for \"exploratory talks\" and not formal peace negotiations yet . The Philippines has been battling the communist insurgency for over five decades. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

    "date_published": "2024-04-26T15:20:00",
    "article_body": "The Philippine National Police (PNP) has revoked the gun permit of Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) leader Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, who is facing charges in the Philippines and even in the United States. \"Yes,\" Philippine National Police (PNP) spokesperson Police Colonel Jean Fajardo told reporters in a message when asked if PNP chief Police General Rommel Marbil has approved the recommendation to revoke Quiboloy's license to own and possess firearms (LTOPF). The PNP's Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO) earlier recommended the revocation of Quiboloy's guns, citing Section 4 (g) of the Comprehensive Firearms and Ammunition Regulation Act. Under the Standards and Requisites for Issuance of and Obtaining a License to Own and Possess Firearms of the Law, “The applicant has not been convicted or is currently an accused in a pending criminal case before any court of law for a crime that is punishable with a penalty of more than two years.” Legal disability for gun ownership also includes “pendency of a criminal case with imposable penalty of two years.” Quiboloy has 19 firearms and the license of one of them already expired in March, the PNP said. Senator Risa Hontiveros, who leads the Senate probe into Quiboloy’s alleged involvement in human trafficking and sexual abuses, thanked the PNP for its response to her call to revoke the pastor's gun permits. She asked the PNP to ensure that no firearms will be left to the members of Quiboloy’s group. “Dapat lang na mabuwag na ang private army niya, na todo-balandra rin ng kanilang mga baril sa social media. At higit sa lahat, harinawa, maaresto na si Quiboloy sa lalong madaling panahon. He continues to mock our institutions. Kamakailan lang nagpalabas na naman siya ng audio recording kung saan nagbigay pa siya ng bugtong tungkol sa location niya,” she said. “Matapos nilang pagdiskitahan ang Senado bilang institusyon, ngayon naman, ang ating kapulisan ang iniinsulto. Hindi tayo papayag na pagmukhain niya tayong tanga,” she added. The Senate has issued an arrest order against Quiboloy for \"unduly refusing to appear, despite due notices\" at hearings on his alleged involvement in the sexual abuse of his members and human trafficking issues. A Davao court also issued a warrant of arrest against Quiboloy and five others over charges of child abuse. Four of the co-accused turned themselves in, while another, Cresente Canada, was arrested by National Bureau of Investigation agents. All five have posted bail, while Quiboloy remains at large. An arrest warrant was also issued by a Pasig court for Quiboloy for human trafficking charges. In the United States, Central District of California Judge Terry Hatter Jr. on March 7 ordered the unsealing of the arrest warrants against Quiboloy and his co-accused. The unsealing was requested by the United States Attorney Criminal Division handling Quiboloy's case, which involves charges of conspiracy to engage in sex trafficking by force, fraud, coercion, sex trafficking of children, conspiracy, and cash smuggling. \"Upon application of the government, and for good cause shown, the arrest warrants and returns in this case are unsealed,\" Hatter said in his order dated March 1, 2024. President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. earlier said the proceedings against Quiboloy would be fair, adding that the latter should not worry about the United States meddling in his cases. Quiboloy has denied the accusations against him. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Detained former senator Leila De Lima on Friday urged Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla to \"make justice work again\" in the country following his son's arrest for a drug-related offense. Juanito Jose Remulla III was nabbed earlier this week in Las Piñas City in connection with a shipment of suspected kush worth P1.3 million that was intercepted at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) in Pasay City. Government prosecutors on Friday filed a case for drug possession before the Las Piñas Regional Trial Court while the charges of importation of dangerous drugs and violation of the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act would be referred to the Pasay Prosecutor’s Office for preliminary investigation. “Like everyone else, whether he is the son of the Justice Secretary or not, Juanito Jose Remulla is presumed innocent until proven guilty,\" De Lima said in a statement. \"This same cardinal presumption is what should have been upheld for those who have been judged only too swiftly in the past administration's drug war and who were not given the chance to defend themselves before the courts,” she added. De Lima has been detained since February 2017 due to allegations that, while serving as secretary of the Department of Justice, she conspired to commit illegal drug trading with corrections officials and inmates. One of the three drug cases against De Lima was junked by a Muntinlupa City court in February last year. She has repeatedly denied involvement in the illegal drug trade. De Lima said every person charged with a crime deserves a fair trial “regardless of his station in life.” The former senator also lauded Remulla's statement that he would not interfere in the case and instead leave his son's fate to the justice system. “Any justice system is only worth the faith we put in it. I hope it works for Sec. Remulla's son, as I hope that it will also work for me, as well as for the thousand others who were condemned to death without trial during the past administration,” De Lima said. “Sec. Remulla, for the sake of your son, for my sake, and [for] the thousands killed whose families are still grieving, make justice work again in this country.” — VBL, GMA News",

    "article_body": "The Department of Health (DOH) on Sunday said it will conduct a national COVID-19 booster week on September 26 to 29 to ramp up the booster uptake among the general population. The Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF) also recommended such, in line with its proposal to make the wearing of face masks outdoors optional by year-end, Lorra Angelia Sayson, DOH head assistant to the officer-in-charge Secretary, said. “All government agencies are to implement sector specific policies at lalo na ‘yung magpo-provide ng incentives (especially providing incentives) to encourage individuals to get boosters. Katuwang po natin dito ang iba’t ibang mga ahensiya upang maisakatuparan itong national booster week natin (we are partnering with different agencies to make this happen),” she said in a Super Radyo dzBB interview. Pending President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr.’s formal approval, the IATF has proposed the voluntary wearing of face masks in open spaces or non-crowded outdoor areas with good ventilation, provided that the COVID-19 booster uptake in the country improves. However, based on the DOH’s national COVID-19 vaccination dashboard, only 18.5 million Filipinos have received their booster shots as of September 9. This is still a far cry from the 72.7 million Filipinos who are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Sayson said that throughout the four-day national booster week by end-September, the government is eyeing to administer more booster shots in order to achieve its PinasLakas target by October 8. The PinasLakas campaign aimed to give booster doses to 50% of the country's eligible population or 23.8 million Filipinos within the first 100 days of the Marcos administration. DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire earlier said the DOH increased its target to more than 400,000 COVID-19 booster shots per day after the campaign failed to meet its daily goals since it started. One of the reasons the DOH sees for the refusal to get the booster dose is that nine out of 10 Filipinos are \" overconfident \" about the protection elicited by the first two COVID-19 doses and see no need of getting a booster shot. The DOH on Saturday logged 3,165 new COVID-19 cases , bringing the nationwide tally to 3,904,133. Active cases, meanwhile, increased to 26,074. A total of 1,287 new recoveries were recorded, with the recovery tally now at 3,815,771. Thirty-nine new fatalities were reported, bringing the death toll to 62,288. —KG, GMA News",

In a statement, Sara said the practice shows the propensity of politicians to buy votes during elections. \"Ito ay pagsasamantala sa kahirapan ng ating mga mamamayan at kawalan ng respeto sa kanilang karapatan na magdesisyon nang malaya, walang takot, o impluwensya gamit ang salapi,\" Sara said. (This is an exploitation of the poverty of our citizens and shows a lack of respect for their right to make decisions freely, without fear, or being influenced with money.) \"Para sa mga Pilipino, alalahanin din natin na maaaring ang sukli sa suhol kapalit ng pirma sa people’s initiative ay may seryosong konsekwensiya sa ating buhay, kalayaan, at kinabukasan,\" she added. (For Filipinos, let us remember that the exchange of bribes in exchange for signing the people's initiative has serious consequences on our lives, freedom, and future.) Several lawmakers have reported that signatures are being gathered in the communities in exchange for cash. There are also reports that government subsidies are being used to entice voters to sign and support the people's initiative. The Commission on Elections has been receiving from hundreds of municipalities and cities stacks of papers containing signatures in support of a people's inititaive to amend the 1987 Constitution. Under the 1987 Constitution, amendments can be directly proposed by the people \"through initiative upon a petition of at least 12% of the total number of registered voters, of which every legislative district must be represented by at least 3% of the registered voters therein, a mode called people’s initiative.\" “Our election officers are checking page by page to make sure that the tally on the number of signatures affixed is correct, so they are able to ensure that they issue the correct certification [on the number of signatures. Kindly give us until Friday to know how many cities and municipalities have submitted signature pages so far,” Comelec chairman George Garcia said. In the signature pages Garcia said the voters were asked if they were in favor of amending Article 17, Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution by allowing all members of Congress to jointly vote on proposed constitutional amendments in a constituent assembly. The current Article 17 Section 1 of the 1987 Constitution does not explicitly provide whether members of the Senate and the House of Representatives should vote jointly or separately. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "Foreign direct investments (FDIs) into the Philippines posted a double-digit decline in March as investors factored in concerns over slower economic growth prospects across the globe, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) reported Tuesday. Data released by the central bank showed that FDI net inflows stood at $548 million in March, 30.7% lower than $792 million the same month last year, and lower than $1.047 billion in February. “The said decline resulted from lower net inflows from across all major FDI components amid investor concerns over subdued global growth prospects,” the BSP said in an accompanying statement. Inflows of non-residents in net debt instruments fell by 37.2% to $389 million, net equity other than reinvestment of earnings dropped by 11.7% to $94 million, and reinvestment of earnings slipped by 0.1% to $65 million. Equity capital placements for the month came mostly from Singapore, Japan, and the United States, which were then channeled to manufacturing (27%), information and communication (26%), real estate (23%), and others (25%). The latest figures brought the first-quarter FDI net inflows down 19.6% to $2.042 billion from $2.542 billion the comparable period last year. Japan, Singapore, and the United States were the top country sources for the period. This comes as the current administration — led by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. — has continued to conduct roadshows across the globe to entice more investments into the country. Malacañang in December said Marcos’ foreign visits in 2022 alone have generated $23.6-billion in investment pledges.

So, we would be crafting and drafting this,\" Herbosa said at a Palace press briefing.

The council will serve as a national governance body that will oversee the implementation of Universal Health Care Act nationwide, the project and estimate total national cost for UHC and also implementation of the Universal Health Care at local government level,\" he said.

When he assumed post as DOH Secretary, Herbosa made a commitment to continuously usher UHC through interventions and reforms. Meanwhile, the DOH chief also said Marcos has tasked the DILG to expedite the review of Executive Order 138 on the implementation of the Supreme Court ruling on the Mandanas-Garcia petitions and to incorporate some of these to the UHC financing reforms in the amendments. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "The National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) on Monday said “no flying zone” or “no drone zone” will be implemented to secure the first State of the Nation Address (SONA) of President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in Batasang Pambansa on July 25. Interviewed on Super Radyo dzBB, NCRPO spokesperson Police Lieutenant Colonel Jenny Tecson said only authorized persons will be exempted from the ban. “Kagaya po noong mga nakaraan, meron po tayong no flying zone o no drone zone na ipapatupad doon sa area except po doon sa mga authorized lang po,” she said. (Like in the previous events, we will have no flying zone or no drone zone that will be implemented in the area, except those who are authorized to do so.) Tecson told GMA News Online that the coverage of the no flying zone or no drone zone will be discussed in the next meetings of security forces. A total of 21,853 security personnel will be deployed in the region and in 34 control border points for Marcos' first SONA, according to the NCRPO. The deployment is composed of 16,964 personnel from the NCRPO, 1,905 from Philippine National Police (PNP) support units, and 2,974 from coordinating agencies and other peacekeeping partners. According to the PNP, the police will exercise maximum tolerance with protesters, who are allowed to conduct rallies at freedom parks. —AOL, GMA News",

    "article_body": "Following the Metro Manila Council's (MMC's) approval of heftier penalties for violations of the EDSA Carousel, a lane dedicated only for buses, the steeper fines would take effect on Monday-November 13. The MMC approved the heftier fines as motorists were still willing to pay the fines — currently set at P1,000 for the first offense — and violate the bus lane exclusivity because “they can afford it.” Starting Monday, November 13, first-time offenders would be charged P5,000, while the second offense would entail a P10,000 fine, a one-month suspension of the driver’s license, and a mandatory road safety seminar. The third offense would have a P20,000 fine on top of a one-year suspension of the driver’s license, while the fourth offense would have a P30,000 fine and a recommendation to the Land Transportation Office for the driver’s license to be revoked. “‘Yang Bus Carousel ay exclusive sa bus lamang, so ‘pag pumasok ka diyan, alam mo agad na ikaw, you have the intention to violate the law,” Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) General Manager Procopio Lipana said in Dano Tingcungco's Sunday “24 Oras Weekend” report. Last June, the MMDA's Bus Management and Dispatch System (BMDS) started monitoring the EDSA Busway to ensure that the flow of buses was well-managed, and would reduce congestion. The DOTr last December said it planned to privatize the operation of the EDSA Bus Carouse l this year and would invite parties to participate in the bidding of the concession agreement. — Jon Viktor Cabuenas/DVM, GMA Integrated News",

    "article_body": "BAGUIO, Philippines – President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. signed into law several bills that establish College of Medicine programs in four state universities that will help advance medical education in the country. The four higher education institutions (HEIs) are: “Under the newly created laws, the HEIs can now proceed with offering a Doctor of Medicine Program, including an Integrated Liberal Arts and Medicine Program to develop a corps of professional physicians and help strengthen the country’s healthcare system,” the Presidential Communications office said on Thursday, December 28. “The laws also aim to respond to the human resource development needs of their respective provinces.” This comes amid the growing need for more medical education programs in the country. In the case of the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR), the Association of Philippine Medical Colleges noted that, as of June 2021, only two of the 58 medical colleges in the Philippines are located in the region. “The lack of medical institutions in the region results in high cost of medical education, consisting of transportation and accommodation allowance, for aspiring doctors, including my constituents,” said Benguet Representative Eric Yap, the bill’s sponsor. He added that the BSU College of Medicine would primarily offer a Doctor of Medicine program, incorporating an Integrated Liberal Arts and Medicine curriculum for a learner-centered and competency-based approach. The university is also expected to provide scholarships and other programs to support low-income students. In total, Marcos greenlit the expansion of the capacities of seven educational institutions. Bicol University will soon open its College of Veterinary Medicine, while the San Isidro Satellite campus of the Leyte Normal University and Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) Bagac Extension Campus in Bataan have both been converted to regular campuses. The campuses will be named LNU-San Isidro Campus and BPSU-Bagac Campus, respectively. – with a report from Kaycee Valmonte/Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "BENGUET, Philippines – The Benguet State University (BSU) opened its doors to chocolate enthusiasts and industry stalwarts as it hosts the first-ever Cordillera Chocolate Festival beginning on Valentine’s Day. The event, from February 14 to 15, showcases a wide array of cacao products from the provinces of the Cordillera, signaling the beginning of concerted efforts to strengthen the chocolate industry in the Cordillera Administrative Region. Under the theme “Generating Sustainable Cacao Value Chain,” the festival aims to highlight and promote sustainable practices within the local cacao industry, a crucial step toward ensuring the sector’s long-term viability and impact. The February 14 event also included the oathtaking of the new officers of the Cacao Growers and Processors Benguet-Baguio Federation before Benguet Governor Melchor Diclas. Diclas said there was a need for diversifying Benguet’s agricultural industry. “With the province’s growing population, we need to explore alternative industries. Cacao presents a viable option, especially as an alternative to our high-value crops like vegetables, which face price drops in December,” he said. Rolando Renegado, the regional cacao focal person for the Department of Agriculture’s (DA) High-Value Crops Development Program (HVCDP), said cacao has been considered a priority commodity in the region. The program, he said, has so far provided P6.645 million to aid the local cacao industry since 2020. “We aim to enable communities in processing tasks such as drying, fermentation, and roasting. Our goal is for local growers to move up the value chain, leveraging science and technology to innovate and improve their enterprises,” said Dr. Enrico Paringit of the Department of Science and Technology-Philippine Council for Industry, Energy, and Emerging Technology Research and Development. Those who took part in the festival’s opening were treated to an exhibit and sale of cacao chocolate products from various Cordillera processors, alongside competitions for the best tablea, the best 70% dark chocolate, and awards for the largest, heaviest, and most bean-filled cacao pods. Organizers said the two-day event also serves as a platform for the presentation of the terminal report of Project Sweet PH C, titled “Standardization of Ways in Enhancing and Establishing Techniques in Processing Highland Cacao,” and includes the distribution of a cacao protocol manual to growers and processors. The opening of the festival, organized by Dulche Chocolates Incorporated, a start-up funded by the DOST through the Women Helping Women: Innovating Social Enterprises Program, concluded with the distribution of pruning shears and saws, symbolizing the continuous support for the cultivation and maintenance of cacao trees. – Rappler.com",

Presidential Communication Office (PCO) Secretary Cheloy Garafil confirmed their appointment on Tuesday, January 31, as Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin administered the oath of office of its chair, lawyer Maisara Dandanum-Latiph, in Malacañang. Bersamin signed the appointment of Latiph and eight members of the Marawi Compensation Board on January 13. Latiph is a former legislator and member of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority (BTA), the interim government in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). Also appointed to the compensation board are the following: “The long wait is over,” said Drieza Lininding, the chairman of the Moro Consensus Group (MCG) which has been calling on the government for the past five years to compensate Maranao families affected by the Marawi Siege. Lininding asked the board to convene immediately and set the implementing rules for the distribution of a P1-billion compensation package for the affected residents. The board was created by a law to facilitate the tax-free payment of reparations to residents who lost residential and commercial properties during the fighting. The law grants private property owners compensation based on the sum of the current market value of their lots, and shoulder the replacement costs of structures and improvements. The Marawi Reconstruction and Conflict Watch hailed the appointment of MCB members, noting that five of its members are women. “The government made good its promise to compensate Marawi war victims with a reparation board that is truly independent, inclusive, and led by women,” the group said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines was selected Tuesday, July 9, to host the board of the Loss and Damage Fund, the global fund that will help vulnerable nations deal with the adverse effects of climate change. The selection of the Philippines comes after a two-and-a-half hour closed-door meeting of the Loss and Damage Fund board in Incheon, South Korea, on Tuesday. Other countries which expressed interest to host were Antigua and Barbuda, Armenia, the Bahamas, Barbados, Eswatini, Kenya, and Togo. In a statement, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the country’s inclusion in the board “ensures that the Philippines will be a formidable voice in promoting and advancing global climate action – an issue of critical interest to the country.” “Hosting the [LDF] board reinforces our dedication to inclusivity and our leadership role in ensuring that the voices of those most affected by climate change shape the future of international climate policies,” he added. The board’s co-chairs Richard Sherman of South Africa and France’s Jean-Christophe Donnellier are set to negotiate with the Philippine government to finalize the host country agreement. “We believe that the host country is a critical building block in the establishment and the operationalization of the loss and damage fund,” said former Philippine finance undersecretary Mark Joven during the meeting. Joven is the Philippine representative to the board which has 26 members: 12 from developed country parties and 14 from developing country parties. “We do not take this matter lightly and we commit to fully comply with the undertaking and promises made in the bid of the Philippines,” said Joven. “Rest assured that the government of the Philippines and the entire Filipino people are forever grateful for this trust bestowed upon us today.” The World Bank will operationalize the fund for an interim period of four years under an independent secretariat. In 2023, Marcos emphasized his intention for the country to host the fund. After the 28th session of the Conference of Parties concluded, the Philippines was able to secure a seat on the board. So far, rich countries responsible for most of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions have pledged $700 million to the loss and damage fund. – with a report from Dwight de Leon/Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "VIGAN, Philippines – Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong on Monday, January 9, said his desire to protect Filipino youth and help transform the Philippine National Police (PNP) made him accept the invitation to join the panel evaluating high-ranking officials for links to drug cartels. The former head of the PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group and the Directorate for Investigation and Detective Management said he initially thought of his past experience and the risks of going up against rogue cops, especially those linked to the illegal drug trade. But helping change the PNP and protecting young Filipinos from drugs outweighed this concern, the retired general told the media after a flag ceremony at the city hall grounds in Baguio. “I still want to help the PNP because of its ongoing transformation, and if you remember, I was formerly the head of the transformation program of the PNP,” he said in a mix of English and Filipino. “If there is anything that would adversely impact the development of our youth, that is (illegal) drugs,” Magalong added. Interior and Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos started 2023 with a call for senior police officials to submit courtesy resignations, calling it a “a shortcut” to cleansing the PNP of rogue cops. He invited Magalong to join a five-person committee that will evaluate police officials to determine links to the drug trade. Magalong said he has not yet received word about the start of the panel’s work. Nor are there defined guidelines on how they will go about the task, aside from the general mandate Abalos told him — “that is to screen, evaluate and validate.” While in the police service, Magalong had a reputation for independence and a willingness to take on peers and even the highest national government officials during scandals. “Isa sa mga inaalala ko ay yung risk na naman. Akala ko tapos na yung trabaho natin sa (illegal) drugs sa PNP pero ito, kalingan nanaman nating gawin,” Magalong recalled his thoughts when PNP Chief Rodolfo Azurin Jr. informed him of his nomination to the panel. (One of my concerns is the risk. I thought I was done with my work on illegal drugs in the PNP, but here it is again, a task that I must do.) He has accepted that “risk is part of the job.” In 2019, Magalong experienced security threats after testifying against then-PNP Chief Oscar Albayalde, whom he accused of intervening in the dismissal of 13 “ninja cops” in late 2016. “It would be a long, tedious process. That is why I am also worried about how I will perform my duties as mayor,” he said. The mayor said they are looking for steps to fast-track the evaluation process while ensuring due process. He assured constituents that he would not neglect Baguio and his commitment to making the city “smart, livable, green and clean.” Magalong added that for the past four years, he has been developing leaders in the city hall and empowering employees to ensure offices of the city government will function and discharge their duties even in his absence. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Former senator Panfilo “Ping” Lacson on Tuesday, February 18, appealed to lawmakers in both houses of Congress not to get involved in the implementation of government projects and reminded them of the scope of their jobs as legislators. Lacson made the appeal at the press conference of senatorial candidates of the Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilipinas, ahead of their campaign kickoff in vote-rich Metro Manila at the Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay City. He and weigh in on the hot issues of transparency and the fight against corruption. “Ang panawagan ko, sana lahat ng mambabatas, mapa-congressman man o senador, ‘wag makialam sa implementasyon ng mga proyekto. Kasi ang trabaho namin magbalangkas at mag-apruba, mag-submit ng panukalang batas para maging batas. Ngayon, kung makialam si congressman o si senador sa implementation, mapa-infra project o mapa-social services, mapamudmod ng kung anu-anong ayuda, diyan kasi nawawalan kami ng moral ascendancy,” Lacson said.(My appeal is for all lawmakers, whether congressman or senator, not to get involved in the implementation of projects. Because our job is to draft and approve, and submit bills to become laws. Now, if a congressman or senator interferes in the implementation, whether infrastructure projects or social services or distributing various kinds of aid there, we lose our moral ascendancy.)The former senator said the job of Congress ends once a bill is passed, enrolled, and signed by the President, and would be followed by oversight of the implementation of the law by the executive, and how the funds allotted for this purpose was spent. “Kasi meron kaming mandato ng oversight. Paano kami mag-i-implement ng oversight sa proyekto ng executive branch kung kami mismo, makikihalo sa implementasyon ng proyekto na hindi naman namin trabaho?” (We have the mandate of oversight. How can we implement oversight of a projects of the executive branch if we ourselves get involved in the implementation of a project that’s not part of our job? He added that the Constitution is clear on the separation of powers. Lacson made the appeal and reminder amid calls for politicians to keep out of cash aid programs. Presidential Commission for the Urban Poor (PCUP) chief Meynard Sabili had said that politicians should not get involved in the Ayuda Para sa Kapos ang Kita Program (AKAP) of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD), in particular. Among Lacson’s fellow candidates, reelectionist Senator Imee Marcos has been attending financial aid distributions under the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s Assistance to Individuals in Crisis Situation (AICS).AICS is a social services program that provides medical assistance, burial, transportation, education, food, and financial support for other services or needs of individuals or families. During the press conference, Lacson also said, in reply to questions, that one way to curb corruption in government is to make all transactions “fully digitized,” to remove human intervention. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government touted the Marcos administration’s anti-narcotics campaign before the United Nations (UN) Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ). During the 33rd session of the commission in Vienna on Monday, May 13, Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benhur Abalos asserted that the government’s supply and demand reduction strategy had been effective, resulting in a drug haul worth $587 million, two years since President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. assumed office. “[This accounts for] a 700% increase from previous years with minimal loss of life,” Abalos said. The present government has distanced itself from the bloody drug war of the Rodrigo Duterte administration, with Marcos insisting he is “diametrically opposed” to handling the drug menace with confrontation and violence. The Duterte administration logged 6,252 individuals killed in police operations under its drug war. Human rights groups, however, put the number at up to 30,000, to include victims of vigilante-style killings. Drug-related killings did not completely stop under the Marcos administration, although the number has decreased significantly. In the same speech on Monday, Abalos affirmed the Philippines’ commitment to the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and promised to further enhance the country’s justice system. The country is vying for a non-permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council for 2027 to 2028. – Rappler.com",

The proclamation was made public only on Thursday, July 27.

Duterte was mayor of Davao, a major Mindanao city, for decades before ascending to the presidency. The Marcos administration lifted the proclamation because, “through successful focused military and law enforcement operations and programs that promote sustainable and inclusive peace, the government has made significant gains in improving and restoring peace and order in the region.” The Duterte proclamation allowed the military and police to “undertake such measures as may be permitted by the Constitution and existing laws to suppress any and all forms of lawless violence in Mindanao and to prevent such lawless violence from spreading and escalating elsewhere in the Philippines with due regard to the fundamental civil and political rights of our citizens.” – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Senate panel investigating the illegal activities of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators in the country has asked the National Security Council (NSC) to help convince President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to ban POGOs. Senator Risa Hontiveros said this after leading an executive session on the illegal activities of POGOs and the alleged link to Bamban, Tarlac, Mayor Alice Guo to POGOs on Wednesday, June 5. “‘Yun ‘yung isang ipinanawagan, o suggestion siya noong executive session, kineri ko po talaga bilang chair na tulad noong ipinanawagan ko na ilang beses kay Presidente na i-ban na ang POGO. Patigilin na ito, palabasin, paalisin na sila sa ating bayan. Na-raise din ‘yung ganyang panawagan sa executive session at nasabi po namin directly sa NSC, bilang sila ‘yung Council o body sa loob ng gobyerno natin na pinaka-concern sa usaping national security,” Hontiveros told reporters right after the executive session. (That’s one of the calls. It’s a suggestion during the executive session, which I carried as chairman of the committee, like my previous calls for the President to ban POGO. It should be stopped, they should be expelled from the country. We raised this issue during the executive session and we told this directly to the NSC since they are the council or body in the government whose main concern are issues on national security threat.) “So ngayon, ang inaasahan ko ay mismo ng National Security Council bilang body sa gobyerno na may…mandato tungkol sa national security ay sana i-bring up na rin nila ito kay Presidente para, para makapagsalita na sila tungkol sa usapin ng POGO bilang national security threat,” she added. (So now, I expect the National Security Council, as the government body with the…mandate on national security to hopefully bring this up to the President so that they can discuss the aspect of POGOs as a national security threat.) The senator refused to disclose more information about the matter since the meeting was done in an executive session where “in principle, discussions should be confidential.” The Senate committee on women, children, family relations and gender equality led by Hontiveros held the executive session where the hacking of government websites and espionage were discussed. This was after senators found out that surveillance activities and even the hacking of government websites were traceable to the raided POGO firms in Bamban. Senators are probing Guo’s alleged involvement in the two illegal POGOs – Hongsheng Gaming Technology Incorporated and Zun Yuan Technology Incorporated, located in the Baofu Compound of Bamban, Tarlac. The said POGOs were raided due to complaints of human trafficking and love scams. Hontiveros said that the Intelligence Service of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (ISAFP) had conducted a “link analysis” between POGOs and several local government units and “influential figures.” Since the issue on POGOs broke last year, Marcos has not given a firm stand on banning POGOs in the country. At the House committee level, lawmakers passed a bill banning POGOs in the country on February 12. Meanwhile, senators are divided on the issue because of its possible impact on the economy. In June 2023, then-Senate president Migz Zubiri said that it was the call of the President to either stop or regulate POGO operations in the country since it’s the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation, under the Office of the President, that oversees it. – Rappler.com",

In 2022, the Philippine Supreme Court upheld most provisions of the anti-terror law, a measure passed during the administration of Marcos’ predecessor Rodrigo Duterte. Critics have feared that the legislation would be weaponized to target the opposition. According to rights groups, there are over 800 political prisoners in the Philippines – 90 of them arrested during the Marcos administration. There was no specific mention of human rights during Marcos’ 17-minute speech. Reporter Daniel Hurst of The Guardian Australia said Rice was escorted out of the chamber. “The stance is causing ripples among MPs (members of parliament). I heard one say the protest act was a ‘disgrace,'” he wrote. Outside parliament, other senators from Australian Greens joined protests, including Jordon Steele-John, David Shoebridge, and Barbara Pocock. “The Parliament is once more being used to launder the political reputation of those involved in serious human rights abuses. This time it is Bongbong Marcos, president of the Philippines,” Shoebridge wrote on X. “The deep, cruel legacy of the Marcos regimes – senior and junior – have crushed community, peasant, women’s, trade union and human rights activists in the Philippines. We marked this legacy today as he visited parliament,” Pocock added.

Marcos, whose Martial Law regime was considered among the darkest chapters of Philippine history. The Marcos patriarch was kicked out of office after the 1986 People Power Revolution, but the Marcos family has since rehabilitated its image through what critics describe as a systematic disinformation campaign. – Rappler.com",

The ex-congressman has yet to face other charges that have been lodged against him. In August, the Anti-Terrorism Council (ATC) designated Teves and 12 others as terrorists.

In a Tweet on her official account on Wednesday, September 21, that was later deleted, Marcos’ press secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said they were expected to discuss trade, investment and strengthening ties. A US source familiar with the plans also confirmed the meeting had been arranged. The office of Marcos and the Philippine foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for clarification on the meeting, which the White House has yet to announce. Marcos, the son and namesake of the late strongman who was overthrown in a 1986 public revolt, was elected president in May and has not been to the United States in 15 years. He is the subject of a contempt of a court order for refusing to cooperate with a Hawaii court that ruled the Marcos family must pay $2 billion of plundered wealth to victims of abuses under his father’s martial law era. Marcos Jr, who has rejected allegations his family stole from the treasury, has diplomatic immunity as head of state. In his speech at the general debate at the United Nations assembly on Tuesday, Marcos called on global leaders to reinvigorate the world economy, follow an international rules-based order and to urgently comply with their climate commitments. The Philippines is one of the biggest US allies in Asia and the two countries hold regular military exercises, part of a series of agreements that include a 70-year-old mutual defense treaty. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Following the bomb threats targeting government offices, Justice Secretary Boying Remulla ordered the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to conduct an investigation in collaboration with the Japan police attaché and other concerned law enforcement agencies. The office of the Department of Education (DepEd) in Bataan received a bomb threat via email on Monday morning, prompting the agency to suspend office work and instruct schools to hold asynchronous classes instead. Meanwhile, the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) said in a statement that it received a similar threat at around 10 am. DENR employees were immediately evacuated. The Department of Science and Technology (DOST), too, was disrupted by the threats. The sender of the bomb threats used the name Takahiro Karasawa, the same Japanese handle used by those who threatened the MRT-3 system last September 2023. The NBI noted that the name Karasawa was also associated with bomb threats in different countries. “This alarming pattern emphasizes the need for immediate and decisive action,” the NBI said in a statement. The justice department and the NBI said they were taking the matter “extremely seriously and will be dealt with accordingly, in full compliance with the law.” “The NBI is committed to conducting a thorough and impartial investigation, leaving no stone unturned in the pursuit of justice,” said NBI director Medardo de Lemos. It’s been exactly a week when some members of the House of Representatives reportedly received bomb threats. This raised security measures at the Batasang Pambansa complex. The PNP later described the threats at DepEd and DENR as hoaxes. “Upon thorough investigation in cooperation with the Philippine National Police, the information being circulated has been verified to be a hoax,” the DENR said in a statement. “The DENR calls for vigilant sobriety and advises everyone to immediately report suspicious activity to local authorities.” UPDATE. DENR confirms the bomb threat that hit their central office in Quezon City was a hoax. “The DENR calls for vigilant sobriety and advises everyone to immediately report suspicious activity to local authorities,” their statement read. Employees evacuated this… pic.twitter.com/ul54MPkf3L The Quezon City Police Department said there were “no signs of any bombs or any improvised explosive device” in the DENR central office. Bataan Governor Joet Garcia told the public to be vigilant of content they see online. “Pinabubulaanan din po ng mga awtoridad ang kumakalat na video sa social media na may natagpuang bomba sa Culis, Hermosa,” Garcia said in a post on Monday.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Almost two weeks after MT Princess Empress sank off Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) said they are still dealing with a Tier 2 oil spill. “Kapag more than 1 million na ang volume ng oil na involved sa spill ay i-elevate po natin sa Tier 3. And this one is less than 1 million, so right now, nasa Tier 2 pa po tayo, so Coast Guard pa po ang nag-o-oversee ng operations ng oil spill response operations ng government,” PCG Commandant Admiral Artemio Abu said on Saturday, March 11. (When the volume of the oil involved in the spill is more than 1 million, we will elevate it to Tier 3. And this one is less than 1 million, so right now, we are still at Tier 2, so it is the Coast Guard that oversees the oil spill response operations of the government.) Abu explained that the PCG follows the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCOP), which details the tiered response to oil spill situations at various levels: Abu said that although the Philippine government has not yet elevated its response to Tier 3, foreign coast guards and experts have already expressed their desire to help the PCG. The PCG chief also said numerous experts and coast guards of foreign countries – including a team from Japan – have offered to help in the ongoing cleanup operations. He said the team from Japan had already arrived in the country and had been briefed about the situation. Aside from tapping agencies such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and local government units, Abu noted that operating teams need to locate the exact location of the oil tanker to contain the spillage. As of Saturday, Abu said the Philippine government has yet to determine the percentage of oil cleaned up from the waters since their operations have begun. In its bulletin dated Friday, March 10, the University of the Philippines (UP) Marine Science Institute said the PCG had reported oil slick sightings and onshore deposition on the coast located in Taytay, Palawan. The UP institute also advised the northwestern part of Palawan to prepare and report any sightings of the oil slick and follow public guidance to prevent the spill’s harmful effects. MT Princess Empress capsized on February 28 while carrying an estimated 800,000 liters of industrial fuel oil. The ship was en route to Iloilo from Bataan when it capsized, causing the spillage of oil in waters nearby. Days later, on March 6, authorities said the sunken ship had been spotted around 7.5 nautical miles from Balisangan Point facing the town of Pola, Oriental Mindoro. At least 76 coastal barangays in nine towns in Oriental Mindoro have since been put under state of calamity. – Rappler.com",

Gacayan added that the BuCor official is awaiting the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) resolution before responding to allegations being thrown at him: “We have to await the resolution of our motion for inhibition to be sure where to file the counter-affidavit – DOJ or Office of the Ombudsman.” Zulueta’s legal counsel was pertaining to the motion filed by suspended BuCor Director General Gerald Bantag, which is seeking the inhibition of DOJ prosecutors from their cases. Bantag, on December 5, asked the prosecutors to stop handling the case. The BuCor official also surfaced in a Facebook post of Gacayan. The legal counsel told Rappler that the photos were taken on December 13, at around 12:57 pm, inside Gacayan’s law office in Baguio City. “I believe that like their earlier allegation against General Bantag that he is ‘in hiding’ is because the people in Baguio told him ‘MATAGO TAGO KA GENERAL,’ they are again misled this time,” Gacayan said in his post. “Just want to be clear about it. My client is not in hiding abroad or already dead!!!” Both Bantag and Zulueta, along with 10 persons deprived of liberty (PDL), are facing murder complaints over the deaths of Lapid and Jun Villamor, the alleged middleman in the Lapid case. Villamor was killed inside the New Bilibid Prison shortly after self-confessed gunman Joel Escorial surrendered. Bantag and Zulueta are being pinned as alleged masterminds in the case. Authorities said the two allegedly asked the PDLs to carry out the plan to kill Lapid. When the complaints were filed against the BuCor officials, authorities said Zulueta already went into hiding. On November 9, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin “Boying” Remulla said both Bantag and Zulueta remain in the country. Two days later, Bantag surfaced and retaliated against Remulla. The suspended corrections chief had urged the DOJ chief to resign and accused him of being marijuana user. Despite Bantag’s appearance, Zulueta remained a no-show. On November 22, Remulla said the authorities are “still presuming” that Zulueta is still alive. Zulueta also did not appear during the preliminary investigation of the case on November 23 and December 5. – Rappler.com",

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Philippine Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo is “confident” that the newly-launched trilateral relationship between the United States, Japan, and the Philippines can survive changes in leadership because it’s a relationship rooted in “similar views and interests.” “I’m confident because we share similar views and interests. I don’t think any administration would change that in the sense that if you read the opening, it’s that we’re all committed to free and open trade, free and open navigation, and commitment to democracy,” said Manalo in an interview for Rappler’s World View that aired Friday, May 3. Rappler editor-at-large Marites Vitug asked if the newly-formed three-way relationship would push through even if the United States, or even the Philippines, sees a change in leadership. On November 5, the United States will hold a presidential election. US President Joe Biden is gunning for a second term as the Democrat Party’s bet, while former president Donald Trump, twice-impeached in the past and facing several criminal charges, is seeking a return to the White House as the Republican Party’s nominee. The Philippines is set to hold a presidential election in 2028 yet. It’s under Biden and Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. that US and Philippine ties have grown exponentially – on hyper-drive, as Manalo himself has put it. The trilateral relationship was formalized during an April 11 leaders’ summit in the White House, hosted by the United States. Prior to the leaders’ meeting, top officials of the three countries – from trade to defense – had met at least once in the past. The relationship is seen as key for all three countries as China grows more aggressive in the region. Japan and the Philippines, both treaty-allies of the United States, have had to face Chinese aggression in the East China Sea and South China Sea, respectively. The Philippines and Japan are also strategic partners. Under Marcos, the Philippines has forged new ties and built on existing relationship with other nations, especially when it comes to security and the economy. But there are worries that US-Philippines bilateral ties, the new trilateral relationship, and the growing US-Japan-Philippines-Australia relationship could encounter hiccups should Trump return to Washington. “I can’t speculate on that, but at least, at this stage, as you could see from the vision statement, which essentially was almost 90% concerning economic cooperation and projects. The idea, of course, it’s important to ensure that some of these activities take off soon. And I think that can only be done through some form of regular meetings,” said Manalo, asked about those concerns. “I won’t say institutionalizing it, but I would say that there has to be a regular meeting, and of course, this should be done at expert levels or senior official levels. I think we are already beginning; in fact, we will be meeting on that, and it would involve not only the political agencies but even our, most especially, our economic departments — Department of Trade, Energy, and Natural Resources. So, all of these would have to come into play,” he added. Manalo has headed the Department of Foreign Affairs since day one of the Marcos administration.

    "article_body": "CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – The Philippine government is planning to build a naval base inside the 3,000-hectare Philippine Veterans Investment Development Corporation (PHIVIDEC) Industrial Estate in Tagoloan, Misamis Oriental. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, Misamis Oriental Governor Peter Unabia, and Cagayan de Oro 1st District Representative Lordan Suan unveiled the plan during a visit at Lumbia Air Base, one of the key sites under the Philippines’ Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement with the United States. Teodoro said the construction of the naval base would be Philippine-funded by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s Office of the President. The defense chief said the base would be manned by the Philippine Navy Fleet Command and would also serve as the logistics center for military forces in Mindanao. “Everything that is bulky and heavy to be carried by the [Philippine] Air Force would be shipped to the naval base,” Teodoro told reporters. Unabia said one of the reasons they chose PHIVIDEC Industrial Estate as the future site of the naval base is because of its good roads leading to other provinces in Mindanao. Teodoro said the naval base could complement the air operations in Lumbia Air Base in case of any major disasters. Teodoro, Unabia, and Suan also inspected the Lumbia Air Base that would house the planes and the headquarters of the 5th Philippine Air Force Fighter Wing. The base has also been approved as a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) warehouse “expected to support the rapid deployment of essential supplies in both field missions and HADR operations.” Teodoro said all of the construction in Lumbia are funded by the Philippine government as the US government has yet to provide its promised $3.7 million for the improvement of the base. “Secretary Teodoro emphasized the strategic importance of Lumbia as one of the country’s major operating bases to support various missions of the AFP in Mindanao,” the Department of National Defense said in a statement. “Continued basing developments, aside from the projects under EDCA, are seen to enhance Lumbia Air Base’s operational effectiveness, enabling it to accommodate air reserve forces and provide essential support to HADR operations during emergencies in the Mindanao Region,” it added. Aside from the would-be warehouse, Teodoro also inspected the locations of two other EDCA projects in the area. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "ILOCOS NORTE, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) in the Ilocos region has raised concerns about the potential psychological stress caused by firecrackers, especially illegal ones, during Christmas and New Year celebrations. During a press briefing on Monday, December 18, Dr. Joyce Suguitan, a DOH medical officer, warned against exploding firecrackers known as “Five stars,” “Judas’s belt,” “Atomic bomb,” “Giant bawang,” “Goodbye Philippines,” and “Boga” (improvised cannon). The DOH said these are the types of firecrackers that have historically caused the highest number of fireworks-related injuries (FWRI) in the region over the past three years. Suguitan said revelers should not only be concerned about minor to life-threatening physical injuries caused by firecrackers but also about the psychological trauma resulting in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders among individuals due to the explosions. She said the loss of body parts during the holiday season has also been impacting the mental health of FWRI victims. “This specifically happens when they lose body parts which are responsible for fine motor movements and those which are regularly used while working, or in our daily lives,” according to Suguitan. She said 44% of the FWRI victims in the region have suffered from hand injuries. Suguitan also warned of respiratory diseases caused by firecrackers emitting dangerous fumes and smoke, especially for those suffering from acute bronchitis and asthma. She said the number of FWRI cases in the Ilocos region has increased in the past three years. From 2022 to December 15 of this year, the DOH logged at least 100 FWRI incidents, with 74 in Pangasinan, 16 in La Union, seven in Ilocos Sur, and three in Ilocos Norte. The Police Regional Office-I has intensified its crackdown on the use of “Boga” among minors ahead of the Christmas and New Year’s revelry. The regional DOH office warned that children should stay away from fireworks this holiday season as it revealed those belonging to the five-to-nine-year-old age group suffered the most from FWRI. The health department said that 25% of the 60 FWRI recorded in 2022 comprised children from the age group. Most of them suffered from “blast and burn, and eye injury.” Public health officials asked residents to be creative instead by finding alternative ways to make loud noises to ensure safety this holiday season. The health department also urged residents on Monday to stay healthy and eat moderately this holiday season to avoid suffering from chronic diseases. Dr. Rheuel Bobis, DOH medical officer, said the holiday season resulted in an increase in cardiovascular cases in the region, with patients being rushed to hospitals because of elevated blood pressure and sugar levels. Bobis cautioned people, especially those suffering from comorbidities, against excessive consumption of fatty, salty, and sweet food. The increase in influenza-like illnesses this season also prompted the health department to encourage the public to keep the health protocols, particularly face mask-wearing, imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic. – Rappler.com",

(When the EUA came out, negotiations with the COVAX facility progressed, and they have committed that in three to four weeks, our vaccines will arrive.) Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines contain mRNA from the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 – just like the initial vaccine – and contain an mRNA component from the BA.4 or BA.5 Omicron variant. They were formulated to fight multiple variants of COVID-19 and protect against severe illness. COVAX, formally known as the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility, is a global collaboration for speeding up the development, manufacturing, and equitable distribution of new vaccines. Vergeire said prioritization will be implemented once the bivalent vaccines arrive in the country. “We are now prioritizing A1 (health workers) and A2 (senior citizens) population,” she said. Vergeire added that the DOH has already drafted guidelines for administering bivalent vaccines. The health department is awaiting signatures from its executive committee before releasing the guidelines through a memorandum. COVID-19 cases in the Philippines have been on a downward trend, with only 832 infections reported from February 20 to 26. The World Health Organization in January said COVID-19 continues to be a public health emergency of international concern, its highest form of alert. The pandemic is likely in a “transition point” that still requires careful management to “mitigate the potential negative consequences.” – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. extended the government’s deadline for jeepney drivers to consolidate themselves into cooperatives or corporations by another three months. “President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has approved Transport Secretary Jaime J. Bautista’s recommendation, granting an additional three months until April 30, 2024, for the consolidation of public utility vehicles,” the Presidential Communications Office said in a statement on Wednesday, January 24. “This extension is to give an opportunity to those who expressed intention to consolidate but did not make the previous cutoff,” it added. The consolidation deadline already lapsed on December 31, 2023, but unconsolidated public utility vehicles (PUVs) had been allowed to keep operating until January 31, 2024. Prior to the extension, over 1,900 jeepney and UV Express routes – where none of the PUV units traversing them formed a cooperative or corporation – were at risk of being wiped out by February 1. Marcos previously said there would be no extension in order to follow the “current timeline.” He insisted at the time that the government could not allow the minority to “cause further delays.” The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said over 73% of jeepneys nationwide have consolidated, although that number is reduced to 51% in Metro Manila. In a separate statement on Wednesday, LTFRB Chairman Teofilo Guadiz III called on jeepney operators and drivers “to take advantage of this opportunity provided by the President” for them to consolidate. Before and after the December 31 consolidation deadline, transport groups mounted demonstrations to protest the PUV Modernization Program. After consolidation, jeepney operators will be required to upgrade their vehicles, but drivers have been struggling to purchase pricey modern jeepneys. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The political parties of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Speaker Martin Romualdez have formalized an alliance for the 2025 midterm elections, a move that establishes the base of the administration’s senatorial ticket in next year’s vote. Marcos’ Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP) signed the agreement with Romualdez’s Lakas-CMD on Wednesday, May 8. PFP, according to its national president South Cotabato Governor Reynaldo Tamayo, is home to nearly half of the governors in the country. Lakas-CMD, where Romualdez is party president, is the most dominant bloc in the House, boasting 100 members that account for one-third of the chamber’s members. The alliance has also been eyeing to recruit other power blocs in Congress – Nacionalista Party, National Unity Party, and Nationalist People’s Coalition – into the fold, Marcos had said on May 1. Marcos has yet to announce the senatorial candidates that he would be backing. The PFP and Lakas-CMD were part of the UniTeam alliance in 2022, which catapulted Marcos and running mate Vice President Sara Duterte to the country’s top posts in a landslide election victory. Duterte’s regional party Hugpong ng Pagbabago was part of that alliance, but Tamayo was non-committal when asked whether HNP will be part of the administration coalition in 2025. Duterte has figured in apparent rifts with Speaker Romualdez and First Lady Liza Araneta Marcos, raising serious doubts on the formidability of the UniTeam alliance, heading to next year’s polls. Duterte remains part of Marcos’ Cabinet as education secretary, as the President insists on keeping her. The Vice President has also faced calls to resign as education secretary, amid the attacks of her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, and her siblings against Marcos. The midterm election also indicates public approval and the political influence of the incumbent president. A Pulse Asia Research Incorporated survey in March said Filipinos’ top concerns were controlling inflation, raising workers’ salaries, creating more jobs, and fighting corruption in government. – Rappler.com",

In an interview with the ABS-CBN News Channel on February 17, Defensor confirmed that they were already preparing for the trial but did not disclose which of the seven articles of impeachment he was assigned to handle. He said their evidence consists of documents and videos, which are publicly available. “I think we have strong evidence to secure a conviction, and that’s good because the evidence was already given to the public. The documents and the videos are all public. […] We don’t need to look for [other evidence] because it’s already there. The evidence is brought about by [Duterte] herself,” Defensor said. He also confirmed that private lawyers were assisting them in preparing for the impeachment trial. Defensor then alluded to the upcoming elections, stating that it was a chance for Filipinos to choose leaders with integrity. “I think this is a challenge for Filipinos to choose leaders who uphold integrity in government, who will show the highest ethical standards because the highest officials cannot set a bad example,” he added. Aside from Defensor, the House of Representatives appointed the following lawmakers as impeachment prosecutors on February 5: The impeachment trial will likely start after the 2025 midterm elections, as Senate President Francis Escudero has indicated a desire to commence after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s State of the Nation Address (SONA).

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Agriculture (DA) official who signed the alleged illegal sugar importation resolution has resigned from his post, Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angles said on Friday, August 12. In a statement, Angeles said Leocadio Sebastian, undersecretary for operations and chief of staff to the DA Secretary, resigned and apologized to agriculture chief and President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “I sincerely offer my apologies, Your Excellency, for my having approved Sugar Order No. 4 on your behalf, and through the authority you have vested upon me… I take accountability and responsibility for its consequences,” the agriculture official said in his letter quoted by Angeles. Sugar Order No. 4 of the Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) approved the importation of 300,000 metric tons of sugar after being “signed” by the President, who also chairs the SRA. However, Angeles clarified that the President did not sign the resolution. The Press Secretary earlier explained that Sebastian was “not authorized” to sign the document on behalf of Marcos. She also described the resolution as “illegal.” In his letter to the President, Sebastian wished to be relieved of “delegated” tasks that go with both of his assignments. “Thus, I humbly offer to be relieved of my delegated authorities and the assignments and responsibilities in my capacity as Chief of Staff and Undersecretary of the Department of Agriculture.” Although Angeles used the word “resign” to refer to Agriculture official’s action, Sebastian did not use the word in his letter. Angeles added, in her statement, that the investigation is ongoing to determine if there was “malice” or “negligence” involved in the issue. “In such a case, if such findings are made, then the only determination left will be how many heads are going to roll.” Sebastian’s resignation came two days after he went to Malacañang on Wednesday, August 10. The President had informally spoken to the besieged agriculture official. Three days after Sebastian’s exit from the agriculture department, Marcos accepted the resignation of SRA chief Hermenegildo Serafica, effective immediately. SRA board member Ronald Beltran also tendered his resignation citing “health reasons.” Beltran sent his resignation to Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez via email on August 14. Beltran, in his letter, said his resignation was “without prejudice” to the ongoing probe into the resolution. The board member also noted that he had presumed to exit the post on July 1, when his term expired but that he was summoned back to the board after he was told he would stay in a “holdover capacity.” The Palace earlier issued two circulars authorizing the extension of terms and designation of officers-in-charge for certain posts pending a new appointee from the Marcos administration. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) will retain Gabriel Go as head of its Special Operations Group-Strike Force, despite recent scrutiny over a viral video showing him scolding a police officer for illegal parking. The MMDA said on Monday, April 7, that Go will undergo a five-day training mentorship coaching on traffic management, focusing on leadership, courtesy, and discipline and with special attention on stress and anger management. MMDA chairman Don Artes said that the training is “not a form of punishment, but more for his self-improvement.” The MMDA’s Legal and Legislative Affairs Staff also gave Go a warning for “simple discourtesy with stern warning that the commission of the same in the future will be dealt with more severely.” In light of the recent incident, the MMDA reminded its traffic enforcers to stay calm and patient when faced with unnecessary arguments from traffic violators, to handle the situation politely, and to always act professionally while on duty. Go recently apologized to Quezon City Police Captain Erik Felipe, who owned one of the motorcycles that were illegally parked in front of the local police station during a road clearing operation in Barangay Teachers Village East. “I sincerely apologize to you. It was not my intention for such an unfortunate incident and interaction to occur,” Go said in a press conference at the Department of the Interior and Local Government-National Police Commission building on Thursday, April 3. Despite his apology, Felipe on the same day filed a cyber libel complaint against Go and the blogger who posted the video. Following the incident, the MMDA has also started prohibiting its employees and private individuals from vlogging, recording, or posting videos of its operations. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines has requested Indonesia to pardon jailed Filipino Mary Jane Veloso, who has been incarcerated since 2010 over drug trafficking charges. In a statement released via state-run PTV on Tuesday, September 6, the Department of Foreign Affairs said Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo on September 4 asked of his Indonesian counterpart that the Filipina be granted executive clemency. The meeting between Manalo and Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi happened on the sidelines of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr’s state visit to Indonesia. In a separate taped video statement, Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said Marsudi told the Philippine delegation that they would consult their Ministry of Justice. Veloso was arrested in Yogyakarta in 2010 after she unwittingly brought with her a suitcase packed with over 2.6 kilograms of heroin. Within 6 months of her arrest, Veloso was sentenced to the death penalty. She has requested for clemency before but was rejected in 2015. It was that rejection – and the threat of execution – that first turned Mary Jane Veloso into a household name in the Philippines. The Philippine government then, led by the late Benigno Aquino III, held last-minute talks – with the late president even breaking protocol – to stop Veloso’s slated execution by firing squad. Marsudi was also the official whom Aquino himself spoke to in a bid to save Veloso’s life. The DFA, in their statement, said they are in constant contact with Veloso, who is represented by Indonesian law firm on retainer by the Philippine Embassy there. She is currently detained at the Wonosari Women’s Penitentiary in Yogyakarta. – Rappler.com",

The Department of Agriculture (DA) and the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) had administered 28,000 ASF vaccine doses out of the 160,000 available doses, according to DA spokesman Arnel de Mesa. “[T]hey were requested by the Secretary (DA Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr) na within April dapat magkaroon na ng commercial approval from FDA itong bakuna na ito galing sa Vietnam,” De Mesa said in a press briefing Wednesday, March 19. (They were requested by the Secretary that they should obtain FDA’s commercial approval for the Vietnam-made vaccines within April.) BAI conducted controlled vaccinations in 29 farms across Luzon. The FDA had issued a certificate of product registration for the monitored release of vaccines. They have yet to green light the commercial use of the vaccines. 51 hogs died after vaccination, but De Mesa maintained that the pigs are generally showing positive response to the vaccine as only a small portion of the population died. “Based on the initial report na pinadala nila, effective siya… based doon sa result noong completed and ongoing na pagbabakuna,” said De Mesa. (Based on the initial report the BAI sent regarding the completed and ongoing inoculation, the vaccines are effective.) Active ASF cases have dwindled, down to 39 barangays in seven regions as of Friday, March 14 from 66 barangays recorded as of the end of February.

It has become a global concern after outbreaks were detected in many countries, including China, Vietnam, and Korea.

The cash grants were given in response to the challenges faced by small rice retailers following President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s order for price ceilings on the essential national staple. Marcos Jr., who serves as the head of the Department of Agriculture (DA), issued Executive Order No. 39 on August 31, setting price limits at P41 per kilo for regular milled rice and P45 per kilo for well-milled rice. The DTI said 171 small rice retailers received the cash aid during the second round of the distribution of assistance to micro rice retailers at the Zamboanga del Norte Convention Center in Estaka, Dipolog City, on Tuesday, September 12. The DTI said 86 beneficiaries from Zamboanga del Sur were given cash assistance through the DSWD earlier. The beneficiaries were those with valid business licenses from the DTI’s Business Permits and Licensing Office and those who were selling regular milled and well-milled rice. The recipients also included retailers listed by the DTI as sole proprietors or registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as partnerships or corporations engaged in the sale of regular milled and well-milled rice. DTI-Zamboanga Peninsula Assistant Director Maridel Dengal said, “DTI is committed to supporting the national government in helping affected micro rice retailers… Our teams are working hard on a day-to-day basis to efficiently distribute assistance to all beneficiaries.” In Cagayan de Oro, Councilor George Goking said there was a need for an “enhanced” executive order to include more rice industry players in the government’s aid program. Goking said the bigger rice industry players were adversely affected by Marcos Jr.’s price ceiling, too. He also sought regulatory powers for the National Food Authority (NFA). “While the executive order was necessary to prevent price manipulations, Councilor Goking is seeing some problems that need to be addressed by an enhanced or expanded EO,” Goking said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is set to acquire five more 97-meter patrol vessels for Phase III of a decade-old marine safety capability improvement project funded by Japan. Philippine Foreign Secretary Enrique Manalo and Japanese Ambassador Endo Kazuya led on Friday, May 17, the signing and exchange of diplomatic notes for the project. The acquisition of the five vessels and the development of support facilities is valued at over 64.38 billion yen (around P23.85 billion), according to the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA). The 97-meter multi-role response vessels (MRRVs) will be among the largest and most modern in the PCG’s fleet. Currently, two are in operation – the lead of its class, the BRP Teresa Magbanua, and the BRP Melchora Aquino. Practically all of the PCG’s newest ships are Japan-made and funded through loans from the Philippines’ strategic partner. Its 10 44-meter MRRVs were delivered between 2016 and 2018, and the first two 97-meter vessels were delivered in 2022. The 44-meter ships, named after lighthouses in the Philippines, were made by Japan Marine United, while the 97-meter vessels were made by Mitsubishi Shipbuilding. “This occasion signifies not only the deepening of bilateral relations between the Philippines and Japan but also underscores our unwavering commitment to enhance our maritime safety capabilities for the benefit of our nation and the broader maritime community,” said Manalo during Friday’s event. “The additional grant is expected to contribute to improving maritime safety in the Philippines by improving the capacity of the Philippine Coast Guard to efficiently conduct maritime rescue, law enforcement, and other operations,” said the Japanese embassy in Manila in a release. The loan for Phase III of the project is payable over 40 years, with a 10-year grace period and an interest rate of 0.3% yearly and 0.2% for consulting services. The PCG’s Japan-made vessels are crucial in its patrols not just in the tension-rife West Philippine Sea, but across the country’s waters. The PCG conducts regular maritime patrols, as well as resupply missions to outposts in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone, among others. According to the DFA, Japan is the Philippines’ top bilateral official development assistance partner “with its long history of support for Philippine development priorities spanning infrastructure, health, human resources, agriculture, education, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief.” – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of National Defense (DND) said on Saturday, April 15, that the Philippines-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) will not be used to meddle in China’s affairs in relation to Taiwan, contrary to the suggestion of China’s envoy to Manila. “The Department of National Defense takes exception to the statement of Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian that the Philippines is meddling in the internal affairs of China concerning Taiwan,” DND spokesperson Arsenio Andolong said in a statement on Saturday, April 15. In a statement on Friday, April 14, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines Huang Xilian advised the Philippines to “unequivocally oppose” Taiwan’s independence. He claimed that the Philippines was “stoking the fire” by offering military bases near Taiwan Strait that can be accessed by the United States under the EDCA. Andolong, in his statement, added that the Philippines observes the One China Policy and adheres to the Association of Southeast Asian Nation’s principle of noninterference in dealing with issues in the region. Under the One China Policy, Taiwan is an “inalienable part of China,” and that the People’s Republic of China is the only legal government representing the country. The defense official also explained that the Philippines’ primary concern is the safety of Filipinos living and working in Taiwan. He added that the DND “deems it prudent to prepare for any contingencies” to ensure Filipinos’ safety amid the ongoing tension in the strait. Andolong also defended the additional EDCA sites in the country, saying that the defense department aims to improve the country’s defense capabilities through available means. “The implementation of EDCA is not directed against any country and is in line with our efforts to modernize our alliance and enable collective defense and peace, promote our national interest, protect our national sovereignty, ensure the livelihood and welfare of our fisherfolk and communities, and enhance our capability to respond to emergencies and disasters, as well as provide humanitarian assistance,” he said. Jonathan Malaya, National Security Council (NSC)’s spokesperson, also clarified on Saturday that the country has no intention to interfere in the tension in Taiwan and “will not allow itself to be used by other countries to interfere in the said issue.” Malaya said National Security Adviser Eduardo Año already clarified that the EDCA sites are meant to develop the Armed Forces of the Philippines’ capabilities. Malaya added that Año already assured China that the sites will not enable offensive operations against China or to interfere in the Taiwan issue. “The identified EDCA sites are Philippine bases which we want to further develop based on the requirements for strategic basing and development of the AFP. These were not US-dictated but identified by our armed forces,” the NSC spokesperson said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. himself had assured China that no Philippine military base would be used for “offensive” actions. Amid the ongoing tension in Taiwan Strait, China held military exercises on April 9 after Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen met with US House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy. China even simulated a scenario of striking Taiwan. – Rappler.com",

Last year, incumbent BuCor chief Gregorio Catapang Jr. said Bilibid gang leaders Escopete of Batang Cebu and Usman of Batang Mindanao gave sworn affidavits detailing how Bantag allegedly stabbed them. The gang leaders said they were summoned by Bantag at the BuCor’s administration building, along with other commanders of the Maximum Security Compound of Bilibid, at around 11:30 am on February 1, 2022. Bantag, who was then allegedly under the influence of alcohol, “tortured them and inflicted serious physical injuries” on them. Usman said Bantag allegedly stabbed his palm using a double-bladed knife. As for Escopete, Bantag allegedly slashed his shirt using a Kris knife and pointed it on his chest, “causing it to bleed.” Aside from these to be-filed charges, Bantag and Zulueta also face charges over the death of broadcaster Percy Lapid and Jun Villamor, the alleged middleman who contacted people to order Lapid’s killing. Muntinlupa and Las Piñas City courts already issued arrest warrants against the two in relation the alleged crime. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MARAWI, Philippines – Thousands of families displaced during the 2017 Marawi Siege are facing the prospect of eviction from their temporary shelters because lease agreements between the government and landowners will expire starting in November. Marawi City Mayor Majul Gandamra said the government hurriedly signed the lease agreements with the landowners during an emergency, resulting from the five-month fighting between government forces and the Daesh-inspired Maute Group five years ago. “We needed land for the internally displaced quickly. It was not easy to buy land,” Gandamra said. He said when the government entered into agreements with the landowners in 2017, officials did not foresee the Marawi housing program being slowed down. “When we entered into agreements with the landowners, the problem of housing for the internally displaced people was expected to be solved within five years. We did not expect it to last this long,” he said. The National Housing Authority (NHA) and other government agencies are negotiating with the landowners for extensions, he said. Some 4,000 families living in temporary shelters in these villages would face eviction unless the government and landowners forge new agreements again. Gandamra said the land lease agreements covered 20 hectares in Barangay Sagonsongan, 20 hectares in Barangay Boganga, five hectares in Barangay Dulay, and three hectares in Barangay Patani. All the agreements have five-year tenures, which would end next month up to the first quarter of next year. “Those in Barangay Sagonsongan would be the first to be affected. Around 1,300 families in all,” Gandamra said. He said some 1,800 families living in temporary shelters would also be affected in Barangay Boganga, and another 500 families in Barangay Dulay until February 23, 2023. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said over 25,300 families or 127,000 people were displaced in the 2017 fighting. In an interview with Rappler, Drieza Lininding, chairman of the Marawi rehabilitation monitor Moro Consensus Group, said there were still about 5,000 families living in temporary shelters five years after the Marawi Siege. Lininding said many other displaced families relocated elsewhere. “They want to return, but the government won’t allow them yet,” he said. Poor planning and lack of foresight on the part of the government, he said, were factors for the delays. Lininding said the Marcos administration has not even activated the Moro Compensation Board to ensure that those adversely affected by the Marawi Siege are given reparation funds based on a law approved before then-president Rodrigo Duterte stepped down. He said many of the displaced families would not be able to rebuild if they don’t get compensated by the government because “they lost everything” in 2017. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the Philippines’ approach to its illegal drug problem “has changed significantly,” nearly two years after he took the reins from Rodrigo Duterte, whose anti-narcotics campaign was marked by thousands of deaths and international disapproval. Marcos zeroed in on the subject after he was asked by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz about his administration’s efforts to address the drug menace, according to a report from state-run Philippine News Agency. He claimed that the Philippine National Police has been reorganized, and that some erring cops have been put behind bars. “It’s a big problem, but our approach has changed significantly,” Marcos told Scholz during their meeting in Berlin on Tuesday, March 12. “I am diametrically opposed to handling the drug problem in that way, by confrontation, by violence,” he added. “It really requires so much deeper understanding on the problem and the much deeper solution. So, yes, I think that we are also progressing when it comes to that.” The Duterte administration logged 6,252 individuals killed in police operations under its drug war. Human rights groups, however, put the number at up to 30,000, including victims of vigilante-style killings. Drug-related killings, however, did not go to a complete halt under the Marcos administration. The Dahas project of the UP Third World Studies Center said it has monitored at least 342 drug-related killings in the first year of the Marcos presidency, including 115 killed during anti-illegal drug operations by state agents. The human rights abuses under Marcos’ predecessor was widely condemned by the international community. Germany was, in fact, among the many countries that flagged Duterte’s anti-narcotics campaign during its peak. Duterte is also being investigated by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for the bloody drug war, but Marcos, for the most part, has said his administration will not cooperate with the probe. He reiterated this during his meeting with Scholz, who asked about the status of the tribunal’s investigation. “It’s really a question of jurisdiction and we have our own investigations and we’re capable of conducting our own investigations and, so we are, we are continuing to do so,” President Marcos told Scholz, according to a press release from Malacañang. “But as a matter of principle, it is very difficult for the Philippines to accept that an outside court will, shall I say, dictate to our policemen, ‘who they will investigate, who they will arrest and who will say, that hey, because we don’t need that advice’,” he added. Marcos won the presidency in 2022 with Mr. Duterte’s daughter – Vice President Sara Duterte – as his running mate. The two political families have deep ties that bind, although the relationship between the former president and his successor has taken a turn for the worse in recent months. Critics say the Marcos administration’s continued disengagement from the ICC highlights his doublespeak on human rights. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benhur Abalos admitted on Friday, September 2, that there might have been a “miscommunication” between him and Cebu City Mayor Mike Rama over the deferment of a local policy that lifts the mask mandate. Abalos first announced in a statement and during a House hearing on Thursday, September 1, that Rama agreed to put on hold the enforcement of his executive order that makes face mask-wearing optional in Cebu City until Abalos discusses the matter with the country’s COVID-19 interagency task force (IATF). Rama, however, reportedly told the local press later on Thursday that he would not withdraw the policy. In a statement, Abalos acknowledged he and Rama may not have been on the same page. “There seems to be a miscommunication as to what Mayor Rama and I discussed regarding the issue. I respect the statement of Mayor Rama, and I fully intend to keep communication lines open to give him the opportunity to explain his position and basis behind the enactment of the city-wide order,” he said. “Notwithstanding, I remain firm and steadfast in my commitment to raise this issue to the IATF and make Cebu City a pilot city that will help assess the lifting of masking protocols in outdoor areas and wide open spaces,” he added. Executive Order No. 5, which Rama signed on Wednesday, August 31, revoked the long-standing coronavirus-driven policy on the mandatory wearing of face masks in indoor and outdoor public spaces. He had cited the city’s successful vaccination drive and low number of COVID-19 cases for making the move. He had also informed Abalos about the order before he signed it, Rama had said. Department of Health Officer-in-Charge Maria Rosario Vergeire had said that the Cebu City government did not consult her agency, and insisted that “one particular place cannot be implementing its own protocol, while the rest of the country is implementing another protocol because we have porous borders.” In an interview with state television PTV on Thursday, Rama insisted the EO on the optional face-mask policy simply reiterated the current policy. “I don’t like the DOH saying we should consult them,” the mayor said in a mix of English and Filipino. “The Local Government Code states that they should consult us.” “I didn’t tell people not to wear face masks, just that it’s non obligatory,” he added. “In open spaces, you’re not required to use face masks.” Rama also found limiting Abalos’ idea to make Cebu City the pilot implementer of the optional wearing of face mask policy. “It can’t be only Cebu City; it should be the whole One Cebu,” he said. As of Thursday, Cebu City has 305 active COVID-19 cases. – Rappler.com",

The appointment, dated December 9, was coursed through the Department of Finance, which supervises the government-owned bank. Tinga took his oath on Thursday, December 22, in Malacañang before Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, who was a former SC chief justice. The DBP is the country’s premier government financial institution for the national government’s key development programs, among them, the development of economic zones and the funding of infrastructure projects. Marcos and his congressional allies were most recently pushing for a sovereign wealth fund named Maharlika Investment Fund to be financed by both the DBP and the Landbank of the Philippines, another government-owned bank. Tinga, 83, was SC associate justice from 2003 to 2009 but his life has not just been entirely tied to the judicial bench. He was also a former member of the House of Representatives for the lone district of Taguig-Pateros from 1987 to 1998. In the 2022 polls, he tried again to be part of Congress by being the first nominee of the newly-created Silbi Partylist, but the group failed to secure even a single seat. Tinga was also dean of the University of the East College of Law from 1989 to 1993, and from 2017 to 2018. – Rambo Talabong/Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – For the 11th year, the Philippines remained the deadliest country in Asia for environmental defenders, according to the latest report from Global Witness released on Monday, September 9. Seventeen environmental defenders were killed in the Philippines in 2023, the report said, out of the 196 killed around the world. This brings the number of such killings in the Philippines to 298 since Global Witness started counting in 2012. Cases in the Philippines now make up 64% of the recorded environmental killings in Asia, and placing it third in the world with the most number of killings. The murders of the activists were linked to the mining, fishing, logging, agribusiness, infrastructure, and hydropower industries. The report came with an acknowledgement of defenders murdered with a list and the dates of their death. South African human rights activist Nonhle Mbuthuma said in her foreword, “This report shows that in every region of the world, people who speak out and call attention to the harm caused by extractive industries – like deforestation, pollution and land grabbing – face violence, discrimination and threats.” Here are the Filipino environmental defenders acknowledged by Global Witness: A disproportionate number of those killed were indigenous people, the report noted. Even relatives did not escape attacks. A third of such attacks had been made against women relatives. The Philippines follows four Latin American countries — Colombia, Brazil, Honduras, Mexico — in the list with most killings. The killings of Filipino environmental defenders recorded last year does not paint the whole picture. According to environmental network Kalikasan’s own monitoring, there had been 21 killings and 11 abductions involving 19 environmental defenders in 2023. Those who are not killed face a grim living reality: attacks, abductions, trumped-up charges, and other forms of harassment. Jonila Castro, advocacy officer of Kalikasan, said that the Marcos administration has “failed to stem the tide of violence against those protecting our environment and natural resources” “Environmental defenders are being red-tagged, harassed, and murdered with impunity,” said Castro. Castro herself was abducted by the military in 2023 in Bataan, together with fellow activist Jhed Tamano. Castro and Tamano’s abduction story and advocacy campaigns in Manila Bay were featured in the report. They said that since their release, they continue to be at the receiving end of threats and intimidation tactics. Even their families and colleagues were not spared. While threats impeded them from fully returning to communities, Castro and Tamano continue to work on campaigns in Manila Bay where reclamation projects and a recent oil spill pose possible harm to the ecosystem. “For us, the experience has been transformative, but perhaps not in the way it was intended. Rather than leaving this work and finding ourselves an easy job, this has renewed our resolve to continue protecting our planet,” the two shared in the report. – Rappler.com",

The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and the Land Transportation Office (LTO) announced on Friday, June 7, its OFW Driver’s License Renewal Program, where OFWs will be able to access an online platform for license renewal. LTO chief Vigor Mendoza said that the office is looking to propose a pilot run beginning in July, which may run on the LTO’s online portal. “We will launch [the program]. And through that, they will put in all their necessary data, which will go to the LTO. The licenses will be printed here in the Philippines, but through the portal, they will choose whichever courier they want to use, and the courier will send it to them,” Mendoza said in a mix of English and Filipino. Some of the renewal requirements include a valid license that has not been expired for more than two years, and biometrics capturing. Mendoza said the Department of Transportation plans to work with the Department of Foreign Affairs to share data on biometrics, since all OFWs give biometrics when applying for passports. The LTO said the portal will cater to renewal first for OFWs, and then would “explore” other services later on. At present, the LTO’s Land Transportation Management System has an option to renew OFW driver’s licenses. However, the applicants still need to return to the country to claim them at an LTO branch. Mendoza was unable to pinpoint exact figures indicating demand for this service among Filipinos abroad, but said that it would be especially important for Filipinos working as drivers in other countries. The Philippines has reciprocity agreements with various countries, which allows Filipinos to easily apply for local licenses by showing their Philippine cards. The LTO struggled with a months-long shortage of plastic cards. But Mendoza on Friday said the office was ready to take on the possible deluge of online applications from OFWs. “We have enough [plastic cards]. In fact, our planning is for 2025 already…. The planning projection is more than enough to cater for 2024. We’re expecting a surplus for 2025, first two months. But with this project, we’re already budgeting around a million cards for this,” said Mendoza. The program announcement was part of the activities at the DMW for National Migrant Workers’ Day on Friday. – Rappler.com",

The decision to buy the helicopters was approved last month by former President Rodrigo Duterte, before their terms in office ended on June 30, the news agency reported. “We could face sanctions,” the news agency quoted Lorenzana as saying in an interview. Philippine government officials were not immediately available for comment. US security officials were aware of the decision and could offer similar heavy-lift helicopters for the Philippine military, Lorenzana said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – During an event the government described as a rare meeting among sugar stakeholders in Malacañang on Wednesday, May 17, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. raised the possible revival of the defunct Philippine Sugar Corporation (PhilSuCor). Established by his namesake and late father, the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos in 1983, PhilSuCor’s primary objective was to finance “the acquisition, rehabilitation and/or expansion of sugar mills, refineries, and other related facilities.” During that period, critics described the PhilSucor as among the institutions which perpetuated the monopoly of the sugar industry by Roberto Benedicto, a fraternity brother and classmate of the Marcos patriarch at the UP Law school. “One of the suggestions that came up during the meeting was to revitalize PhilSuCor,” said Marcos. “Titingnan natin kung ano ‘yung mga pagbabago para makapag-adjust tayo dito sa sitwasyon natin ngayon and continue their work in providing assistance sa ating mga farmers, sa ating mga farmer groups,” he added. (Let’s see what new things we can implement so we can adjust to our present situation and continue their assistance for farmers, groups.) In 2018, former president Rodrigo Duterte ordered PhilSuCor’s abolition, as it was deemed redundant with the existence of the Sugar Regulatory Administration. The Presidential Communications Office said the gathering of sugar industry stakeholders was the ‘first in a long time,’ though the government information agency did not provide details to back up this claim. Present during the meeting were Manuel Lamata of the United Sugar Producers Federation, Cornelio Toreja of Luzon Federation of Sugar Producers Inc., Petie Sumagaysay of Kabankalan-Ilog Planters Association, Lance Gokongwei of Universal Robina Corp., and Gareth McGeown, representing the domestic traders of Coca-Cola. Executive Secretary Lucas P. Bersamin, Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Juan Ponce Enrile, and SRA acting administrator Pablo Luis S. Azcona were also present. Agriculture Senior Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban attended the Malacañang meeting too. Panganiban was recently under fire for skipping the Senate probe on May 8 on the sugar fiasco. Panganiban said he was on official mission in Washington during that time. During the meeting, Marcos and stakeholders also talked about the importation schedule of 150,000 metric tons (MT) of sugar and how the country should open the importation to all traders. Last Monday, May 15, Marcos approved the additional importation of sugar to stabilize prices. The country needs to import more sugar to cover the 3.1 million MT demand, as local production and approved imports were not enough. The sugar industry is reeling from a crisis and alleged cartels. Since last year, the SRA has seen executives step down in light of the sugar import mess. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The graft complaint filed against executives of African Swine Fever (ASF) vaccine distributor KPP Powers Commodities Incorporated (KPP) is “baseless,” the company’s legal counsel told Rappler on Friday, August 23. The complaint, filed by journalist Fermin Diaz before the Office of the Ombudsman on Wednesday, August 21, alleged the collusion of three KPP executives with incumbent and former officials of the Department of Agriculture (DA), Bureau of Animal Industry, and Food and Drug Administration over the import and trials of Vietnam-made AVAC vaccines developed to fight ASF. KPP’s legal counsel, Reynaldo Robles, said in a statement that the registration of the AVAC vaccine was in accordance with the government’s regulatory requirements. “The vaccine has undergone extensive farm and commercial trials under the strict supervision and oversight of the government regulators, and its Certificate of Product Registration was approved based on its own merits, on basis of the result of excellent results of said trials and KPP Powers’ regulatory submissions,” KPP said. Diaz’s filing of the graft complaint only validates their claim that he was “impelled by malice and ulterior motives” when the journalist went to press with a story on the AVAC vaccine, the agribusiness firm said. KPP earlier filed a libel case against Diaz over the story. The case is now pending before a Regional Trial Court in Quezon City. “As regards the Ombudsman case he filed, the same is completely baseless and is clearly intended for the sole purpose of harassing KPP and its officers, and we are confident that the same will ultimately be dismissed by the Office of the Ombudsman for utter lack of merit,” KPP said. The AVAC vaccine is the first commercially available vaccine against ASF. The government is poised to use 10,000 doses of the Vietnam-made vaccines, availed under emergency procurement, for controlled trials under monitored release. The Philippines has seen a rise in active ASF cases in recent months, with Batangas declaring some towns under a state of calamity. In the past week, the DA has seized trucks of hogs with false paperwork. KPP, which is based in Quezon City, imports and distributes feeds and animal nutrition products for livestock and poultry industry. Its CEO, Pinky Pe Tobiano, is one of the respondents in the Ombudsman complaint together with KPP managing director Juan Carlos Robles and two other KPP executives. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The proposed P5.768-trillion budget of the Marcos administration for fiscal year 2024 reached the House plenary on Tuesday, September 19, after nearly a month-long series of debates at the committee level. The deliberations will last until next week, as the House commits to pass the spending plan before Congress takes a month-long break on September 30. “The timely passage of this measure is not just an obligation but our solemn responsibility,” said House appropriations panel chairperson Zaldy Co. Co sponsored House Bill No. 8980 on the floor, saying that the budget has a “special emphasis” on legacy specialty hospitals, housing for the poor, and food self-sufficiency. “The key priorities of the 2024 General Appropriations Act are still education, healthcare, infrastructure, social services and social welfare and many others,” he said. Here’s the breakdown of the budget allotted for priority sectors: The Marcos administration’s request for P10.1 billion in confidential and intelligence funds hurdled the appropriations committee last week. Confidential and intelligence funds are much more difficult to audit, because they are exempted from standard procedures of the Commission on Audit. The parliamentary courtesy extended by the House leadership to the Office of the President (OP) and the Office of the Vice President (OVP) sparked criticism, because it meant opposition lawmakers had no chance to interrogate Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin and Vice President Sara Duterte on the use of the secret funds. It also turned out that the OVP’s confidential fund in 2022 came from the contingent fund of that year’s GAA, transferred to her office by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) upon approval of the OP. Critics said the release was unconstitutional, since the power to appropriate public funds lies in Congress. “Our plenary debates will last seven days. Many things can still happen,” House appropriations vice chairperson Stella Quimbo said on Monday, September 18, when asked whether there could still be changes to the request on confidential funds in the House. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – After promising to travel less in his second year as President – and managing to stay put in the Philippines from February to April, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr is set to fly to the United Kingdom to attend the coronation of King Charles on May 6. His attendance was first confirmed by Teodoro Locsin Jr, the Philippines’ Ambassador to the UK. Charles and his wife, Queen Consort Camilla, will be crowned at the Westminster Abbey. This will be the first coronation of a British monarch to happen in the 21st century. Charles’ mother, the late Queen Elizabeth, was crowned in 1953. In a statement late Monday, April 3, the Presidential Communications Office said: “President Ferdinand R. Marcos Jr. and First Lady Louise Araneta-Marcos have accepted the invitation to attend the coronation of His Majesty King Charles III and Her Majesty The Queen Consort at Westminster Abbey on Saturday, 6th May, 2023.” Marcos and the First Lady will also attend the reception in Buckingham Palace on May 5, or the day before the coronation. Quoting Locsin, ABS-CBN News said Marcos would “leave at once” because he was also attending the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Summit. The 42nd ASEAN Summit and its side events are scheduled from May 9 to 11 in Jakarta, Indonesia. According to the BBC, Charles’ coronation “formalizes the monarch’s role as the head of the Church of England and marks the transfer of their title and powers.” Guests include the Royal Family, officials from the UK government, other heads of state, and other royals from around the world, according to the BBC. ABS-CBN quoted Locsin as claiming Charles and Marcos “know each other because they used to play polo together.” Marcos studied in the UK and exited Oxford University with a “special diploma” in 1978, when his father and namesake, the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, was still in power. The President’s three sons, including newbie House leader Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Marcos, studied in the United Kingdom. Charles earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Cambridge in 1970, making him the first heir to the throne with a university degree. The visit to the UK and Indonesia would be Marcos’ fourth and fifth trips overseas in 2023, and his ninth and 10th since assuming office. (We count the trips according to the number of times he exits the country, not the number of countries visited.) Marcos is also set to depart for state visit to Paris and the US at least one time in 2023 to attend the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit. Marcos has been criticized for his many trips abroad, which he has justified by claiming the Philippines stands to benefit from foreign investments. While the Marcos administration has repeatedly announced figures related to pledges made during these trips, an actual investment has yet to materialize. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "BAGUIO, Philippines – Education officials in Baguio rejected claims that more than half of school children in the city were found to be struggling to read and write in English. This came as a response to Councilor Fred Bagbagen’s call for Department of Education (DepEd) officials to participate in the discussions about the state of Baguio’s education. He sounded alarm bells over data that supposedly showed that only 40% of children aged 9-12 in the city can read and write in English. Bagbagen cited a supposed study in 2020 about learning issues faced by the country and the city, particularly in terms of English proficiency in elementary and secondary-level learners. The councilor attributed the data to a study published in the Development Research News (DRN), Volume 38, that claimed that senior high school students struggle to write basic sentences in English. The publication of the Philippine Institute of Development Studies (PIDS), however, did not specify the methodology, sample population, location, or the number of non-English-proficient senior high school students. The PIDS serves as a socioeconomic policy think tank of the government. Baguio City Schools Division superintendent Federico Martin said Bagbagen got it all wrong, adding that the supposed data did not reflect the current and actual situation on the ground in Baguio. He said the department conducted a cursory investigation and found that Bagbagen’s data and premise were incorrect. Based on Bagbagen’s concerns, the city council had sought an official statement from the DepEd in the Cordillera Administrative Region. The local legislature, through Resolution 098-2023, also sought a study with recommendations about the actual education situation in the city. DepEd-Baguio Education Program supervisor Marilyn Api-It said the claim about a 40% English literacy and proficiency rate among Baguio children was a flawed premise. Api-It said there were no recent data to support Bagbagen’s concern because the Philippine Informal Reading Inventory (Phil-IRI), usually conducted annually, was not conducted during previous years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Besides, Api-It added, the Phil-IRI was for spotting children in need of intervention in reading and did not necessarily indicate proficiency level. “The Phil-IRI… will be completed in June or July. So, there is no such data yet,” Api-it said. Pre-COVID-19 reports, however, indicate that eight out of every 100 students dropped out, and were unable to complete 6th grade and enter high school education in the city. Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong attributed the problem to poverty and lack of access to tools required for blended learning methods. Magalong said immediate action was needed so that children would not be hampered by poor literacy as they grow up. Local officials said they were also concerned about the effects of the Mother Tongue-based Multilingual Education (MTBMLE) on the English proficiency of students which Baguio Representative Mark Go opposed in Congress in 2020. The DepEd in the region said fears about the program causing poor English literacy were unfounded because there was no documentation to prove or disprove allegations of its negative effects. – Rappler.com Angel Castillo is an Aries Rufo Journalism fellow.",

Sustained winds of 185 kilometers (115 miles) per hour hit the main island of Luzon at the weekend, prompting authorities to shut schools, government offices and the stock market through Monday. President Ferdinand Marcos ordered supplies be airlifted and clean-up equipment be provided to the most-affected communities. “The point at which we can stand down is when the majority of evacuees are already back home,” Marcos said at a news conference with disaster management officials on Monday, referring to the 74,000 people who were forced into evacuation centers by the storm. Luzon, which accounts for more than two-thirds of the economy and roughly half of the country’s 110-million population, started clean-up operations as floods in the capital region had started subsiding, officials said. Five rescue workers were killed in Bulacan province, Governor Daniel Fernando told DZMM radio station, where residents were seen wading through waist-deep waters while some were stranded on rooftops. “Many homes were destroyed but all roads are passable and there were no landslides,” Quezon province Governor Helen Tan told DZRH radio station. The local government had started clearing fallen trees and other debris, she said. President Marcos also ordered officials to provide emergency power supply to two provinces north of the capital, Aurora and Nueva Ecija, which were left without electricity. Karding made landfall as a category 3 typhoon and but weakened as it traversed land on Sunday night. The storm was headed out over the South China Sea and toward Vietnam, according to the state weather agency. The Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,600 islands, sees an average of 20 tropical storms yearly. In 2013, Typhoon Haiyan, one of the most powerful tropical cyclones ever recorded, killed 6,300 people. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines – Parts of Sultan Kudarat will have no electricity on Thursday, August 25, after the National Power Corporation-Small Power Utilities Group’s (Napocor-SPUG) failed to pay its P1.2-billion debt to Petron Corporation for its diesel supply. Napocor-SPUG’s debt has also placed Basilan in a similar situation – the island could lose its power supply before the end of August. SPUG generates the electricity supply in areas that are not linked to the main Mindanao power grid. The towns of Kalamansig and Lebak in Sultan Kudarat are dependent on electricity being generated by Napocor’s diesel-fed power plant and barges in Mindanao. Petron has already stopped supplying diesel to Napocor-SPUG due to its mounting debts. To conserve fuel, Napocor-SPUG started a power curtailment scheme on Tuesday, August 23, which meant 12-hour blackouts in the coastal towns of Kalamansig and Lebak. The towns had no supply of electricity from 8 am to 8 pm, and the same scheme would be in effect on Wednesday, August 24. Napocor notified the Sultan Kudarat Electric Cooperative (Sukelco) about the need to immediately implement the power curtailment scheme, said Sukelco Area 3 manager Francisco Torres. Napocor-SPUG Vice President Larry Sabellina said the move was necessary to stretch whatever is left of the fuel supply for the diesel-fed power plant and barges. The remaining diesel supply is expected to last until Thursday, and all six diesel engines of Napocor-SPUG’s power plant in Kalamansig would be shut down at noon that day. The island province of Basilan, which is dependent on another diesel-fed power plant, is also facing the prospect of losing power by August 29 because of fuel supply problems, Sabellina said. In a memorandum to Napocor-SPUG managers, Sabillena said they tried to persuade Petron on Monday, August 22, into agreeing to continue the diesel supply, but the company’s executives were firm on their position to put on hold deliveries to Napocor-SPUG plants until it pays up. The memo revealed that some areas in Luzon were in the same situation. Sultan Kudarat officials said the power crisis has already affected some 140,000 people in the province and will have repercussions on local businesses and the local economy. Sukelco manager Claudia Pondales and local officials have asked President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to intervene. In a letter addressed to Marcos, Pondales said Sabillena and Petron’s Ramon Ang failed to come into terms, and Petron insisted that it get paid P1.2 billion first before it resumes the diesel supply. She said Ang refused to accept an offer by Napocor-SPUG to pay Petron an initial P250 million. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos is now open to taking back control of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) “if necessary,” amid power shortages in different areas around the country. Malacañang made the statement on Wednesday, May 17, in a statement released prior to a Senate probe into the power supply crisis in Occidental Mindoro and the Panay Island power supply situation. Senator Raffy Tulfo had apparently informed the President of plans to probe the NGCP, a privately-owned company that holds the franchise to operate, manage and maintain the national power grid. Phe grid was operated by government-owned and controlled National Transmission Corporation (TransCo) from 2003 to 2009. Malacañang said that Tulfo, who chairs the Senate energy committee, had told Marcos that he wants to “assess the performance” of the NGCP and review security issues around it, since it is 40% owned by the State Grid Corporation of China. “The President agreed with the senator’s proposal to conduct a comprehensive study or hold hearings to determine the actual situation. If necessary, the government will take back control of the entity,” the Presidential Communications Office said in its statement. It’s not the first time Marcos or Malacañang spoke about the power supply issues plaguing parts of the country. In early May, Marcos had mulled “augmenting” power distribution in Negros and Panay islands. The President, whose wife has Negrense roots, had pointed out the “irony” in having power issues in the area – while distribution is an issue, it has a surplus of power supply. Back then, however, he thumbed down the idea of a government takeover. Senator Sherwin Gatchalian, vice chairman of the energy committee, is also questioning why the NGCP is already supposedly charging customers for projects that are not yet onstream. At least 71 projects of the NGCP are delayed, the senator said in an interview with ANC ahead of the May 17 Senate hearing. Gatchalian, like Tulfo, also agreed that China’s stake in the NGCP is a security concern. He has also flagged the Energy Regularity Commission and the country’s intelligence and security sector for still not coming out with an audit of the NGCP and national power grid’s performance and security. Gatchalian said he had always thought it was a bad idea to privatize the operations of the national power grid. But since that’s already the situation, he said, government should also be “careful” about the message it sends to potential foreign investors. – Rappler.com",

The spokesman was referring to the NPCC resolution recommending the declaration of a food emergency due to the extraordinary increase in rice prices. “Since wala pa sa amin ‘yung kopya, then we cannot do anything about it,” De Mesa said. (As committed by the Secretary, DA will review it as part of due diligence in two days, and then afterwards, possibly make a declaration. Since we still don’t have a copy, then we cannot do anything about it.) Aside from the agriculture chief, members of the NPCC include the chiefs of the Department of Trade and Industry, Department of Health, Department of Environment and Natural Resources, Department of the Interior and Local Government, among others. The DA announced on Monday that a decision will be made on January 22. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had said that the government has been considering the declaration as rice prices remain high despite tariff cuts. Although the DA has been monitoring lower rice prices in the international market, the agency continues to mull declaring a food emergency so it can release the rice buffer stocks of the National Food Authority. “Sa tingin namin, kailangan pa rin kasi kailangan ma-release pa rin ‘yung stocks ng NFA,” De Mesa said. (We think we still need a declaration because we need to release the stocks of the NFA.) The DA previously said NFA warehouses are glutted, storing 300,000 metric tons of rice buffer stocks. The government will have to dispose of the stocks soon as harvest season is about to start. The target release of NFA rice to local governments, public markets is on February 1. — Rappler.com",

Almeda took over as the new NEA administrator on November 21, replacing Juaneza, an appointee of the Duterte administration and whose term was extended in August by President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. EC-MCO United asked Almeda to rescind the NEA order naming Ana Maria Rafael as the NEA-designated Beneco general manager. The group also requested a complete audit of the P58.6 million Sitio Electrification Fund under Rafael’s control The group also urged the new administrator “to hold to account those responsible for the problems and damages BENECO suffered” from the leadership dispute, including those involved in the takeover of the cooperative’s Baguio headquarters. The struggle for Beneco’s general manager seat became a central issue under Juaneza’s watch. The NEA Board of Administrators appointed Rafael, a lawyer and former Malacñang communication official, in July 2021. The following month, most Beneco directors rejected her designation and affirmed the earlier designation of long-time employee and engineer Melchor Licoben to head the cooperative. In a November 23 text message, Licoben expressed optimism that the change in NEA leadership will also usher an end to the issue. “We are very positive that the new administrator will be able to resolve the Beneco issue,” he said. The Beneco leadership row reached its apex and captured public attention when NEA forcibly took control of the Beneco headquarters with backing from fully armed personnel of the Cordillera regional police early dawn of October 18, 2021. A local “people power” led by MCOs and employees took back Beneco two days later. Following the incident, NEA lawyer Omar Mayo, who led the armed takeover, was declared unwelcome in Baguio City and Benguet. The controversy eventually grew into a rift between the Philippine Rural Electric Cooperatives Association and Philreca Representative Presley de Jesus over the power of NEA to appoint a general manager for electric cooperatives in the country. The incident also triggered inquiries in the House of Representatives and the Senate. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Employees who have rendered at least one year of service to the Department of Education (DepEd) are entitled to a P3,000 anniversary bonus, the department said in an order dated Monday, June 19. The bonus comes as part of the DepEd’s 125th anniversary celebration and “milestone year.” The DepEd was founded on June 23, 1898. “All DepEd officials and employees who are employed on a full-time or part-time basis, permanent, coterminous, provisional, temporary, casual or contractual whose employment is in the nature of a regular employee, are eligible for the grant of anniversary bonus,” reads DepEd Department Order No. 11. Meanwhile, the following are ineligible for the grant: The basis of the bonus comes from a 1996 administrative order that authorizes the grant of an anniversary bonus to officials and employees in government agencies in celebration of their agency’s “milestone years,” which start from the 15th anniversary, and every fifth year thereafter. By law, the DepEd is entitled to the lion’s share of the Philippine budget. In the DepEd’s P678.3-billion 2023 budget, there is an allotted P150-million confidential fund. Vice President Sara Duterte, who is also the incumbent education secretary, earlier defended the need for a P150-million confidential fund to fight the “sexual grooming of learners, recruitment in terrorism and violent extremism, [and] drug use of DepEd personnel.” On top of the DepEd’s confidential funds, Duterte was also allotted another P500 million in confidential and intelligence funds in the Office of the Vice President. As of 2021, the total number of public school teachers in all levels of basic education is 876,842, according to DepEd data. In 2022, the DepEd announced plans to hire 10,000 more teachers in 2023. It also set a goal to offload administrative tasks from teachers, so that they could focus more on teaching. Filipino teachers are among the hundreds of thousands of Filipinos going abroad to work. Some, particularly those in the private sector, choose to do domestic work abroad due to better pay. In response to this phenomenon, the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration in 2018 set up a program that allows overseas Filipino workers who passed the Licensure Exam for Teachers to join the Philippines’ public school system when they return to the country. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine embassy in Amman has received requests from nine families to be repatriated back to the Philippines from Gaza, the Department of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday, October 10. The nine families consist of 39 Filipinos and 11 Palestinians married to Filipinos. Of the Filipinos, 17 are minors aged 2 to 15, said the DFA. “We are working on [their request],” said DFA Undersecretary Eduardo de Vega in a separate briefing in Malacañang. The embassy in Amman, which has jurisdiction over Gaza, recommends placing the exclave under Alert Level 3, which means repatriation is still optional. It will require approval from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. before it is formally put in place. Violence has raged across Gaza and Israel’s southern areas after Hamas, in a weekend move that surprised even Israel’s vaunted military and intelligence network, launched the biggest assault on Israel in decades. The DFA has not released details of its repatriation plans for Filipinos in Gaza. There are over 137 Filipino nationals living in the Gaza Strip, said De Vega. None are overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), and most are Filipino nationals married to Palestinians. Gaza or the Gaza Strip is Palestinian territory that’s controlled by Hamas, an Islamist group. After the group – designated a terrorist organization by countries like the United States, Japan, and the European Union – took control of Gaza, the strip has since been under blockade through air, land, and sea. It’s that previous status of a blockade on top of the ongoing violence that makes it extra difficult to bring Filipino nationals back home. Typically, it’s only through the Gaza-Israel border that people can exit Gaza. No Filipino in Israel has asked for repatriation thus far, although De Vega noted that the Philippines is ready should the need to bring nationals back home arise. Most OFWs in Israel, said De Vega, are not living in the southern part of the country, where skirmishes and attacks are happening. The Philippine embassy in Tel Aviv has discouraged travel from the Philippines to Israel. – Rappler.com",

US treaty ally the Philippines has repeatedly sparred at sea with China, the main U.S. rival in the Indo-Pacific, this past year, but the two sides have now reached a “provisional arrangement” to ease tensions and manage differences. Marcos greeted Secretary of State Blinken and Defense Secretary Austin at the Malacañang Palace on Tuesday morning ahead of meetings with their Filipino counterparts, the first such meetings hosted by the Philippines. “I’m always very happy that these communication lines are very open so that all the things that we are doing together, in terms of our alliance, in terms of the specific context of our situation here, in the West Philippine Sea and in the Indo-Pacific, are continuously examined and re-examined so we are agile in terms of our responses,” Marcos said. The Philippines has competing claims with China in the waters to its west also known as the South China Sea. China claims 90% of the sea as its sovereign territory. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said Blinken and Austin discussed with Marcos “their shared commitment to upholding international law in the South China Sea.” “The two secretaries underscored the United States’ ironclad commitments to the Philippines under our Mutual Defense Treaty,” Miller said in a statement following the meeting. At the start of the meeting, Marcos said he was “a bit surprised” to see the two secretaries given how “interesting” the US political situation has become, a reference to President Joe Biden this month ending his re-election campaign and endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris to take on former President Donald Trump in a November election. Blinken offered Marcos greetings from Harris, as well as from Biden. Blinken, the top US diplomat, said a “steady drumbeat of very high-level engagements in our countries that are covering the full range of issues and opportunities that bring us together not only security, but also economic.” – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed that his administration is considering holding a plebiscite to ratify proposed changes to the Constitution simultaneous with the 2025 midterm elections. He said the proposed dual vote on May 12 next year would be cost-efficient. “Oo, pinagaaralan talaga namin yun dahil kung paghihiwalayin natin ‘yang election at saka ‘yung plebiscite, parang dalawang eleksyon ‘yun e, napakamahal,” he told reporters before he left the Philippines for Australia on Wednesday, February 28. (We are studying that possibility because if we will hold the election and the plebiscite separately, that would be like two polls, which would be expensive.) “If we are able to incorporate the two exercises together, as a practical matter palagay ko makakatulong ‘yan (that will be a big help),” he added. Zubiri first disclosed on Monday, February 26, that Marcos had told him he would prefer a plebiscite on economic charter change alongside the midterm polls. There are resolutions in both House and the Senate seeking to amend or revise the economic provisions of the present charter through a constituent assembly. Both documents differ on how both chambers would vote on the proposed amendments – either jointly or separately. That caveat has been a longtime major point of contention between both chambers. The 24-member Senate doesn’t want to vote jointly with the 300-plus-member House because senators will essentially be powerless. The Commission on Elections (Comelec) said on Tuesday, February 27, that it sees no problem with conducting two electoral exercises on the same day in May 2025. “Okay na okay po ang Comelec kung sakaling pagsasabayin, lalo na kung ang purpose nito ay ang makatipid. Kapag po kasi hiniwalay natin ang isang plebisito, aabutin po ng P13 bilyon ang magagastos,” Comelec Chairman George Garcia said. “Medyo hahaba lang po nang kaunti ang ating balota.” (The Comelec is okay with a simultaneous conduct of the midterm polls and the plebiscite, especially if the purpose is to save money. If we hold a separate plebiscite, the expenses would reach P13 billion. Our ballots will just be a bit longer.) In January, Garcia had expressed reservations about the idea of holding a plebiscite alongside the midterm polls, saying: “If the ballot is about changing the Constitution, that should be the only agenda so that the public can absorb better the implications of their vote.” He also used a 1981 Supreme Court ruling to bolster his argument, but he has changed tune since, citing a study conducted by the poll body’s law department. “‘Yung cina-cite na desisyon ng Occena vs Comelec ay hindi naman daw specific na nailagay na bawal talaga na pagsabayin, basta dapat magkaroon ng massive information dissemination para lang alam ng mga mamamayan kung ano ‘yung binoboto nila,” Garcia said on Tuesday. (Our Law Department says Occena vs Comelec was not specific in saying that a nationwide election and a plebiscite can’t be done simultaneously. It’s okay as long as there is massive information dissemination so that the public knows what their vote will be about.) – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. reminded Filipinos to follow in the footsteps of Filipino revolutionary leader Andres Bonifacio, a model of heroism and patriotism, on the occasion of his 160th birth anniversary on Thursday, November 30. Marcos skipped the Bonifacio Day rites in Caloocan City on Thursday, delegating Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin to deliver his prepared speech. “Sa diwa ng bayaning si Gat Andres Bonifacio, tayo ay tinatawag hindi lamang na ialay ang ating buhay para sa Inang Bayan, kundi pati na ang pagbuhos ng ating kahusayan, galing, tapang, at oras upang ang bawat hakbang natin ay maging ilaw ng pag-asa at inspirasyon para sa ating mga kababayan,” Marcos said through Bersamin. (In the spirit of hero Andres Bonifacio, we are called not just to dedicate our life to our country, but to devout our excellence, skills, courage, and time so that our every step would turn into a ray of hope and inspiration for our countrymen.) “Nakikita na natin ang kabayanihang ito sa ating mga makabagong bayani. Sa sipag at tiyaga ng mga manggagawang Pilipino, sa walang kapantay na galing ng ating mga nars at doktor, sa wagas na dedikasyon ng mga guro, sa matibay na kagitingan ng ating kapulisan at kasundaluhan, sa hindi matatawarang skripisyo ng ating mga OFW,” he added. (We see this kind of courage in our modern-day heroes, through the hard work of our Filipino laborers, the greatness of our nurses and doctors, the dedication of our teachers, the acts of valor of our policemen and soldiers, and the sacrifices of our overseas Filipino workers.) Bonifacio, regarded as the Father of the Philippine Revolution, led the secret movement Katipunan to fight Spanish colonization in the late 1800s. Bonifacio Day is a regular holiday in the Philippines, but November 30 this year became a working day. The observance of the holiday was adjusted to the November 27, the nearest Monday, as part of the government’s “holiday economics” strategy. In his speech, Bersamin said Marcos was unable to join them at the Bonifacio Day rites because he was preparing to leave for Dubai “to attend that all-important international conference” which is the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP28). Malacañang later announced that Marcos canceled that trip at the last minute, citing “important developments in the hostage situation involving 17 Filipino seafarers in the Red Sea.” – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA. Philippines – Adelinda Perez, a former cashier at the Department of Education (DepEd) in Sorsogon, found a momentary reprieve from a two-decade financial burden. The Commission on Audit (COA), in a rare decision, suspended efforts to collect over P3 million in stolen payroll funds after acknowledging Perez’s frail health and difficult circumstances. The decision, although temporary, gave the aging Perez a brief respite from the weight of bureaucracy and her staggering financial obligation. Perez’s burden traces back to 2002 when P3.7 million, meant for mid-year bonuses and cash gifts for DepEd employees, went missing. Police investigators concluded that it was an inside job, but Perez and two others were cleared of any criminal liability. The COA, however, held them responsible administratively and they were still required to pay – a debt Perez, now elderly and battling illness, has been unable to fully repay. The others held administratively liable, former DepEd Sorsogon division superintendent Dominador Osea and disbursing officer Nydia Bercasio, have since passed away. For years, Perez struggled to make a dent in the amount, managing to pay only P277,937. The heirs of Bercasio, the late former DepEd-Sorsogon disbursing officer, contributed P309,441. But together, their payments scarcely eased the debt. Living on a meager pension from the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS), Perez pleaded with the COA on April 22, 2022, to write off the remaining amount, citing her advanced age and mounting medical expenses. Initially, her request was denied by the COA on the ground that the court rulings on the criminal aspect of the case were not binding upon the Commission. The COA had also pointed out that her age, health problems, and financial struggles didn’t qualify as “exceptional circumstances” for debt relief based on the rules. Subsequently, the COA granted her temporary relief in a pro hac vice decision, a Latin phrase meaning “for this particular instance.” While not a write-off, the commission’s decision, signed by COA Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba and Commissioners Roland Café Pondoc and Mario Lipana, provided that Perez would not be required to make further payments “for the meantime,” and until she is able to pay. “Notwithstanding the above discussion and for humanitarian consideration, since Ms. Perez is the only surviving person liable to refund the remaining balance, who is already of advanced age, with medical condition, and currently experiencing financial constraints, she will not, for the meantime, be required to pay the said amount,” read part of the COA ruling. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines on Sunday, October 8, condemned attacks by Hamas on Israel that killed at least 250 Israelis and had Hamas escaping with dozens of hostages in by far the deadliest day of violence in Israel since the Yom Kippur war 50 years ago. “The Philippines conveys its deepest sympathies and condolences to those who have lost family members and loved ones in recent attacks,” Malacañang said. “The Philippines condemns the attacks, especially against civilian populations,” it added. The attack on Saturday, October 7, came 50 years and a day after Egyptian and Syrian forces launched an assault during the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur in an effort to retrieve territory Israel had taken during a brief conflict in 1967. Malacañang noted that the Philippines understands the right of states to self-defense in the light of external aggression as recognized in the United Nations Charter. In a separate statement on Sunday, Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said that the Philippines is monitoring the situation in Israel and “will continue to look after the welfare of Filipinos who are affected by the current situation.” The Department of Foreign Affairs is monitoring the situation of Filipinos in the Middle East. The Philippines will continue to look after the welfare of Filipinos who are affected by the current situation @DFAPHL At a press briefing on Sunday morning, Israeli Ambassador to Manila Ilan Fluss called on Filipinos and other countries to condemn the attack and to stand in solidarity with them. “We call on our friends and allies to express strong support for Israel and to condemn these terror attacks by Hamas. We expect the international community and our close allies to condemn terror and express support for Israel’s right to defend itself and its citizens,” he said. “As we navigate these challenging times, a resounding message reverberates: Stand with Israel, condemn the attacks by Hamas, and reject terrorism unequivocally,” Fluss added. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has also instructed the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) and the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) to “locate and account for all overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) and their families in Israel.” The DMW has opened a hotline and other communication channels that will accept calls and queries from our OFWs and the Filipino community who are in need of government assistance. Israel and the Philippines have had good bilateral relations. The Israel Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines lists 14 major bilateral agreements between the two countries. Israel also benefits from Philippine overseas workers, primarily within the area of caregiving. The number of Filipino care workers working in Israel in the 1980s reached a high of 100,000, or about 7% of the Israeli work force. In an interview with the Manila Bulletin in 2018, Philippine Ambassador to Israel Nathaniel Imperial said 24,000 out of 29,000 Filipino workers currently in the country are caregivers. Fluss couldn’t give definite figures yet regarding how many were affected by the attack. Meanwhile, he advised tourists to exercise caution in visiting Israel. No travel restrictions have been imposed yet. – Rappler.com",

The Presidential Communications Office (PCO) announced on Wednesday, December 6, that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. appointed Ablan as assistant secretary of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Malacañang also promoted DTI Assistant Secretary Mary Jean Pacheco to undersecretary. Ablan joined Department of Education in 2022, under the leadership of Vice President Sara Duterte. Since December 2022, Rappler tried to get in touch with him to ask about about the agency’s supposed inability to pay on-time a logistics firm in-charge of fast-tracking the delivery of laptops. This resulted in a string of new problems, including the blatant sale of the laptops by other subcontractors. Ablan was not yet part of DepEd when the contract with the company named Transpac was signed, but its implementation spilled over into the Duterte-led DepEd. Transpac’s demand letter in November 2022 was addressed to him, given that his unit was in charge of the matter. He resigned from the DepEd in May but told Philstar.com that this had “nothing to do with the laptop or Transpac reports of Rappler,” and promised to “answer point by point the issues raised by those reports in order to clear my name.” During the Rodrigo Duterte administration, Ablan held numerous posts at the Presidential Communications Operations Office, such as undersecretary, assistant secretary, and acting deputy presidential spokesperson. – Rappler.com",

It is only the Anti-Money Laundering Council that has the authority to freeze assets. PAMPANGA, Philippines – The Malacañang has issued a memorandum to the Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to freeze and preserve all assets of the seven companies that are under investigation by the House of Representatives’ quad committee. Based on the memorandum signed by Executive Secretary and Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) chair Lucas Bersamin on October 22, released to the media on Monday, October 28, the seven firms are as follows: “Pursuant to the ongoing inquiry, in aid of legislation being conducted by the House of Representatives joint committees on illegal activities linked to illegal POGOs, the AMLC is hereby directed, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations, to apply with the appropriate court for the issuance of a freeze order or provisional asset reservation order covering all assets of the corporations, which are in any way related to an unlawful activity, as defined by Republic Act No. 9160,” the order stated. Under the anti-money laundering law, AMLC has the authority to freeze assets that, upon its own determination of probable cause, may likely be related to an unlawful activity. AMLC’s freeze order is only valid for 15 days, and within that period the owners have 72 hours to respond to the order. Any extension beyond the 15 days shall be by order of a court. In a separate letter addressed to Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and Bureau of Immigration (BI) Commissioner Joel Anthony Viado, the PAOCC also ordered the deportation of 192 foreign nationals, most of whom are Chinese, apprehended during a raid operation involving 3D Analyzer Information Technologies Incorporated. PAOCC directed the DOJ and BI to facilitate the transportation of the apprehended foreign nationals who were transferred to PAOCC’s temporary detention facility and to ensure their summary deportation while blacklisting them to prevent their re-entry into the Philippines. The quad committee, now on its ninth session, has been investigating since August controversies faced by the Duterte administration — illegal POGOs, his drug war, and the extrajudicial killings. – Rappler.com *Editor’s Note: An earlier version of this story mistook a Pampanga-based company for Yatai International Holdings Group, which is based in Thailand and is the one included in Malacañang’s memo.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – State auditors called out the provincial government of Albay for buying 150 tablets for distance learning, after they discovered that the devices were obsolete. In a report, the Commission on Audit (COA) said the tablets fell short of the Department of Education’s (DepEd) performance standards, rendering them useless for students. The COA report noted that the Albay provincial government claimed that budgetary constraints prevented it from buying tablets with the DepEd-required specifications. The COA said, “The quality of the purchased tablets should not be sacrificed to increase the quantity of purchased tablets, or for any other reason. Such practice will be counterproductive to the purpose of ensuring effective implementation of blended/distance learning.” The tablets, according to auditors, “do not satisfy the Memory and Operating System (OS) required as the minimum technical specifications for DepEd.” The purchase of the tablets, funded by the provincial government through its Special Education Fund (SEF), aimed to enhance blended and distance learning in public schools. The tablets were bought by the provincial government for P15,000 each or a total of P2.25 million. Auditors, however, found the devices lacking in important specifications: they came with just one gigabyte (GB) of random access memory (RAM), 16GB of storage, no micro-Universal Serial Bus (USB) ports, and ran on the outdated Android 4.4 KitKat operating system (OS). In contrast, DepEd’s recommended specifications require at least 2GB of memory, 32GB of storage, a micro-USB port, and an Android 9.0 operating system. The COA said the tablets’ old OS and insufficient memory would result in slow performance and inability of the devices to get upgrades, undermining their effectiveness in an educational setting. State auditors pointed out that the Android 4.4 Kikat “won’t be getting any more updates to Google Play Services beyond version 23.30.99 hence marking the OS as finally obsolete.” They added, “Outdated operating systems can slow down a system’s performance causing slow boot times, slow application launch times, and sluggish overall performance.” Android 4.4 KitKat revolutionized the mobile OS landscape with significant improvements in performance, usability, and aesthetics when it was launched on October 31, 2013. It optimized memory usage and brought features like the “OK Google” voice command. A decade later, KitKat has become obsolete, struggling to keep up with the demands of modern technology. The COA said, “Having too little Random Access Memory (RAM) on the tablets might have several disadvantages and impact overall system performance. Tablets with limited RAM may operate slower, especially if there isn’t enough RAM to support all the running applications.” Instead of buying 150 outdated tablets, auditors said, the provincial government should have opted for fewer units that met the minimum specifications to ensure better performance. –Rappler.com",

A press release from the Presidential Communications Office on Thursday, December 21, said he will also be a member of the MIAA’s Board of Directors. Malacañang describes him as an airport operations expert who has been in the industry for decades. His portfolio includes the following: Ines went to the University of the Philippines for his tertiary education. Malacañang said he completed a course on airport and airline management and aviation security at the Bailbrook College School of Aviation in the United Kingdom. There is little information about him available online, which indicates he has mostly kept a low public profile. A few news reports in the past have quoted him on issues involving airlines he was associated with, such as when a woman was suspected to have killed her newly born child while aboard an Etihad Airlines plane in 2008, or when a passenger plane operated by Gulf Air crashed in Bahraini territory in 2000, killing 143 people, including a Filipino. Ines was also senior executive assistant to the secretary of the defunct-Department of Local Government and Community Development from 1973 to 1986, under the administration of then-President Ferdinand Marcos Sr. Ines is replacing Cesar Chiong, who was dismissed from service by the Ombudsman in August for grave misconduct, abuse of authority, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service. Ines is inheriting an agency that was in crisis, as some MIAA employees opposed Chiong’s dismissal, and as the bidding for the rehabilitation of one of the world’s “most stressful” airports continues. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Agriculture (DA) may declare a food security emergency on Wednesday, January 22, after the agency reviews the resolution from the National Price Coordinating Council which they have yet to receive. “[A]ng sabi ni Secretary ‘pag na-receive ngayon, tuloy ang review ngayong araw hanggang bukas. So by Wednesday there will be an action from the Secretary being siya ‘yung talagang may responsibility towards declaration ng food security emergency,” DA spokesman Arnel de Mesa told reporters on Monday, January 20. (The Secretary said that if we receive the resolution today, the review will continue from today until tomorrow. By Wednesday, the Secretary will take action, as he holds the responsibility for declaring a food security emergency) Under the amended Rice Tariffication Law, the agriculture secretary can declare a food security emergency due to supply shortage or extraordinary increase in prices. However, Tiu Laurel previously said that he will still consult with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. nonetheless. Marcos said on January 17 that high prices of rice — despite tariff cuts — made the government contemplate declaring a food emergency. The president said they have “done everything they could” to bring down prices but the market is “not being allowed to work properly.” If the declaration of a food security emergency pushes through on Wednesday, the National Food Authority may then sell their stocks to local governments and free up overwhelmed warehouses in time for the harvest season. (READ: High rice prices, glutted warehouses may push gov’t to declare food emergency) According to De Mesa, warehouses remain congested despite the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) regular purchase of NFA rice. “Regular naman din ‘yung pagbili nga ng DSWD pero hindi siya nakakabili ng ganoong kadami kasi wala naman siyang bodega,” said De Mesa. “300,000 metric tons is almost six million bags na hindi naman kayang ubusin din agad ng DSWD o ibang ahensya na namamahala sa relief efforts.” (The DSWD regularly buys but they can’t buy that much because they don’t have warehouses. 300,000 metric tons is almost six million bags and the DSWD or other agencies manning relief efforts can’t easily dispose of that.) The DA targets to make NFA rice available to consumers in public markets by February 1, said De Mesa. The NFA will sell at P36 per kilo of rice to local governments, which are then supposed to sell to the public with a maximum profit of P2 per kilo. Meanwhile, the implementation of the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) for imported rice in Metro Manila has started. De Mesa noted that many public markets they monitored are compliant with the P58-MSRP, save for the Guadalupe Commercial Complex, Pasay Public Market where they saw premium imported rice sold at P59 per kilo. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – Authorities arrested more than a dozen suspected traders and poachers of agarwood, including foreigners, and seized P145 million worth of the so-called “wood of the gods” in Davao del Norte, officials said on Monday, October 10. Police arrested 17 suspects in the village of Magugpo East in Tagum City, the capital of Davao del Norte, on Friday, October 7. Confiscated from the suspects were 145 kilograms of the expensive agarwood, each kilo valued at P1 million, during the operation staged by a joint team of various police offices, the Coast Guard, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in the Davao Region. Agarwood comes from the non-timber species locally known as the lapnisan or aquilaria tree which can be found in Southeast Asia. The tree itself is practically worthless until it catches a mold infection, and its parts produce pathogens as its defense mechanism. The process turns the wood into agarwood which is used in making incense, perfume, and small, expensive carvings. In some countries, agarwood is used for traditional medicine. The problem is that the tree species that produce agarwood can be found in the wild in the Davao Region where cutting trees is prohibited. Brigadier General Benjamin Silo, the police director for the Davao Region, said the arrests signal a police crackdown on illegal agarwood traders and poachers in the region. He said authorities were preparing charges against the suspects for violation of the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act, and the Forestry Reform Code of the Philippines. Police said three of those arrested were Malaysians Hamdam Zakaria, Alyasah Zakaria, and Shahidan Saari, and their interpreter Dennis Asuncion. The other suspects were from different places in Leyte and the Davao Region. Police identified the following 13 suspects: The exact place where the confiscated pieces of agarwood were sourced was still unclear as of this posting. The arrested Malaysians and Asuncion were taken into custody by the police’s Regional Special Operations Group, while the rest of the suspects were taken to the Tagum City Police Station. Police said the Malaysians, who had P4.3 million in cash with them, were the buyers of agarwood. – Rappler.com",

According to De Mesa, the agency plans to lower the MSRP further following periodic reviews. The implementation of a lower MSRP comes two days after the DA announced a food security emergency on rice to enable the NFA to release its rice buffer stocks. As of February 1, prices of imported rice ranged from P38 (regular-milled) to P61 (special).

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Vice President Sara Duterte broke her silence for the first time regarding continued Chinese harassment of Filipino vessels in the West Philippine Sea (WPS). But instead of giving her thoughts about the growing tension, she said: “No comment.” The Vice President made a brief statement on Monday, April 8, in an ambush interview when she was asked to react to the sea dispute. “I think the statement of Cong. Paolo Duterte about me and the West Philippine Sea is comprehensive,” she added. On March 27, her brother, Davao City 1st District Representative Paolo Duterte, said that it was not the job of the Vice President and the secretary of education to “demonize China or any country for that matter.” The lawmaker was reacting to an Akbayan party-list statement as to why the Vice President was mum on the issue. “The question on the actions of Chinese vessels in the WPS should be directed to the chief architect of foreign policy, the Secretary of National Defense and the Secretary of Foreign Affairs,” he added. The Vice President has been silent on the issue concerning national security, and yet she has openly defended doomsday preacher Apollo Quiboloy, who has been tagged as a fugitive by the National Bureau of Investigation. She has downplayed the sexual abuse and human trafficking charges filed against Quiboloy, describing the congressional probe as “unfair.” The Duterte family is known to favor China. Former president Rodrigo Duterte made a pro-China pivot during his administration. (READ: Duterte’s ‘China pivot’ draws int’l reactions) On the contrary, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has made a commitment to defend the country against China’s actions. He ordered to strengthen the Philippines’ maritime security through Executive Order 57, which renamed and reorganized the National Coast Watch Council into the National Maritime Council. (READ: What is EO 57, which bolsters PH maritime security amid China’s bullying?) In a Pulse Asia survey released in January, eight in 10 Filipinos wanted the country to work with the United States to resolve the sea dispute.

    "article_body": "MELBOURNE, Australia – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Wednesday, March 6, said it is not the time to invoke the country’s Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States, even after four Navy personnel sustained minor injuries from actions of the China Coast Guard in the West Philippine Sea. “I do not think that it is a time or the reason to invoke the Mutual Defense Treaty. However, we continue to view with great alarm this continuing dangerous maneuvers and dangerous actions that are being done against our seamen, our Coast Guard,” Marcos said in a recorded interview, responding to questions sent by Philippine media in Australia. The MDT, signed in 1951, means that both countries are compelled to come to each other’s defense in the event of an armed attack. The US, in a statement from State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller, affirmed on March 5 that the MDT covers “armed attacks on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or aircraft – including those of its Coast Guard – anywhere in the South China Sea.” Marcos is in Melbourne to attend a special summit hosted by Australia. He is flying back to Manila late Wednesday. On March 5, two China Coast Guard ships used their water cannons on the smaller Unaizah May 4, a civilian ship tapped by the Philippine Navy to bring supplies to the BRP Sierra Madre, a World War II ship ran aground on purpose in Ayungin Shoal. The pressure from the water cannons shattered the wind shield of the resupply ship, leaving four Navy personnel with minor injuries, including small cuts. The same China Coast Guard ships collided with a Philippine Coast Guard ship and the same Unaizah May 4, as they tried to block the Philippine ships from reaching Ayungin Shoal. The other resupply ship, the Unaizah May 1, made it past China’s blocking attempts and reached the BRP Sierra Madre. “This time, they damaged the cargo ship and caused some injury to some of our seamen and I think that we cannot view this in any way but in the most serious way,” said Marcos. “Once again, we will make our objections known and hope that we can continue to communicate to find a way so that such actions are no longer seen in the West Philippine Sea,” he said, without elaborating. In a separate statement on March 6, Philippine Defense Secretary Gibo Teodoro said the China Coast Guard and Chinese Maritime Militia’s actions in the West Philippine Sea “are patently illegal and downright uncivilized.” “They take great pains to mischaracterize their provocations as lawful under international law and the actions of their CCG and Maritime Militia as ‘professional, restrained, reasonable, and lawful.’ This claim is, simply put, one that no right-thinking State in the world agrees with and which many outright condemn,” added Teodoor, whose portfolio includes the Philippine military. The Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) earlier summoned China’s Deputy Chief of Mission, telling Beijing to make its vessels “leave the vicinity of Ayungin Shoal immediately.” The Philippine embassy in Beijing has also lodged a protest before China’s Foreign Affairs Ministry. Ayungin Shoal is a feature in the West Philippine Sea, or part of the South China Sea within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. China claims practically all of the South China Sea, despite a 2016 Arbitral Ruling deeming their claim invalid. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and his family were in Hawaii more than three decades ago as exiles. This time, he is returning to the island state as the Philippine president. But Marcos Jr., the son of late tyrant Ferdinand E. Marcos said his return to Hawaii will not be a full circle moment. Instead, he just wants to be reunited with his old friends, he said. “Now, of course, Honolulu and Hawaii in general have different dimension also because nga that was the time that we were in exile. But that dimension is not some kind of, I don’t know, full circle. No, it’s not like that,” Marcos Jr. told reporters in San Francisco, California on Saturday, November 18. “It’s just I really want to go and see my old friends. These were the people who looked after us after ‘86. These were the people who fed us. They brought us clothes. They brought food. Kung hindi sa kanila (if it were not for them), I don’t know what would have happened to us,” the President added. Marcos Jr. recalled that they made many friends during their exile, and the Hawaiian people were very hospitable to them. He said it would be “silly” not to go to Hawaii, after his visit in the United States’ west coast. “So, yes, of course, it’s different in that sense. But it’s just a kind of a revisiting and just visiting with really old friends that – who shared our difficult times together and helped lighten the load, I have to say, helped lighten the load for us in the time of exile,” the president said. For the third time, Marcos Jr. is visiting the US — the Philippines’ long-time ally — to participate at the 2023 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in California from November 15 to 17. After the summit, Marcos Jr. was expected to visit the Filipino community in Hawaii. The chief executive will also pay a visit to the US Indo-Pacific Command, which covers the Indo-Pacific region, including the waters near the Philippines. Marcos Jr.’s return to Hawaii is symbolic because he, returning as the president, shows how their family was able to regain power after their downfall. Instead of paying for their crimes in the Philippines, the late tyrant Marcos flew to Hawaii on February 26, 1986 after he was ousted by the EDSA People Power Revolution. Marcos the dictator flew in the island state with his wife, children, including the incumbent president, and other companions like then-military chief Fabian Ver. Amnesty International (AI) estimated that 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed during the late dictator’s tyrannical regime. In a 1989 interview, Marcos Jr. claimed they were under the impression that they will be transported to their hometown, Ilocos Norte, and not in Hawaii, when they flew after his father’s downfall. However, a fact-check article by Rappler said that the Marcos family was not kidnapped when they were brought to Hawaii. While in exile, the Marcoses maintained the support of their loyalists in Hawaii, with dozens of Filipino-Americans taking the streets to show support for them back in the day. But at present, not all Filipinos in Hawaii are supportive of the president and his family. Some Filipinos in the island state like Arcy Imasa, co-chairperson of the Hawaii Filipinos for Truth, Justice and Democracy, continue to push back against the Marcoses and amplify the truths about their bloody regime. — With reports from Dwight de Leon/ Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "BACOLOD , Philippines – Power consumers in three cities in Negros Occidental will experience a 12-hour power outage this weekend, but it will have nothing to do with the power crisis now gripping the Visayas following the shutdown of several power generation plants. The National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP) and Central Negros Electric Cooperative (Ceneco) announced the power supply interruption scheduled from 6 am to 6 pm this Sunday, April 21. It will affect the cities of Bacolod, Silay, and Talisay. In their advisories, the NGCP and Ceneco said the scheduled supply interruption would allow them to conduct line maintenance, improve electric poles, and substations. Talisay Mayor Nilo Antonio Neil Lizarez expressed dismay, saying a 12-hour blackout at a time when temperatures are rising due to the El Nino phenomenon-induced drought would inconvenience people and take a toll on local businesses. “Still, we can do nothing,” Lizares said, expressing exasperation. The announcement came on the third day of a power crisis that gripped Visayas and resulted in rotational blackouts blamed by the NGCP on the shutdown of 13 power plants and the derated capacities of nine others. The NGCP has raised the alert level due to the thinning power supply – or the loss of 696.7 megawatts – in the Visayas grid. Luzon is also facing a similar crisis. As of Thursday, April 18, the NGCP said Visayas’ power capacity stood at 2,662 MW against a peak demand of 2,465 MW, leaving it only with a 197-MW reserve. The Metro Bacolod Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MBCCI) called for an explanation about how it was possible for nearly three dozen power plants in the Visayas and Luzon, according to NGCP, to suspend operations early this week. “We are in a power crisis right now. But it’s crazy and funny to declare that 19 power plants in Luzon and 13 others in the Visayas simultaneously shut down… This is really next to impossible,” said Frank Carbon, MBCCI’s chief executive officer. He added, “Where are these power plants? Can NGCP name them one by one? Power consumers in the Visayas need to know the truth. And where’s the DOE (Department of Energy) now?” Carbon said he was worried that the situation in Visayas would worsen if the national government prioritized the Luzon power grid. The MBCCI called on Negros Occidental Governor Eugenio Jose Lacson and Bacolod Mayor Alfredo Abelardo Benitez to call for an emergency meeting among stakeholders to immediately map out contigency measures. Carbon and his group also called for the creation of a power supply coordinating council under the Provincial Development Council to focus on addressing the problem about the local power supply. Without a sufficient power supply, according to Carbon, NGCP’s Mindanao-Visayas Interconnectivity Project and the newly inaugurated P67-billion, 230-kilovolt Cebu-Negros-Panay (CNP) backbone project will be rendered “inutile.” “What’s the use of such transmission facilities if there is no power to transmit?” Carbon pointed out. –Rappler.com",

Republic Act (RA) No. 11982, signed into law by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday, February 26, compels the government to hand out P10,000 in cash to Filipinos who have reached the age of 80, and every five years thereafter, until they reach 95. Once they cross the 100-year mark, the cash gift balloons to P100,000, a provision from the 2016 law that remains untouched. “But they deserve more than cash in an envelope. What they should get is a support infrastructure that every society owes to its graying population,” Marcos said in a speech after he signed the measure. The new law also creates an Elderly Data Management System, according to a press release from House Speaker Martin Romualdez’s office. A copy of RA 11982 has yet to be uploaded on the website of the Official Gazette. The measure’s main sponsors in Congress were Senior Citizens Representative Rodolfo Ordanes and Senator Imee Marcos.

In a release, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman said Marcos and his Cabinet had approved the NEP, which was set at P5.768 trillion. The amount is 21.8% of the Philippines’ gross domestic product. Marcos convened a full Cabinet meeting on Thursday, June 22. Pangandaman said the budget would “prioritize expenditures that will sustain economic growth, bearing in mind inclusivity and sustainability,” without giving more specifics. The budget is in line with the Marcos administration’s Philippine Development Plan (PDP) 2023-2028 and the administration’s 8-point socioeconomic agenda, said the budget chief. Pangandaman said they would submit the proposed budget to the Congress weeks after Marcos’ second State of the Nation Address (SONA) on July 24. The executive must submit its proposed budget within 30 days after the SONA, the President’s yearly address before the Congress. During the SONA, the chief executive traditionally highlights his administration’s milestones and lays out his priorities, including the legislation he wants Congress to pass. In the Philippines, the Congress is almost always dominated by a majority that’s allied with the chief executive. The Congress is supposed to scrutinize the proposed budget. Once it passes both chambers and is signed by the President, it becomes the General Appropriations Act for the fiscal year. – Rappler.com",

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Over 80 Japanese employers are seeking to hire more Filipino workers, citing their “excellent work ethic and friendly disposition,” the Philippine Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) said on Thursday, February 9. Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople met with Japanese employers and Filipino workers in Japan during her work as part of the delegation of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s “official working visit” to Japan, which began on Wednesday, February 8. “The general sentiment among Japanese employers was that Filipino workers brightened up their workplaces, and were highly reliable and trainable,” Ople said. Ople said that a “Japan desk” would be created in the Office of the Secretary to fast-track the needs of both Japanese employers and OFWs with Japan as their host country. The employers attended a consultation meeting organized by the Migrant Workers Office (formerly known as the Philippine Overseas Labor Office) in Osaka, led by labor attaché Elizabeth Estrada. After the employers’ meeting, the office also held a dialogue with overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) based in Japan under the Technical Internship Training Program (TITP) and the Special Skilled Worker (SSW) programs. Ople attended both meetings. According to the DMW, the TITP aims to accept workers from various countries “to acquire industrial and vocational skills in Japan to contribute to the improvement of their occupational lives when they return to their home countries.” Meanwhile, the SSW allows the Japanese government to recruit foreign workers to fill employment quotas in 14 industrial fields. The DMW said that Filipino workers assured Ople that “they are being treated well.” They also reportedly said they would opt to continue working in Japan if given the chance by their employers and the Japanese government. “Mababait po ang aming employers. Minsan, sila pa nagdadala ng pagkain para sa amin,” the DMW quoted an employee of SuperCourt as saying. (Our employers are kindhearted. Sometimes, they even bring us food.) DMW data shows that workers’ salaries in Japan range from 130,000 yen (P54,548) for entry-level TITP trainees, and up to 900,000 yen (P377,640) for specialized positions occupied by skilled workers. The migrant workers secretary said that a major challenge OFWs face is passing the Japanese language proficiency test. Under the Japan-Philippines Economic Partnership Agreement, Filipinos can take the Preparatory Japanese Language Training, which is a six-month training on Japanese language basics. “We will look into these bottlenecks and obstacles and try to untangle them one by one. Japan has proven to be a reliable partner in overseas employment,” Ople said. Around 58,400 or 3.2% of the 1.83 million OFWs around the world are in Japan as of 2021, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority. Ople said in a January Malacañang briefing that the DMW aimed to deploy more workers in 2023, noting that the Philippines fielded 486,673 OFWs from July to November 2022. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Philippine leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday, September 13, defended his late father’s imposition of martial law when in power, saying it was necessary because he was simultaneously fighting communist and separatist rebellions at that time. Marcos, son of Ferdinand E. Marcos who was overthrown in a 1986 popular uprising, said his father declared martial law not to stay in power but because the “government had to defend itself.” “Martial law was declared because of the wars, the two wars we were fighting on two fronts,” Marcos said in his first interview since his landslide victory in a May election. “Those were the dangers, the perils the country was facing,” Marcos said, as various groups including victims of human rights abuses, prepare to mark the 50th anniversary of the declaration of martial law on September 21. His remarks are likely to bolster the concerns of critics that Marcos Jr has no intention of distancing himself from the tenure of his father and that this could pose risks to democracy in the Philippines. In his televised interview, Marcos Jr denied accusations that he and his family were distorting history. During the campaign, critics said his presidential bid was an attempt to rewrite history by whitewashing corruption and authoritarianism associated with his father’s 20-year rule. The elder Marcos and his family fled the uprising against his rule after he had overseen what many historians have described as one of the worst examples of a kleptocracy in Asia. The Marcos patriarch died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, but his family later returned to launch a comeback that culminated in his son’s election victory in May. Decades later, more than 11,000 victims of martial law have received reparations from Philippines authorities paid for using billions of dollars of recovered wealth plundered by the ousted Marcos . Wiping away tears as he spoke, the incumbent Marcos recalled visiting his father’s grave a day after winning the election and calling on him for help. “I will use everything I learned from you to continue your work,” Marcos recounted telling his late father. Bonifacio Ilagan, who was jailed and tortured during Martial Law, said the late leader stayed in power for 14 years after imposing martial law, dismissing any suggestion it was due to an emergency situation. “Marcos Jr became president on the wings of false narratives and negative historical revisionism,” Ilagan said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte’s approval numbers took a double-digit plunge in the latest survey by pollster Pulse Asia, although they still continue to have majority support. “[Their numbers are] possibly affected by continuous increase in the cost of rice, gasoline, other basic commodities and services,” Pulse Asia President Ronald Holmes told Rappler on Monday, October 2. From 80% back in June, Marcos’ approval score slid by 15 percentage points, resulting in a 65% rating in September. Duterte’s approval rating dropped to 73% in September, an 11-percentage point drop compared to the 84% score she had in June. The tumble was felt across all socioeconomic classes and key geographic areas. For Marcos, the biggest drop in approval – 29 percentage points to be exact – was seen among the country’s poorest, Class E. In Duterte’s case, she lost 18 percentage points among Class ABC. From June to September, Marcos’ disapproval score increased by an average of six points, while Duterte by an average of three points. The two registered the highest uptick in disapproval rating in the Visayas – Marcos by nine percentage points, Duterte by five percentage points. Some 25% of respondents were undecided for Marcos; 8% were undecided for Duterte. Pulse Asia saw it as an increase in ambivalence toward their performances in office. The survey was released on Monday, and conducted from September 10 to 14 among 1,200 respondents. It has a margin of error of ± 2.8%. Key issues in the run-up to and during the conduct of the survey include the confidential fund fiasco, rising tensions in the West Philippine Sea brought about by China’s efforts to block a Filipino resupply mission in Ayungin Shoal, the rice crisis, inflation, and school opening woes, among others. Romualdez no longer enjoys the approval of the majority across all geographic locations except in the Visayas. On the average, only 41% of respondents said they approved of his performance in September, compared to his 52% approval score in June. His approval score saw a 15-percentage-point drop in Mindanao, the bailiwick of Duterte, whom he was rumored to have a rift with earlier this year. Supreme Court Chief Justice Alexander Gesmundo’s approval score also decreased by 11 points. Among the country’s five highest officials, only Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri’s approval score saw a single-digit drop – from 56% in June to 50% in September. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Lawyer Michael Poa announced on Tuesday, November 5, that he is no longer the spokesperson of Vice President Sara Duterte. Poa shared this development amid intense congressional scrutiny over alleged fund misuse by the Vice President. “I would like to inform the honorable committee that I am no longer connected with the Office of the Vice President,” Poa said when Manila 3rd District Representative Joel Chua asked him about his current role in the Office of the Vice President. Poa said that the OVP has pre-terminated his consultancy contract as spokesperson. Rappler reached out to the OVP for more details but they have yet to respond as of this posting. We will update this story once we receive their reply. Prior to his role at the OVP, Poa was Duterte’s chief of staff and spokesperson at the Department of Education. He resigned from the DepEd when the Vice President relinquished the agency’s leadership in June. He was appointed as OVP spokesperson in August. Poa also previously served as the chief of staff of the Government Service Insurance System, and as a member of the GSIS Editorial Board from 2011 to 2013. In the October 17 House hearing, Poa revealed that he had sought certification from the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to justify the use of DepEd’s confidential funds for youth leadership summits despite the agency’s lack of direct involvement in the military-led event. Poa had also admitted “occassionally” receiving envelopes with cash from the Vice President. He said that he received an envelope in December 2022, explaining that, as the DepEd spokesperson, he had occasionally used his own money to assist individuals who sought help from his office. Poa has been attending the House probe, while other OVP officials have consistently skipped the four hearings. – Rappler.com",

Edgar Dennis A. Pademal and Atty. Manases R. Carpio is DISMISSED for lack of merit,” the resolution issued by the High Court’s First Division said. The resolution was issued on June 14, but made public only on July 27. The case stemmed from an administrative complaint filed by spouses Alfredo and Lumenaria Honegger with the Integrated Bar of the Philippines-Commission on Bar Discipline (IBP-CBD) against Carpio and Padernal. The two lawyers represented clients, who filed complaints against the Honegger couple. In filing the complaint against Carpio and Padernal, the couple claimed that the two lawyers “violated the Lawyer’s Oath when they deliberately assisted in the filing and prosecution of cases that they knew were baseless just to harass and oppress another.” On January 15, 2021, the IBP-CBD issued a report and recommendation, dismissing the complaint against the two lawyers. In its ruling, the SC said it adopted the IBP-CBD’s resolution, adding that the complainants “failed to adduce any evidence to support their claim that the cases filed against them were merely intended to vex and harass.” The High Court said Carpio and Padernal’s mere filing of cases against the couple did not constitute unethical conduct that deserved administrative punishment. The two lawyers were allowed to resort to any legal means to protect their clients’ interests, the SC said. “The Code of Professional Responsibility, in fact, expects nothing less from lawyers of clients with legitimate grievances.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Key aides who worked for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s campaign are now part of the Presidential Communications Office (PCO), following an executive order that restructured and streamlined the agency. In a post on Thursday, February 16, the PCO said the following were now officials of the communications arm of the administration: The three undersecretaries of the PCO – Mercado, Imperial, and Baria – are existing undersecretaries in the Marcos administration. Mercado was under the Presidential Management Staff, and Imperial and Baria were under the Office of the President. Mercado is a long-time communications aide to Marcos, from at least his years as a senator. She also handled Marcos’ communications in his failed bid for the vice presidency in 2016. In 2022, Mercado worked mostly as a political aide in the presidential campaign. Imperial, meanwhile, was also part of the Marcos 2022 campaign team and was one of the “preparations committee heads” for the President’s oath-taking. He was later appointed executive director of Presidential Broadcast Staff-Radio Television Malacañang or RTVM, an agency that’s been moved from the Office of the President to the PCO. Baria is another member of the 2022 Marcos campaign team. His new post in the PCO is one that’s familiar to him – he also produced content for the Marcos campaign. The reorganization of the PCO comes months after Marcos’ first communications chief, vlogger Trixie Cruz-Angeles, exited the Palace after being bypassed by the Commission on Appointments. Under Angeles, the communications arm of the administration was renamed the Office of the Press Secretary. Following her exit and through an executive order that restructured the Office of the President, the communications arm was renamed Presidential Communications Office. Angeles had eight undersecretaries under her, even as several agencies – RTVM and the Philippine Information Agency (PIA), among others – were moved to the Office of the President. The PCO, now under Secretary Cheloy Garafil, is a slimmer organization. Executive Order Number 16, issued on February 13, authorizes only five undersecretaries in the PCO. Executive Order Number 16 authorizes the PCO to have 14 assistant secretaries. The OPS under Angeles was authorized at least 9 assistant secretaries – one under each undersecretary and another under the Office of the Secretary. EO No. 16 also states that the PCO is to coordinate with the Presidential Adviser for Creative Communications, an office created for Marcos’ godson, film director Paul Soriano. RTVM, PIA, the Freedom of Information-Program Management Office, and the Bureau of Communications Service have also been returned to the PCO. The changes in the PCO is parallel to another major change: of Marcos taking on a new executive secretary or “Little President” in former Supreme Court Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin. Previously, lawyer Vic Rodriguez, Marcos’ campaign spokesperson and chief of staff, held the post. Rodriguez, like Cruz, resigned from his post barely three months into the new administration. Their exit followed major controversies – in Rodriguez’ case, the alleged failure to fill in posts in the bureaucracy and the sugar importation fiasco; in Cruz’s case, gaffes that included falsely claiming that Marcos was US President Joe Biden’s only bilateral meeting while in New York for the United Nations General Assembly. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Recognizing the crucial role of teachers in country’s battle against learning crisis, Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte promised more benefits for them to ensure effective delivery of education to millions of Filipino students. At her second basic education report on Thursday, January 25, Duterte said that the Department of Education (DepEd) will release on Friday, January 26, an order containing guidelines on the removal of administrative tasks from teachers so they could focus on teaching. “To ensure its effective implementation, along with the filling up of 5,000 administrative personnel for 2023 and another 5,000 administrative personnel for 2024, we will also be providing additional MOOE (maintenance and other operating expenses) to enable our schools to hire the necessary administrative support staff,” Duterte said. It can be recalled that Duterte already mentioned the removal of administrative tasks from teachers’ workload in her last report in 2023. DepEd spokesman Michael Poa said that it took DepEd a year to issue such policy because they needed time to study its implementation. For years, teachers have complained that paperwork piling up hinders them from preparing lessons. The Vice President also said that the DepEd would provide overtime pay for teachers. “Historically, for non-teaching tasks performed outside their regular working hours, teachers are only compensated through service credits. In the next budget cycle, DepEd will be proposing a budget that will enable us to grant overtime pay to our teachers,” she said. Besides overtime pay, Duterte also said that the department would issue a policy on overload pay. “We want to ensure that our teachers are rightfully compensated for hours of actual classroom teaching beyond the 6-hour limit provided under the Magna Carta for teachers,” the Vice President said. Education experts cited overworked teachers as among the reasons behind the Philippines’ high level of learning poverty. The Vice President also boasted that the DepEd had already provided insurance for its 900,000 teaching and non-teaching personnel. “We purchased Personal Accident Insurance from the GSIS for all DepEd teachers and personnel. The insurance cover seeks to ease the financial burden on our teachers when accidents occur,” Duterte said. For two consecutive years, Duterte had put a spotlight on teachers’ welfare during her education report. “Teachers’ welfare will always be at the forefront of our agenda,” she said. – Rappler.com",

    "article_type": "NewsArticle",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – A long-time friend of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. significantly bankrolled the chief executive’s Malacañang aspirations, based on his official list of campaign donors. Marcos’ statement of contribution and expenditures (SOCE) officially released by the Commission on Elections (Comelec) to Rappler on Tuesday, August 30, indicated a total of 67 donors, 20 of which gave Marcos at least P10 million each, either in cash or in-kind. Here’s a quick look at some of them. Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo contributed P247.324 million to the Marcos campaign, putting him on top of the list. His donation was categorized as “in-kind from party.” Lagdameo is treasurer of Partido Federal ng Pilipinas (PFP), which previously disclosed that it spent P272 million to make Marcos win. Lagdameo is a three-term congressman from Davao del Norte, a businessman, and the husband of veteran actress Dawn Zulueta. He is the nephew of Antonio “Tony Boy” Floirendo Jr., the top campaign donor of former president Rodrigo Duterte in 2016. During the Martial Law era, his grandfather, banana magnate Antonio Floirendo Sr., was a crony of President Marcos Jr.’s father, the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. A distant second in the list is Melquiades Robles, who has been tapped by Marcos to be the general manager of the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office (PCSO). He was chief of the Light Rail Transit Authority during the Arroyo administration, and in 2017, the Sandiganbayan ordered to have him arrested over alleged irregularities on a 2009 janitorial contract, although he was acquitted two years later. He was also a board member of state media outfit Intercontinental Broadcast Corporation and spokesperson of El Shaddai head Mike Velarde. Ranking third is Philip G. Lo, who once served in the board of directors of the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor). In 2013, the Commission on Audit found Lo and eight other former Pagcor officials liable for the anomalous purchase of tickets worth P26.7 million for the 2008 movie Baler, although the Supreme Court reversed that ruling in 2021 and said the COA “acted with grave abuse of discretion.” For the complete list of Marcos’ donors, see the table below: Based on the table above, six people donated P20 million each to the Marcos campaign, while 11 other people contributed P10 million each. Some of Marcos’ donors are notable names in the Philippines’ business landscape, including: In total, the chief executive received contributions worth P624.684 million. Marcos, in his SOCE, declared a total expenditure of P623.23 million for his presidential campaign, none of which was paid out of his own pocket. That figure is just below the P674-million cap that presidential aspirants can utilize to woo voters during the campaign period. Based on Marcos’ summary report of lawful expenditures, half of the P623 million, or P313.592 million, was spent on ads. Around P221 million was used to employ poll watchers. The table below shows Marcos’ expenditures per category. A report by the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism in July said Marcos appeared in ads worth P1.09 billion during the 90-day campaign period from February to May, based on available rate cards. The PCIJ, however, clarified that the exact ad expenses could be lower due to the discounts that candidates could avail of. – Rappler.com",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Bus companies face the cancellation or suspension of their public transportation franchises after some of their drivers and conductors tested positive for illegal drug use. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) did not identify the bus companies, but said they will be ordered to explain after the Holy Week holiday. LTFRB said the drivers and conductors tested positive for illegal drug use during a nationwide screening conducted by the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency. READ: 2 dead, 9 hurt as vehicle rams Good Friday procession in Bacolod The drug tests, held on April 16 under “Oplan: Harabas,” covered major land transport terminals across the country. The LTFRB said that of the 3,270 individuals tested, 84 public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and two conductors yielded positive results. Among those who tested positive were 13 bus drivers, one mini-bus driver, 19 jeepney drivers, 47 tricycle drivers, one taxi driver, two motorcycle taxi riders and 11 UV Express drivers. Two conductors also tested positive for illegal drug use. In a statement, LTFRB Chair Teofilo Guadiz III said the agency “takes the results seriously and will act swiftly to hold accountable those who put public safety at risk.” “It is unacceptable and deeply troubling that individuals entrusted with the safety of passengers are found to be operating vehicles under the influence of prohibited substances,” he added. “[The bus companies] will be required to explain why no sanction should be imposed upon them for employing drivers who pose a clear risk to public safety.” Guadiz reminded operators that they are duty-bound to ensure that their drivers are fit to operate public transport vehicles, both physically and mentally. Failure to comply with these responsibilities, he said, may result in penalties, including possible suspension or cancellation of their franchises. Data analysis Also on Saturday, the Land Transportation Office (LTO) said it would be conducting a “comprehensive data analysis of traffic accidents and road rage cases in the country.” The goals is to come out with a improved government intervention from regulations and law enforcement to infrastructure review and recommendations. The study and analysis will focus on three main factors of road accidents—human or motorist factor, motor vehicle factor and infrastructure factor. “The intention is to maximize the cooperation and coordination among government agencies,” LTO chief Vigor Mendoza II said in a statement. Mendoza cited 2024 data from the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, which showed over 31,000 road accidents involving some 47,200 vehicles. There were 2,747 road accident fatalities in 2024 compared to 2,030 fatalities in 2023. The PNP data also said 27,248 or 87.17 percent of the road accidents were caused by reckless driving such as bad overtaking, improper turning, speeding, drunk driving, overloading and using mobile phones while driving. The same data also showed that 790 road accidents were attributed to motor vehicle condition while 725 cases were caused by poor road conditions. Last year, the LTO launched the “Stop Road Crash” advocacy aimed at achieving the goal set by the Marcos administration to reduce road accidents in the country by at least 35 percent by 2028.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — With the insurance coverage of the sunken MT Princess Empress facing a snag due to controversy surrounding its authority to travel, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) has sought the assistance of the International Oil Pollution Compensation (IOPC) Funds to boost the country’s efforts in cleaning up the oil spill. In a statement on Friday, the PCG said it will seek help from the IOPC Funds to help speed up the acquisition of its own remotely-operated vehicles (ROVs). It cited how the ROV Hakuyo released by the Japanese Dynamic Positioning Vessel Shin Nichi Maru was able to immediately pinpoint the location of the sunken oil tanker under the waters off Naujan in Oriental Mindoro province. The Japanese ROV was also able to confirm that oil leaks were observed from all its eight compartments, containing 900,000 of industrial fuel oil. The IOPC Funds are made up of two intergovernmental organizations, the 1992 Fund and the 2003 Supplementary Fund Protocol, which provide compensation for oil pollution damage resulting from spills of persistent oil from tankers. The Philippines country acceded to the IOPC Funds in 1997, which the Senate ratified two years later. According to the IOPC, a delegation representing the Philippine government visited the IOPC Funds’ offices in London on March 15 to meet with the director and a member of its claims department. In a statement, the IOPC said it was “monitoring developments closely” and would make a report to the 1992 Fund Convention executive committee in May. “However, it is too early to determine whether the Convention would apply to this incident at this stage,” it noted. The PCG filed a compensation request with the IOPC Funds for the cleanup of the oil spill in Guimaras province in August 2006, considered the worst in Philippine history, where the agreed compensation amounted to P104.7 million.A Senate inquiry last week, however, found that the Princess Empress may not even be covered by insurance because of irregularities in the vessel’s documentation. According to the Maritime Industry Authority (Marina), MT Princess Empress had no updated permit when it capsized on Feb. 28, and sank the following day after experiencing engine trouble, because the tanker’s owner, RDC Reield Marine Services (RDC), had yet to amend its original certificated of public convenience.

Opposition lawmaker Rep. Edcel Lagman on Friday pressed Congress to exercise its power of the purse and ensure that such funds will be transparently audited. In a statement, Edcel Lagman suggested that the bulk of the confidential and intel funds “must be included, if ever, in the agencies’ maintenance and other operating expenses.” This is “to assure the regular and transparent auditing process, rather than the present furtive auditing procedures behind closed doors between the audited and the auditor,” he said. P4.5 billion goes to OP Earlier, Edcel Lagman told the Inquirer that he would continue his advocacy against “the profligate allocations for confidential and intelligence funds in the President’s 2024 National Expenditure Program (NEP), the excess fat of which must be excised and reallocated to socioeconomic services, particularly education and health.” A check of the 2024 NEP submitted to Congress showed that a total of P10.141 billion in confidential and intel funds was tucked into the proposed P5.768 trillion national budget. Of the P10.141 billion, P4.56 billion or almost half of the sum is being requested by the Office of the President.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The death toll from the capsized bulk carrier carrying 25 crew members off Rizal town in Occidental Mindoro has risen to six after two more bodies were recovered on Good Friday, according to the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). The PCG said the first body was found by Special Operations Group divers at 2:10 p.m. at the MV Hong Hai 16’s accommodation area, while the second body was recovered at 3:28 p.m. in the cargo area. The agency earlier clarified that despite its name, the Hong Hai 16 was actually a Philippine-flagged vessel operated by Kean Peaks Corp., but the agency did not reveal more details. The vessel was dredging sand when it capsized about 100 meters off Barangay Malawaan in Rizal town on Holy Tuesday. The vessel had a crew of 25 members, including 13 Filipinos and 12 Chinese nationals. READ: Oriental Mindoro oil spill affects nearly 173,000 people — NDRRMC Out of the 25 crew members, the PCG said 14 were rescued while rescuers searched for the remaining 11 crewmen. With six bodies accounted, five are still missing. On Wednesday, a Filipino crew member and Chinese national were found dead following the search-and-rescue operations by the PCG and concerned agencies. Two more bodies were found on Thursday, before two others were found on Friday. No environmental threat According to the PCG, “no significant environmental threat has been identified” after oil-spill containment booms were placed to prevent a possible environmental hazard. The PCG initially reported that the vessel was carrying about 2,000 liters of lube oil and 30,000 liters of automotive diesel oil, when it capsized. But the coast guard said surface monitoring conducted on Holy Saturday showed no traces of an oil spill in the vicinity. In coordination with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the PCG said a water sampling was conducted and sent for laboratory analysis to ensure continued environmental safety in the vicinity. The operator of the Hong Hai 16, identified as Kean Peak Corp., has contracted a professional salvor to undertake salvage operations, the PCG said. The salvor’s equipment, it added, was expected to arrive onsite on Monday. In February 2023, a tanker carrying 800,000 liters of industrial fuel sank 369 meters, about 14 kilometers northeast of Balisangan Point, Pola, Oriental Mindoro.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said on Tuesday that a resolution at the House of Representatives urging the government to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) in its investigation of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s drug war needs to be studied thoroughly. “Needs a serious study on our part at the Department of Justice, considering we are no longer [a] member [of the Rome Statute],” he added. Earlier, he said the Department of Justice (DOJ) was also studying a call from the Makabayan bloc to let the international tribunal enter the country to pursue its investigation of Duterte. House Resolution No. 1477, filed on Monday by Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr., House human rights panel chair, and 1-Rider Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez of the minority bloc, urges government agencies to cooperate with ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan. The resolution’s filing happened a month after the three Makabayan lawmakers filed a similar resolution. Their resolution cited the former President’s admission in a television show last October that he used intelligence funds to bankroll extrajudicial killings in Davao City. Additional evidence This televised admission was sent by the Magdalo group to the ICC as additional evidence against Duterte and his war on illegal drugs, which left thousands of suspects dead. “The Philippine government’s initial request for the ICC prosecutor to defer its investigation and the Philippine government’s subsequent petition before the ICC Appeals Chamber, clearly demonstrate that the Philippine government respects the rule of international law and recognizes the proceedings of the ICC,” HR 1477 said. It added that despite the Philippines’ withdrawal from the Rome Statute, the Supreme Court said the ICC retains jurisdiction “over any and all acts committed by government actors until March 17, 2019.” The resolution was referred to the House justice committee for action. On March 16, 2018, the Philippines submitted its notice of withdrawal from the Rome Statute after the ICC opened a preliminary examination into Duterte’s alleged crimes against humanity in the conduct of his anti-drug campaign. The withdrawal became official on March 17, 2019.",

    "article_body": "The five-man panel tasked to review the directed “courtesy resignations” of top Philippine National Police officials has assured anxious generals and colonels that they will be given “final closure” if they really have nothing to do with drug syndicates, according to Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong. Magalong, who served in the PNP for 38 years before being elected Baguio mayor in 2019, will form part of the committee, but the panel has not convened even as they awaited the resignation of 24 officials who have yet to comply with the order of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos. In a bid to weed out police officials involved in the narcotics trade, Abalos on Jan. 4 asked top PNP officials to submit their courtesy resignations by Jan. 31. PNP chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr., who submitted his own courtesy resignation on Jan. 5, said a total of 936 colonels and generals, or 98 percent of all the 952 high-ranking officials, have submitted their resignations as of Wednesday. The number was previously at 956, but four of the officials have since retired. According to Azurin, two generals and five colonels were contemplating not to comply with the order since they are set to retire next month anyway. “But I encouraged them to submit anyway, so they could have peace of mind. They have served the PNP for more than 30 years so they deserve to have their names cleared once and for all,” Azurin said in a radio interview. Azurin earlier said less than 10 high-ranking police officials are believed to be involved in illegal drugs, but he declined to say whether those officials had already submitted their resignations. Still, Azurin hoped all the 952 police officials would tender their courtesy resignation by the Jan. 31 deadline. Magalong also said on Tuesday that he met with unidentified senior PNP officers to address their “anxieties and apprehensions” about the resignation and the screening process. The committee is close to finishing the guidelines to be used by the committee and assured anxious officials that they will be given a fair shake and “formal closure,” he added. “This means that, if you are cleared by the committee, this should not just be a verbal clearing,” Magalong said. “Many are asking that we give them something concrete that proves it.” Magalong said that the screening process will be completed within 30 days because that is the requirement of the Civil Service Commission. The 30-day period will start when the committee convenes.",

    "article_body": "The Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) is eyeing the nationwide implementation by 2026 of the capitation payment scheme in its accredited hospitals and health facilities, according to its spokesperson Israel Pargas. Under this model which is being pilot tested in selected areas, the state health insurer will advance to a public health facility a P500 capitation fee for every accredited patient. For private clinics, it will be P750 each. “In this kind of payment scheme, we will distribute [the payments] first to make sure that the facilities have funds and they have no reason to tell members that they don’t have medicines or money, and that they can’t provide services,” Pargas told the Inquirer. The new “frontloading” scheme was launched in July in public health facilities in Bataan, Guimaras, Quezon and South Cotabato provinces, as well as in Baguio City. It is part of PhilHealth’s efforts to veer away from current reimbursement mechanisms in which services are rendered first to members before health-care providers may apply for claims from the agency. PhilHealth, however, has been criticized for its slow processing of claims and obligations filed by accredited health-care providers. As of now, the unpaid claims have ballooned to about P27 billion. This issue was also raised at the House of Representatives last week during a hearing on the proposed 2024 budget of the Department of Health, of which PhilHealth is an attached agency. To expedite the payment of arrears to hospitals, Pargas said that PhilHealth may adopt a debit-credit payment method which was successfully used to settle claims during the COVID-19 pandemic. gsg",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — After 27 years, the Philippines has lifted the guarantee bond imposed on Singaporean recruiters and employers of domestic workers since the public anger over the Flor Contemplacion case in 1995. Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople announced the abolition of the guarantee and performance bond during her courtesy call on Manpower Minister Tan See Leng on Wednesday, during the state visit of President Marcos to Singapore. “The removal of the requirements was in recognition of the deep and abiding friendship between the Republic of the Philippines and the Republic of Singapore and was a concrete outcome of the historic first state visit of Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.,” the two agencies said in a joint press statement issued afterward. “There was never an occasion for the Philippine overseas labor office in Singapore to garnish the bond in favor of an aggrieved worker in the past because complaints are promptly handled by the Ministry of Manpower which strictly monitors its accredited recruitment agencies,” Ople said in a separate statement. Contemplacion became the face of overseas Filipino workers in distress when she was sentenced to death by a Singaporean court in January 1993 for the murder of her fellow Filipino domestic worker, Delia Maga and Maga’s 4-year-old ward in May 1991. The public outcry intensified when Contemplacion was executed by hanging on March 17, 1995, despite then President Fidel Ramos’ plea for clemency, causing a rift in diplomatic relations. As part of the fallout, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration levied a bond against Singaporean recruitment agencies and employers hiring Filipinos as domestic workers. The bond was applied only to Singapore. ‘Christmas in September’ According to Ople, her counterpart Minister Tan described the lifting of the required bond as “Christmas in September” because they have been lobbying for the past 27 years to have it removed. She said the “goodwill” from President Marcos’ state visit and the lifting of the 27-year-old guarantee bond “will lead to more and better job prospects for Filipinos who wish to work in Singapore.” According to the Department of Migrant Workers, as of December last year, around 215,155 Filipinos live and work in Singapore, of which 180,605 are temporary migrants.

Since Saturday, Mayon’s lava flow has increased up to 1.5 kilometers from the crater. It also recorded 274 rockfall events, three volcanic earthquakes, and 11 pyroclastic density currents. “Very slow effusion of lava flow to maximum lengths of 1.5 km and lava collapse on Mi-isi and Bonga Gullies within 3.3 km from the crater,” Phivolcs reported in its 5 a.m. bulletin. Mayon Volcano remains under alert level 3 with “intensified or magmatic unrest.” Phivolcs added that the volcano released 1,004 metric tons of sulfur dioxide. Its continuous degassing from the crater, meanwhile, produced steam-laden plumes reaching 100 meters. Due to this development, the state volcanology agency warned the public that “rockfalls or landslides or avalanches; ballistic fragments; lava flows and lava fountaining; pyroclastic density currents; moderate-sized explosions; and lahars during heavy and prolonged rainfall” may occur within the area. The 7-km radius permanent danger zone was also reinforced along with the prohibition on flying any aircraft close to the volcano. Around 20,000 people living in communities surrounding Mayon were evacuated to 28 shelters in Albay after it was placed under alert level 2. No deaths and injuries have been reported, but disaster risk and reduction agencies estimated around 40,000 people to have been affected.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rommel Marbil on Wednesday defended a PNP convoy’s use of the Edsa busway the previous night, saying the officers in the vehicles needed to rush to Camp Crame for an “emergency meeting.” But Marbil posed no objections to the PNP vehicles being flagged down by civilian enforcers and issued tickets for the lane violation, a hot-button issue, especially for motorists barred from using the busway. The PNP chief also didn’t confirm or deny whether he was in the convoy. READ: PNP: Convoy caught using Edsa busway carrying ‘senior officers’ On Tuesday night, members of the Department of Transportation’s (DOTr) Special Action and Intelligence Committee for Transportation (SAICT) stopped a convoy—made up of two sport utility vehicles and Highway Patrol Group motorcycles—as it passed through the Ortigas section of the busway going north. Based on videos that later circulated online, the PNP convoy personnel asked the SAICT team to let them pass through since the “PNP chief” needed to reach Camp Crame immediately for an emergency meeting. Chinese kidnapping case In a radio interview, Marbil declined to say whether he was in the convoy, citing security concerns after the plate numbers of the vehicles were shown to the public in the videos and subsequent media reports. But he explained that there was indeed an urgent meeting at the camp that required the presence of ranking PNP officials. The meeting was about a Chinese national who was kidnapped on Thursday last week and found on Tuesday night. “There was an emergency and an issue that we had to resolve yesterday... We needed the presence of our police higher-ups because we had a closed-door meeting because something happened during the operation last night,” he said. As to the PNP convoy being flagged down, Marbil said the DOTr enforcers were “just doing their job.” “We have to respect them. If the police got caught, get the ticket. We’re all just doing our jobs,” he added. PNP spox: It was allowable Earlier on Wednesday, PNP spokesperson Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo said opening the Edsa busway to police vehicles is actually allowed during emergencies. “There is a provision in the guidelines that when PNP officers are in an urgent situation and [an] emergency, they can use the Edsa busway,” Fajardo said. “(Those in the) convoy didn’t argue anymore and just appealed to let our officer be taken to Camp Crame first.

Department of Health (DOH) officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said all COVID-19 vaccines that were nearing expiry have been given extended shelf life after consultation by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with the manufacturers. “There is no truth that what we are distributing as booster shots for COVID-19 doses are expired,” she said in a news conference at the DOH headquarters on Monday. “Everybody knows this. When these vaccines were near expiry, we coordinated with FDA so they can coordinate with the manufacturers to determine if they can extend the shelf life,” she explained, adding that the decision to extend the shelf life of the vaccines underwent careful study. “So whatever we are distributing now to our communities are vaccines within expiry dates, meaning they are still effective and safe because we were able to extend their shelf life,” she said. Vergeire admitted that the expiry date labels on the vaccines that are nearing expiry were not replaced “because many of the manufacturers have stopped production already so we cannot return these vials to change the expiry dates on their label.” RELATED STORIES DOH: Some COVID booster shots not expired but have ‘extended shelf life’ DOH pressed: Who answers for expired vaccines?

Duterte, who is also education secretary, said they already had an initial meeting with some lawmakers to discuss proposals for the return of the mandatory ROTC. “During our discussion, I think it was clear to everyone that it is better to return ROTC to higher education since it was already there before,” Duterte told reporters on Thursday. “The basic education will focus on other parts of the curriculum that will instill discipline and love of country for our learners,” she added. Michael Poa, spokesperson for the Department of Education , said on Friday, “nothing is final yet” regarding the mandatory ROTC, which was scrapped in 2002. Commission on Higher Education chair Prospero de Vera III has yet to comment on the latest development, but in August, he announced a plan to implement an optional “advanced” ROTC program in college to supposedly complement the mandatory ROTC in senior high school. —DEXTER CABALZA RELATED STORIES DND assures House lawmakers: ROTC is not militaristic ‘Big chance’ mandatory ROTC bill will pass 19th Congress —Gatchalian ChEd backs return of mandatory ROTC",

He is also facing grave charges, such as multiple murder and all of that is a reality [lawyer Ferdinand] Topacio and his client should face,” Remulla said in a statement. The Department of Justice (DOJ) chief issued this in response to a circulating letter allegedly from Teves seeking the intervention of the United Nations, Amnesty International and other human rights groups, claiming he was being unjustly persecuted and falsely accused. READ: Degamo widow calls Teves’ alleged release a ‘media stunt’ According to Remulla, the government has already guaranteed the protection of the former Negros Oriental representative, who is evading legal proceedings in the Philippines for multiple charges, including murder, frustrated murder and attempted murder. He is accused of being the mastermind in the assassination of his political rival, former provincial Gov. Roel Degamo, and nine other individuals in Pamplona town on March 4, 2023. Proof of threat “Prove us wrong that you are not merely employing tactics intended to delay or circumvent the Rule of Law by presenting ‘real’ and ‘existing’ proof that Teves’ life is in danger. Otherwise, submit yourselves to Philippine jurisdiction,” Remulla told Topacio. Teves was arrested by authorities on March 21 while playing golf in Timor-Leste based on a red alert notice issued by the International Criminal Police Organization. Topacio said on Tuesday that his client was not rearrested but only placed under the custody of the Timorese court in preparation for extradition proceedings after he was briefly released on Monday from preventive detention at the Becora Prison in Dili, Timor-Leste.",

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has approved a plan to redo a rice production program called “Masagana 99” that his father, deceased former President Ferdinand Marcos, implemented in 1973. The President explained to rice industry stakeholders on Wednesday, May 31, that the Masagana Rice Industry Development Program aims to reach 97.5 percent rice sufficiency in five years. “I don’t think it has to be 100 percent ... But I think 97.5 is a good enough number,” Marcos said during a Rice Industry Convergence Meeting in Quezon City. “You don’t have to really go to 100 percent because the 3 percent are other niche products, organic ones, special grains, Japanese rice, things like that,” he said. “At 97 percent, we can say that we can feed all our countrymen with enough rice and supplies,” Marcos added. READ: IN THE KNOW: Masagana 99 Press Secretary Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said the President made the announcement after he approved the program, obviously modeled after Masagana 99 which was implemented in 1973 amid a rice supply shortage. The program, executed alongside an intensified land reform drive, involved government-backed funding for new technologies developed by the International Rice Research Institute, founded only a decade prior. The program also involved the use of chemical fertilizers and insecticides that were later found to be harmful to health. READ: LP solon backs Marcos agri push, but says ‘Masagana 99’ must be tweaked By 1976, the government said farmers were producing bumper harvests unseen in generations—a claim still disputed today. Unpaid loans However, the lack of continuing support for the program caused inexperienced farmers to default on their loans, leading to the sale of farmland they had just received from the government and widespread bank failures. In a Senate hearing in 2020, former Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez III, who was agriculture secretary from 1987 to 1989, claimed that he “cleaned up a mess” of 800 rural banks going bankrupt because of unpaid loans. READ: Dominguez rebuts Marcos on Masagana 99 feat: ‘I cleaned up the mess’ However, as finance minister from 2016-2022, Dominguez was also responsible for the government’s policy of agricultural importation that ruined thousands of rice, corn, hog, chicken, and sugar farmers all over the country. Former Agriculture Secretary Emmanuel Piñol claimed that he advised against the long-term consequences of the all-out importation policy, but he was replaced. That episode also directly caused the crop shortages, whether real or imagined, that the country is experiencing at this time.

    "article_body": "Despite a whopping P7 billion subsidy from the government, the National Food Authority (NFA) has failed to meet the optimum level of rice buffer requirement of 300,000 metric tons (MT) last year, according to the Commission on Audit (COA).In its annual audit report, the COA found that the NFA had fallen short of 177,349 MT or 36.95 percent of the target palay procurement of 480,000 MT. Based on COA’s tabulation of NFA’s buffer stock levels for 2022, it showed that the agency was only able to get an average available stock of 140,354 MT, with a deficit of 159,646 MT. “The inability of the NFA to maintain the required buffer stock to an optimal level of national rice buffer stocking at any given time poses risk that the NFA might not be able to effectively and immediately respond and provide [for] the needs of the beneficiaries all over the country in times of emergency situations and nonsustenance of the disaster relief programs of the government during natural or man-made calamities,” the COA said. The failure to meet the buffer stock requirement happened despite the NFA’s full receipt of P7 billion worth of government subsidies. Of the amount, only P5.750 billion was disbursed for 302,651 MT of palay procured or 63.05 percent of the target 480,000 MT of palay for 2022, which was partly why the NFA failed to meet the rice buffer stock requirement. Low absorption This was also due to the low absorption rate of palay by NFA caused by, but not limited to, the higher farm-gate price of palay compared to NFA’s buying price of P19 per kilogram; the occurrence of strong typhoons in areas of major palay production; and intensified procurement strategies of private traders by offering more incentives such as free delivery, consignment, advance payment and free use of postharvest facilities. From its data, the COA said the NFA had an average absorption rate of only 1.54 percent of the total palay production of 19.767 million MT in the country, even though the NFA’s buying rate of palay of P19 per kilo was higher by 8.63 percent than the average farm gate price of P17.36. The low absorption rate, according to the COA, could be attributed to “inadequate information dissemination,” especially in the top three rice-producing regions including, Central Luzon, Cagayan Valley and Western Visayas.

Marcos met in Malacañang with SGS officials, led by vice president George Bottomley and local managing director Cresenciano Maramot, on Thursday to discuss SGS’ services to the government. SGS, which has recently been inspecting the country’s fuel imports, proposed to expand its services to include agricultural imports. “This scheme would minimize smuggling,” he said in a video statement after the meeting. “That means, before the product is loaded onto the ship at the place of origin, they will inspect it, so they can say: ‘This is true. The weight is correct. The quality is right. The record is correct’ ... We don’t have to do it [any more],” he added. The President said he would study the inclusion of agricultural imports, including a cost analysis to make sure that no added burden would be passed on to consumers. Press Secretary Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said the President ordered the Department of Finance and the Department of Agriculture to study the proposal. As in the government’s previous engagements with the company, the SGS system “would deter importers from manipulating or falsifying invoices and, instead, increase tax compliance and enable cross-agency trade data reconciliation.” g/",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Raffy Tulfo on Sunday questioned the supposed plan of the government to purchase vehicles from China to replace the country’s traditional jeepneys, claiming the move “reeks of corruption.” “China is already invading the West Philippine Sea. Will we allow them to take over even our roads?” Tulfo said in a statement. The radio broadcaster-turned-lawmaker said he received information that the government was planning to import modernized jeepneys from China for as much as P2.9 million per unit as part of the multibillion-peso modernization program for public utility vehicles. Tulfo pointed out that this was nearly triple the price of locally manufactured jeepneys that comply with the strict safety requirements mandated by the Department of Transportation (DOTr). He said Sarao Motors and Francisco Motors, two of the major jeepney manufacturers in the country, had earlier offered their vehicles for as low as P900,000. Local industry “[T]his project reeks of corruption considering that [the] local jeepney manufacturing industry can produce a quality modern jeepney at a lower cost,” he said. According to Tulfo, the government would be able to save P1.7 million for every vehicle it buys from a local manufacturer instead of importing from China. “Moreover,” he said, “if the cost of the jeepney to be purchased [locally] is around P900,000, the government will be able to [provide] subsidies to implement the modernization at no cost to the jeepney drivers and operators.” In addition, he said, supporting local vehicle makers would help provide jobs to thousands of Filipinos. Last week, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III urged the DOTr to identify the contractors who could rake in billions of pesos in profits for supplying the modernized jeepneys, which he said actually looked like minibuses. Drivers and operators of jeepneys and passenger vans were given until Dec. 31 to consolidate into cooperatives or corporations for them to be allowed to continue to ply their routes. Those who did not comply face the revocation of their franchises. Meanwhile, Liga ng Transportasyon at Operator ng Pilipinas national president Orlando Marquez said at a news forum in Quezon City on Saturday that the public utility vehicle modernization will solve the traffic problem in the metropolis similar to how Singapore addressed the same problem by introducing transport modernization. “We support this modernization because we want [in Metro Manila what happened] in developed countries like Singapore, which used to have a traffic problem. They modernized, they introduced mass transport, so they resolved the problem which had been costing [their economy],” he said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A total of 493 local governments are eligible for an incentive fund amounting to millions in recognition and support for high-performing provincial, city, and municipal governments in the country. In its yearend report, the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) said 28 provinces, 64 cities, and 401 municipalities received the Seal of Good Local Governance (SGLG) in an awarding ceremony on Dec. 14 in Manila. It has been the second year since the SGLG’s resumption following its deferment for two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This means 34 percent of the 82 provinces, 43 percent of the 148 cities, and 27 percent of 1,486 municipalities in the country are considered among the best in local governance. READ: 9 LGUs in Bicol bag ‘Seal of Good Local Governance’ award from DILG READ: DILG awards Seals of Good Local Governance to 350 LGUs Twenty-two of these local governments are seven-time awardees, after sustaining their good performance since 2015 when the SGLG was first conferred. Around 94 local governments have received the recognition for the first time. Each local government awardee will receive an SGLG marker and an incentive fund of P4 million for the province, P2.3 million for the cities, and P1.8 million for the municipalities to support their respective local development initiatives. The SGLG, enacted through Republic Act No. 11292 in 2019, is an institutionalized award, incentive, honor and recognition-based program that encourages the commitment of local governments to continuously progress and improve their performance in various areas of governance. For a local government to receive the SGLG, it must pass all 10 criteria: financial administration and sustainability; disaster preparedness; social protection and sensitivity; health compliance and responsiveness; sustainable education; business-friendliness and competitiveness; safety, peace and order; environmental management; tourism, heritage development, culture and arts; and youth development. The SGLG incentive fund, formerly known as the Performance Challenge Fund, will be taken from the annual government appropriations.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Take it from this former defense chief who led the uprising against the strongman he had served for so long. Former Defense Minister and former Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile, in response to those urging another uprising at the Edsa beltway to topple President Marcos, challenged them on Sunday, saying—Just do it. Enrile—who, together with then Vice Chief of Staff Fidel Ramos, led the 1986 People Power Revolution against the regime of Ferdinand Marcos Sr.—offered this unsolicited advice on Facebook after ralliers sympathetic to Vice President Sara Duterte had been gathering at Edsa Shrine since Tuesday. “My advice to the advocates of revolution or people power is to go ahead to a shop and buy your revolutionary or people power kit, and start the game you like if you really can do it,” said the man who helped topple Marcos Sr. but who now serves his son as presidential legal counsel. He said “revolution or people power is no bluffing matter. It is an ultima ratio, where there is no point of return.” “Ultima ratio” is a Latin phrase that means “the last resort” or “the final argument,” commonly used to describe a decisive action taken only after all other options have failed. “[Revolution] is a zero-sum game. Either you win or you lose. That’s it,” said the centenarian survivor of adversity in politics. ‘Exploitation of history’ The rector of the Archdiocesan Shrine of Mary, Queen of Peace, in Quezon City, better known as the iconic Edsa Shrine, again expressed concern about efforts to exploit the poor and the “People Power legacy” to garner support for political gain. “They once dismissed Edsa as a political tool of the ‘dilawan’ and ‘pink’ groups (those who supported the Aquino family and the 2022 presidential campaign of former Vice President Leni Robredo). But now they are calling the people to unite and gather at Edsa to oust the current government,” Fr. Jerome Secillano said on the “Facts First” podcast. The priest also maintained that contrary to the claim of the protesters, they were not being turned away to hold their program at the church property. But Secillano said he rejected the group’s plan to hold their program at the façade of Edsa Shrine at the corner of Edsa and Ortigas Avenue. “They also plan to build a platform to hold their program, which will block the view of the shrine. I did not allow it, because it is already an exploitation of history. I need to protect the interest of the church,” he said. DDS, vloggers As of Sunday morning, Philippine National Police spokesperson Brig. Gen. Jean Fajardo said no untoward incidents were reported since the so-called DDS, or “Diehard Duterte Supporters,” started gathering at Edsa Shrine on Tuesday. Six days since, these supporters are down to around 20, Fajardo said, adding that some 200 officers remain deployed there to keep the peace. According to Secillano, the ralliers at Edsa were mostly vloggers who wanted to post online content for their followers. The Edsa Shrine was established in December 1989 as a dedication to Mary, Queen of Peace, who is believed to have played a part in the largely peaceful People Power Revolution of 1986 that toppled the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos Sr., father of President Marcos.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Senator Sherwin Gatchalian on Thursday called for a thorough investigation into the latest data breach in a system under Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). Gatchalian said the incident “is deeply alarming.” “Nakakabahala na hindi pa nga nareresolba ang hacking na nangyari sa Philhealth (Philippine Health Insurance Corp.), isa na namang ahensya ng gobyerno ang nakompromiso sa online security,” he said in a statement. (It’s alarming that even before the hacking involving Philhealth has been resolved, another government agency's online security has been compromised.) “Nagpapakita lamang ito na hindi matatag ang imprastraktura sa bansa para labanan ang banta sa cybersecurity,” he added. (\"This just shows that the country's infrastructure is not strong enough to combat the threat to cybersecurity.) A “ransomware” attack hit the website and online application of PhilHealth on September 22. Acting on an alleged data leak on one of its systems, PSA disclosed Wednesday that the breach allegedly affected its Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS). But Gatchalian said, “This is crucial, as the CBMS contains essential personal information necessary for assessing poverty down to the barangay level.” He then prodded Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) and National Privacy Commission (NPC) to immediately identify those behind the CBMS hacking. “The DICT and NPC should undertake the necessary steps to ensure that the data breach will not compromise the safety and security of those covered by the CBMS,” said the senator. Gatchalian also believes this incident “highlights the pressing need for the DICT to have access to confidential funds.” Two of his colleagues in Senate — Majority Leader Joel Villanueva and Senator JV Ejercito — are already pushing for the retention of the proposed P300 million confidential fund of DICT for 2024. The secret fund was earlier deleted in the House of Representatives.

It cited Metro Manila and the Ilocos and Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon) regions as having the biggest increase in leptospirosis infections, accumulating a total of 441 cases in the last four weeks. Infections also rose in the Cordillera, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, and Palawan), Bicol, Western Visayas, Eastern Visayas and Davao regions last month. A total of 3,325 infections in the country had been reported from January to Aug. 19, based on the DOH’s latest data.At least 359 people died due to leptospirosis during the same period, or a case fatality rate of 10.8 percent. “Continuous monitoring must be done as cases may still increase with late reports,” said the DOH. Leptospirosis is usually transmitted to humans from water contaminated by animal urine, particularly from rats, and comes in contact with lesions in the skin or eyes. Symptoms include fever, chills, and severe headache, which usually appear four to 14 days following exposure to contaminated floodwaters or mud. —KATHLEEN DE VILLA RELATED STORIES DOH sees more dengue, leptospirosis cases Leptospirosis cases surge 51% in first 7 months Leptospirosis cases in Iloilo up by 296 percent",

    "article_body": "The Department of Energy (DOE) is ramping up its monitoring efforts to make sure oil companies fully comply with the government’s order to increase their biofuel blend aimed at cutting dependence on imported fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The implementation of a 3-percent coco methyl ester (CME) blend, from 2 percent previously, in diesel fuel sold nationwide took effect on Oct. 1. Based on the DOE website, CME is defined as fatty acid methyl esters derived from coconut oil “whose alkyl groups range in varying percentages from C8 to C18 suitable for compression ignition engines and other similar types of engines.” READ: Higher biodiesel blend: Countdown begins “Oil companies have been given ample time to make this adjustment, and the OIMB (Oil Industry Management Bureau) will now conduct inspections at bulk depots to enforce compliance,” Energy Undersecretary Alessandro Sales said in a statement on Friday. P200,000 fine “Timely action at the depot level is crucial to maintaining an up-to-date and efficient fuel distribution chain,” he added. The planned inspections would also be expanded to cover gasoline stations “in the coming weeks,” the DOE said. It said those found noncompliant, including fuel retailers in possession of biofuel blend that do not meet the national standards, would be slapped with a fine reaching P200,000. Repeat offenders would see an even higher penalty of P300,000. The DOE may also decide to revoke their accreditation or registration. READ: October opens with oil price hikes, new biodiesel blend Citing data from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Carbon Emission Calculator, the 3-percent CME blend would displace around 300 million liters of pure diesel every year, subsequently slashing 1.11 percent in carbon emissions or around 298.2 kilotons of carbon dioxide. Besides the positive environmental impact, the DOE also said it would benefit coconut farmers, biodiesel producers and other players in the sector as more than 900 million coconuts would be needed to produce the CME requirements. The government is targeting to further raise the biodiesel mix to 4 percent after a year and 5 percent by October 2026. In September, the DOE also said that it was looking at initiating talks with the National Power Corp. on the possibility of increasing the biodiesel blend for fuel used in power generation.",

    "article_body": "A day after he effectively rejected Beijing’s warning on the country’s security and disaster relief agreement with the United States, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday lauded Chinese-Filipino businessmen and exhorted them to continue helping in Philippine economic development. “I only ask that you continue to do what you do best: to remain industrious, innovative and compassionate in improving the lives of our people through your business initiatives,” the President told members of the Federation of the Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and Industry Inc. (FFCCCII) in Pasay City. Marcos did not mention the Philippine-US Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement in his speech at the influential business group’s 33rd biennial convention, but he did point to agreements reached during his state visit to China in January. The President said the Board of Investments is monitoring 90 active investment leads from Chinese companies engaged in manufacturing, information technology, business process management and renewable energy after his state visit. “May you all take hold of and maximize these prospects as you venture into your next endeavors for the benefit of our people and for our communities,” the Chief Executive told the group’s members. Marcos also thanked FFCCCII members for their role in nation-building since 1954, when the group was formed by longtime residents and immigrants from China and Taiwan after the Chinese Civil War ended in 1949. The group, which has members supporting either Beijing or Taiwan, has become one of the most influential business groups in the country. “We deeply appreciate your assistance in conducting medical missions and typhoon and earthquake relief operations,” the President told the group. “As you conduct your biennial convention today, may you reaffirm your commitment to support the government in accelerating the country’s development efforts,” he added. Marcos told the Chinese-Filipino businessmen that the government was already addressing the issues they raised during a meeting last September. He said the government has amended the implementing rules of the Renewable Energy Act, which removes foreign ownership restrictions for certain renewable energy projects in the Philippines.

    "article_body": "The price ceiling on milled rice, being implemented for the fourth week, may be “lifted soon” considering that it has so far helped bring down prices of the staple grain and would not be good to keep in force for a long time, according to the government’s top economist. Executive Order No. 39, signed on Aug. 31, pegs the price of a kilo of regular milled rice at a maximum of P41 and of well-milled rice at P45. Secretary Arsenio Balisacan of the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) said in an interview with ANC that EO 39 “is supposedly and is expected to be” only a short-term, temporary measure. “No long-term price control, when viewed in a long-term perspective, has worked anywhere,” Balisacan said. When asked when implementation of the price ceilings would end, Balisacan said “very soon.” ‘To protect consumers’ “Even the President is well aware of the dangers of a long and unnecessary price cap. He just has to be assured, to see the data, that the [needed policy] tools are used to protect the consumers, especially the vulnerable sectors,” he added. He added that even in socialist regimes in centrally controlled economies like China and Vietnam got rid of price controls. Even then, he said EO 39 was working as a temporary measure to address temporary issues in the domestic rice market. “When the inflation number for rice in the month of September comes out [next week], that number is expected to be lower than it would have without price caps,” Balisacan said. gsg",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has added a private sector representative to the Public-Private Partnership Governing Board (PPPGB) to boost private sector participation in PPP projects, including big-ticket projects of the administration. Under Executive Order (EO) No. 30 signed on June 1, the president said he wanted to strengthen the private sector’s participation in the PPP Center by appointing one representative from a reputable organization in the banking, business, and infrastructure sectors. Marcos said the private sector representative should “promptly notify” the PPPGB of any actual, perceived, or potential conflict of interest, which could affect the performance of his or her duties as a member of the governing board. The EO said the representative would take the place of the private sector co-chairperson under the National Competitive Council (NCC), who used to be one of the PPPGB members. But the NCC was reorganized and became the Ease of Doing Business and Anti-Red Tape Advisory Council under Republic Act No. 11032 in 2018. Under the new EO, the Socioeconomic Planning Secretary will serve as the PPPGB chair while the secretaries of finance, budget, justice, trade, and the executive secretary would serve as vice chairperson. The EO said the chairperson and three other board members would constitute a quorum and a majority vote of the members present would be needed for the adoption of any issuance, order, resolution and decision. 194 high-impact projects According to the EO, the PPPGB will be “responsible for setting the strategic direction of the PPP Program and creating an enabling policy and institutional environment for PPP.” The National Economic and Development Authority (Neda) Board, which is chaired by the President, approved in March 194 high-impact priority projects worth P9 trillion as part of the government’s “Build Better More” program. Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said 123 of the 194 infrastructure flagship projects (IFPs) were new, adding that the government would speed up their rollout by strongly promoting the use of the PPP scheme. He said 45 of the IFPs are expected to be financed through partnerships with the private sector. The PPP mode allows private financiers to finance government projects, such as hospitals, airports, tollways, and then allows them to collect fees from users during the duration of the contract.

But it still asked homeowners to save water, since the intense heat in several parts of the country may last until May or June.

It noted that “El Niño is causing lower-than-average rainfall.” The department advised residents to check for water leaks by looking at their meters early in the morning or late at night. READ: Metro Manila residents told to save water Water leaks can account for 15 percent to 40 percent of used water every month. The DENR said checking for leaks can help save 500 liters to 1,000 liters of water. Pool maintenance Condominium managers and village administrators were also urged to postpone pool maintenance which would require draining and replacing the water. “The WRMO (Water Resource Management Office of the DENR) prohibits households to use water [hoses] for car washing, cleaning of driveways and watering of lawns and to instead use a pail and dipper, or ‘tabo,’” the DENR also said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) has asked the Bureau of Customs to release P178.5 million worth of confiscated frozen mackerel to the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) to aid in relief efforts. Laboratory tests conducted by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources’ (BFAR) National Fisheries Laboratory Division showed that the frozen fish is fit for human consumption since it has no signs of spoilage or contamination, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said in his Nov. 18 letter to Customs Commissioner Bienvenido Rubio. READ: DSWD: Successive typhoons straining gov’t relief funds “Consequently, the fish products are deemed fit for immediate release and can be utilized to address food security needs, especially in relief operations,” Tiu Laurel said in a statement over the weekend. The DA said the frozen mackerel amounted to 580 metric tons (MT) that were loaded in 21 container vans that arrived in early October from China. READ: DA eyes importation of fish, vegetables But the importer, Pacific Sealand Foods Corp., did not have the required sanitary and phytosanitary import clearances. Import clearances ensure that imported food items comply with standards, protecting the health of Filipino consumers, plants, and animals while preventing the spread of diseases or pests. The DA subsequently directed the BFAR to conduct laboratory tests to determine whether or not the seized frozen mackerel can be distributed to typhoon-hit areas. “This initiative would support the DSWD and the Department of Agriculture’s ongoing efforts to provide essential aid to victims of the recent typhoon,” Tiu Laurel said. The DA had said it was considering importing an additional 8,000 MT of small pelagic fish, including round scad, mackerel, moonfish, and bonito, that could arrive in the first two weeks of December. This was on top of the importation of 30,000 MT of fish authorized by Tiu Laurel in April to plug the supply gap during the temporary fishing ban implemented annually for three months to protect target fish species during their peak spawning period and address other concerns, such as overfishing and climate change. Although the DA did not say there is a supply shortage, the planned importation is meant to address any potential problems caused by the onslaught of successive typhoons and prevent any possible price spikes.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa is considering making “modern methods of contraception” accessible to younger age groups to prevent unwanted pregnancies that could compromise the health of the mother and the unborn child. In a Palace briefing following a sectoral meeting with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday, Herbosa explained that teenage expectant mothers are more likely to neglect their pregnancies because these are often unplanned. READ: Pass teen pregnancy prevention bill now, PH government urged Women who plan their pregnancies, on the other hand, are more likely to be proactive about their own and their child’s health. “For the childhood pregnancy, my thinking is if I am able to make modern methods of contraception available, I can half that; I can half the mortalities due to childhood pregnancies,” Herbosa said. “If the pregnancy is planned, proper nutrition will surely be ensured, right? Prenatal checkups will be done, and the diet will be monitored. But it’s the unplanned pregnancy that gives us the low birth weight, small-for-gestational age, or low birth weight. These babies are born underweight right from birth,” he also said. He cited implantable kinds of contraception as something that can be made available to adolescents. “We already have the Reproductive Health Law. I just have to make it available in clinics and probably for people to ask for it. We are having a problem here because it seems like some parents and some sectors want parental consent for minors to get access to these reproductive health products,” Herbosa explained when asked whether he will push for the institutionalization of a program that will make contraceptives available to adolescents. “Huwag na tayong maglokohan, because they have sex anyway, so hindi ko naman sila mahinto to have sex, right? So, probably give them protection for safe sex that will not go unplanned,” he added. (Let’s not kid ourselves—they’re going to have sex anyway, and I can’t stop them from doing so, right? So it’s probably better to provide them with protection to ensure safe sex and prevent unplanned pregnancies.) According to the Commission on Population and Development, a total of 3,135 girls younger than 15 years old gave birth in 2022. This was a 35.13 percent increase from the 2,320 recorded in 2021. READ: Popcom ‘deeply concerned’ about rise in teen pregnancies With that, population and development advocates called for the urgent passage of the Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention Bill to curb rising teenage pregnancies. The United Nations Population Fund, Commission on Population and Development, and Philippine Legislators’ Committee on Population and Development made their appeal on World Population Day 2024, emphasizing that the proposed measure would empower social justice and provide comprehensive action to address adolescent pregnancy in the country.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Thursday dismissed the petition questioning the 2025 national budget before the Supreme Court as part of alleged efforts to destabilize his administration. Although saying he was confident that the government has a strong case to counter the petition for certiorari and prohibition against the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA), Mr. Marcos warned that there was no Plan B if the Supreme Court strikes it down as unconstitutional. “No. We shut down everything. I guess that’s what they want. They want the government to cease working so that they can continue the destabilization that they are doing,” the President noted. In an interview at Mactan-Cebu International Airport on Thursday afternoon, a visibly irked Mr. Marcos maintained that the government was on “solid footing” amid questions over the GAA’s legality. He said Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra gave him this assurance and that he would let the state lawyer argue the government’s case before the high court. “I don’t know why they bothered to file that because they made a difficult assertion. Anyway, it’s not for me to make the argument. We’re very confident that our case is strong,” Mr. Marcos added. The remarks came a few days after Vic Rodriguez, Mr. Marcos’ former executive secretary, and Davao City Rep. Isidro Ungab filed a petition questioning the constitutionality of the 2025 national budget. They alleged that the bicameral conference committee report that led to the GAA had “blank spaces” when it was signed by the committee’s members before Congress ratified the GAA bill. The petitioners urged the high court to strike down the 2025 national budget as unconstitutional and called it an “illegal and criminal” measure. Earlier this week, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, one of the respondents in the petition, said it was “too soon” for him to comment since he has yet to receive the complaint or see its contents. Not allowed by law On Thursday morning, the President also told the 20th National Convention of Lawyers in Cebu City that he could not find the “damned blank items” when he reviewed 4,057 pages of the GAA before signing it into law. He told lawyers that he could give them a run for their money when it came to going over voluminous documents and contracts. “Just last month, I had to read 4,057 pages of the GAA for 2025. Because I reviewed it, analyzed it, and yes—in parts vetoed it,” Mr. Marcos said. He went on, “Up to now, I cannot find those damned blank items. We’ll keep looking; we’ll keep looking. But I’m convinced that they simply do not exist because [they are] not allowed to exist.” Last week, Mr. Marcos called his predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, a liar for claiming that there were blank spaces in the 2025 national budget that were to be filled up later. Mr. Marcos said Duterte, as a former Chief Executive himself, should know “perfectly well that it doesn’t ever happen”—referring to the blank spaces in the GAA. Duterte, who counts Ungab as an ally, warned that the GAA would be an “invalid legislation” if Congress passed it with some items left blank.",

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. has issued an executive order to hasten the issuance of permits for offshore wind (OSW) power projects as the government eyes boosting the use of renewable energy in the country. Under Executive Order (EO) No. 21, the President said Republic Act No. 9513, or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008, said the government should accelerate the exploration and development of renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, hydropower, geothermal, and ocean. Mr. Marcos said the Philippine Offshore Wind Roadmap has identified a total technical potential capacity of 178 gigawatts that could be harnessed from OSW resources. “OSW, if optimally developed, will play a major role in our country’s goal for a low-carbon future, improved energy security, and reduced dependence on import fuels,” the EO read. The EO would streamline and expedite the approval process by the permitting agencies for the issuance of permits, licenses, and clearances for OSW projects and “eliminate unnecessary delays in every stage of an OSW project.” The EO defined permitting agencies as government agencies or relevant entities that are concessionaires or franchisees of the government which permitting process or authority is relevant. The President said that within 60 days from the issuance of the EO, the Department of Energy (DOE) should formulate and issue a policy and administrative framework “for the efficient and optimal development of the country’s OSW resources, which shall be made applicable to all permitting agencies.” Produce cheap electricity The order stated that 60 days from the effectivity of the EO, pertinent agencies should submit to the DOE a complete list of required permits, including fees and procedures. The Department of the Interior and Local Government should also submit to the DOE a complete list of appropriate permits required by local government units. The EO directed all pertinent agencies to review their existing fees and charges and update them in accordance with applicable laws, rules, and regulations to support and encourage the development of OSW projects. The EO ordered the DOE for the full integration of applicable permits into the Energy Virtual One-Stop Shop. Last year, Mr. Marcos said the Philippines had the potential to be a “major wind power producer” in the world. “We have the potential to be a major wind power producer in the world. Our unique topography is very suitable for building offshore wind farms, and we should take advantage of it to produce cheap electricity,” he said.

    "article_body": "New innovations could eventually help the Philippines transition to a more “sustainable sachet economy,” scientists said on Thursday, as they allayed concerns that the country’s plastic sachet culture was nothing but inevitable. During a forum on microplastics hosted by the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), scientists Deo Florence Onda and Rey Capangpangan said the use of sachets—small pouches made of single-use plastics—could actually be maintained, but should be replaced with more biodegradable materials. Onda and Capangpangan presented separate but concurring research into microplastics, or microscopic degraded plastic debris, in the Philippines’ marine ecosystems. Both found that microplastics were now being ingested by marine life like shellfish and pelagic fish (those that live in water columns). This was symptomatic of the country’s larger problem with plastic pollution, to which the Philippines contributes about 0.75 million metric tons to the ocean every year, said Science Secretary Renato Solidum Jr. In particular, Onda’s team, which began building a database on the macro—and microplastics found in coastal and marine environments, found that sachets were among the top culprits of plastic pollution in the Philippines. “The use of sachets [caters] to a certain socioeconomic problem,” said Onda, who is also deputy director for research at the University of the Philippines’ Marine Science Institute. “However, science can help assist the transition to a more sustainable type of sachet.” The DOST already has several studies on possible green alternatives to plastics, such as seaweed or hemp (abaca), Onda noted. By exploring these alternatives, “you’re not only replacing the material, but you’re also helping sustain the economy, because you’re helping create [livelihood] for the farmers of these materials.” Ultimately, this can even help the Philippines’ shift to a more circular economy, where waste is reduced to a minimum through repurposing or creating more sustainable value chains, Capangpangan said. He said Filipino scientists could even explore the “atom economy,” or pollution prevention at a molecular level by replacing components of the material. “We can always make modifications through the proper choice of raw materials,” he added. While the country’s scientists work on possible alternatives, the national government is beefing up efforts to first address public behavior toward plastics while working on big structural changes to address plastic pollution. Assistant Environment Secretary Daniel Nicer said the Department of Environment and Natural Resources was set to release the implementing rules and regulations for the newly passed Extended Producer Responsibility law, which requires large companies to keep a large percentage of their wastes away from landfills.

The OWWA board allocated P15 million for the initial implementation. The OWWA said the OFW Children’s Circle will host activities to showcase the children’s creative skills and talents and improve their socialization skills and coping mechanisms. The new program will also promote civic advocacies among the children, values reorientation, digital literacy and awareness against drug abuse; build camaraderie; and develop potential leaders. The program will be piloted by OWWA regional welfare offices in five out of the 17 regions, namely Metro Manila, Ilocos, Calabarzon, Central Visayas and Southern Mindanao.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Thousands of four-wheel tractors purchased last year by the previous management of the Philippine Center for Postharvest Development and Mechanization (PHilMech) have been found to be “overpriced.” The PHilMech, an attached agency of the Department of Agriculture (DA), has uncovered irregularities in the procurement of 1,346 units of four-wheel farm tractors, which were purchased for P1.298 million each or a total of P1.75 billion. However, the new management of PHilMech discovered the price for each four-wheel farm tractor should have not exceeded P1.2 million. This means that PHilMech paid an additional P98,000 for each tractor or a total of P131 million more to acquire 1,346 units of the four-wheel tractors under the Rice Competitiveness Enhancement Fund (RCEF)-Mechanization Program fund for 2021. Probe underway PHilMech has already informed the Department of Budget and Management of the alleged irregularities and has sought the legal advice of the Commission on Audit and the DA. Separately, PHilMech told the Inquirer in an email that a probe is underway. “Because of the agency’s findings, PHilMech will not pay the contractors as we uncovered an overprice for each four-wheel farm tractor,” said Dionisio Alvindia, executive director of PHilMech. The alleged irregularities were discovered after Alvindia assumed office in March this year. Amid the acquisition irregularities, PHilMech assured that the distribution of farm equipment under the RCEF Mechanization Program and the support for programs including the Coconut Farmers and Industry Development Plan would continue. P5-B annual budget PHilMech is allotted P5 billion annually for six years to acquire and distribute farm machinery and equipment to eligible farmers cooperatives and associations for free. The fund is taken from the RCEF, or the rice fund, which has an annual budget of P10 billion also for six years. Such provisions are spelled out in the Rice Tariffication Law, which aims to improve the competitiveness and income of rice farmers amid the liberalization of the rice market. PHilMech, meanwhile, has started setting up the Agricultural Machinery Design and Prototyping Center in its headquarters in Muñoz, Nueva Ecija, in collaboration with the Korea International Cooperation Agency, Korea Institute for Development Strategy and the Korea Agricultural Machinery Cooperative. “We also assure that PHilMech will continue to be at the forefront of developing and commercializing farm technologies that will significantly help farmers and the disadvantaged groups in the country’s agriculture sector to cope with the challenges of globalized markets and climate change, among others,” Alvindia said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Environmental and social impacts of the controversial dolomite placement for the Manila Bay Rehabilitation Program will be explored amid concerns by several sectors surrounding the project that were raised since the previous administration, Environment Secretary Ma. Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said on Friday. This developed as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) announced the completion of the placement of dolomite over Manila Bay ranging 500 meters from the US Embassy toward Remedios Street in Manila. Yulo-Loyzaga made the assurance to ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro who asked for updates on the five-year rehabilitation program of Manila Bay during the deliberations for the DENR’s budget for 2023 at the House of Representatives. Castro pointed out that the rehabilitation program for Manila Bay was divided into three phases, although no one from the DENR mentioned what phase the project was already under the Marcos administration. The progressive lawmaker also stressed the impacts caused by the dolomite placement, which was initially blamed for the flooding in some streets of Manila last month. The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority later clarified that the ongoing constructions of three pumping stations were the cause of the flooding. READ: Dolomite project just one of many ecological threats seen in Manila Bay In response to Castro’s interpellation, Yulo-Loyzaga assured her that the DENR was “looking very closely” at the environmental and social impacts brought by the Manila Bay’s rehabilitation involving the placing of dolomite sand. “We will continue to evaluate it ... using our scientific evaluation, as well as the social vulnerability evaluation that we intend to implement,” Yulo-Loyzaga said. Jonas Leones, the DENR undersecretary for policy, planning and international affairs, said the agency had already completed the placement for the dolomite beach, with its width ranging from 30 m to 140 m “from seawall to seawards.” Leones said at the budget hearing that the DENR would also move for the rehabilitation of water interceptors, so that the wastewater to be discharged into Manila Bay would be clean and be “treated” first.

    "article_body": "Tourism Secretary Christina Garcia Frasco will be taking a break from her duties to “spend time with her young family” following fallout over the Department of Tourism’s (DOT) use of stock footage from other countries in a promotional video. The tourism chief’s vacation is from July 13 to July 21, according to the DOT’s Office of Public Affairs and Advocacy. “The purpose of the short leave, consisting of only seven working days, is to spend time with her young family,” the office told reporters on Tuesday. The department insisted that Frasco’s leave had nothing to do with the controversy over the DOT’s promotional video for its new “Love the Philippines” campaign that had used clips of tourist spots in Thailand, Indonesia, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. “Any insinuation to the contrary is false,” the DOT said. On July 2, the advertising agency DDB Group Philippines accepted blame for the video blunder that had grabbed international headlines, apologizing to the DOT and the public. But the tourism department announced the next day that it was terminating its P49-million contract with the firm. Some news outfits reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources, that Frasco was going abroad with her family, including her husband, Cebu Rep. Duke Frasco, but neither Frasco nor the DOT confirmed this. The Inquirer reached out to Frasco to ask for details about her leave but there was no reply at press time. Leave filed in May The department told reporters that Frasco submitted her leave request to the Office of the President as early as May 9, ahead of the launch of the new campaign. Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Velicaria Garafil on Tuesday confirmed that Frasco filed her leave of absence on that day. Garafil said the Office of the President approved her leave on May 23. Frasco is expected to report back to work in time for President Marcos’ second State of the Nation Address on July 24. Reached for comment, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III said Frasco’s decision to go on leave should not affect any investigation that Congress may conduct on the DOT tourism campaign mess. “DOT has undersecretaries who can represent the department in the hearings, especially the officer in charge during her leave,” Pimentel told the Inquirer. Frasco still has President’s trust The President has said he continues to trust Frasco despite the promo debacle. In three public events this month, the DOT chief, a daughter of Cebu Gov. Gwen Garcia, had dodged questions from reporters about the fiasco. On July 5, on the sidelines of the 2022 Philippine Tourism Satellite Accounts and Tourism Statistics Dissemination Forum, Frasco briefly told reporters, “I think that is evident,” when asked if the DOT would be keeping the new tourism slogan. Albay Rep. Joey Salceda, who has criticized the tourism campaign for not including Albay’s Mayon Volcano in the promotional video, declined to comment on Frasco’s leave. He earlier said he would not ask for her resignation as she appeared open to recommendations about the tourism campaign. —WITH A REPORT FROM NESTOR CORRALES INQ",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Some P150 million has been set aside in this year’s budget to set up new medical schools in state universities and colleges (SUCs) around the country, bringing to P1 billion the cumulative seed money for the purpose. In a statement on Sunday, Quezon City Rep. Marvin Rillo, vice chairperson of the House of Representatives’ committee on higher and technical education, said, “In the 2025 General Appropriations Law, Congress has added P150 million to the seed fund for the development of new colleges of medicine in SUCs.” Rillo, who is also a member of the House panel on appropriations, pointed out that the P150 million is on top of a total of P925 million allocated for the SUC medical school seed fund since 2021. READ: Lawmaker to gov’t: Make med schools affordable When Congress first set up the startup fund in 2021, an initial P150 million was set aside in the national budget. Both for 2022 and for 2023, P250 million was allocated for the fund while P275 million was set aside last year. “The seed money will support the new schools of medicine in our SUCs, helping them develop their capacity to provide instruction, acquire teaching materials, upgrade libraries, and build advanced laboratory facilities,” the lawmaker said. He noted that the 19th Congress has, so far, passed five draft measures creating new colleges of medicine in the Benguet State University in La Trinidad, Benguet; the Southern Luzon State University in Lucban, Quezon; the University of Eastern Philippines in Catarman, Northern Samar; the Visayas State University in Baybay City, Leyte; and at the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University in Agoo, La Union. More physicians needed “Congress is committed to fully developing our new schools of medicine in SUCs to enable the country to train and produce more physicians,” Rillo said. “We need more physicians to meet the growing demand of Filipinos for improved health outcomes.” Last week, House Minority Leader Marcelino Libanan urged President Marcos to certify as urgent nine draft laws creating medical schools in SUCs to produce more doctors and strengthen the country’s healthcare system. Congress is set to take a break for the elections starting Feb. 8. The 4Ps representative cited Department of Health data showing the country’s doctor-to-population ratio at around 3.6 doctors for every 10,000 people, where the ideal ratio, according to the World Health Organization, was 10 doctors for every 10,000 people, or one doctor for every 1,000 people. Libanan said, “Right now, we are not producing enough new doctors due to the prohibitive cost of medical schooling in private higher education institutions. This is why we need more colleges of medicine in our SUCs, especially in the provinces.” Libanan authored one of the nine bills seeking to establish new medical schools in SUCs, including the Eastern Samar State University in Borongan City; the Polytechnic University of the Philippines in Quezon City; the University of Science and Technology of Southern Philippines in Cagayan de Oro City; Samar State University in Catbalogan City; Aklan State University in Ibajay, Aklan; Mindanao State University in General Santos City; North Eastern Mindanao State University in Tandag, Surigao del Sur; Bukidnon State University in Malaybalay City; and Sultan Kudarat State University in Tacurong City.",

    "article_body": "BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, Brunei—President Marcos admitted on Wednesday that he was aware of the plan to unseat Juan Miguel “Migz” Zubiri as Senate President but maintained that he had nothing to do with it. Speaking to reporters covering his state visit to the Bruneian capital, the President said Sen. Francis “Chiz” Escudero brought up the plan with him, adding he was informed “every step of the way.” “Actually, it was Senator Chiz. At the minute he started thinking about it, he already brought it up and said: ‘I think I am going to try to be the SP. What is my situation? What do you think?’ ” Marcos said, quoting Escudero. When Zubiri resigned as Senate President on May 20, he said his refusal to “follow instructions from the powers that be” cost him the third highest government office. Out of town Escudero, who received the vote of 14 other senators to replace Zubiri, initially claimed he had no prior knowledge of the move to oust his colleague. But he admitted a day after his election that he had instigated it and that some senators already had reservations about Zubiri’s leadership. Mr. Marcos also admitted that “there were movements” to oust Zubiri but that “I did not speak to any parties (behind the moves) because I was out of town” on the day Escudero took over. Mr. Marcos was then in Tacloban City and Dumaguete City to lead aid distribution in areas reeling from the El Niño dry spell. “The decision to change the leadership was not made by me. It was made by the senators,” the President stressed, recalling that by the time he got back to Manila around 4 p.m. on May 20, Zubiri had already stepped down. But he said he knew about “the state of voting” when the votes “were still being collected” by Escudero. “We already knew the number that would come out. So that’s the extent. I was basically informed at every step of the way, but it moved so quickly as well.” ‘Unclear to me’ In his farewell speech as Senate President, an emotional Zubiri said he had “ruffled some feathers” by not following orders from the powers that be and that this probably led to his “demise.” Told of this remark, Mr. Marcos said he was unsure what Zubiri was referring to. “I guess if you are Senate President, the only ‘power that be’ is the President. So, I am not sure what he is referring to. If that is a specific instance or just as a general principle. I don’t know, I have not spoken to him about it,’’ he said. “So, it is hard for me to answer simply because I am not sure what he is referring to because what ‘instructions’ could that be that he did not finish. Yes, that’s still unclear to me what he’s referring to,” he added. He said Zubiri still had his trust and confidence and that the change in the Senate leadership, being decided by its members, “does not reflect on my view” of the senator.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The newly established OFW (overseas Filipino worker) Hospital in San Fernando City, Pampanga, may be living up to its name — but not in the way it was intended to. Its prospective nurses are leaving for higher paying jobs overseas, according to the hospital head, Dr. Jose Dante Dator. “The biggest challenge is hiring nurses. Everybody is aware that when we hire nurses locally, we don’t have as much response,” Dator said in a Senate briefing he gave on Wednesday on the proposed budget of the newly created Department of Migrant Workers (DMW). “Just last week we hired six nurses. Only two came to the hospital; two were already going abroad,” he reported. Created under Executive Order No. 154 issued by then President Rodrigo Duterte, the OFW Hospital has been in operation since May. Aiming for ‘level 2’ Aside from functioning as a regular medical facility for migrant workers and their dependents, it is also intended to train health-care workers and serve as a research facility for work-related illnesses that OFWs contract abroad. Dator said the hospital remained at a “low utilization rate” as it had attended so far only to outpatient cases. He stressed this point to highlight the need for more funding as the hospital was allotted only P13 million in the 2023 National Expenditure Program, out of the P500-million budget it requested. Speaking with reporters after the briefing, Migrant Workers Secretary Susan Ople appealed to Congress to augment the P13 million earmarked to the OFW Hospital to fill the “huge” fund gap. “The OFW Hospital aims to cater to 1,000 patients a month. They will be admitting patients soon,” Ople said, adding that the facility targets a 102-bed capacity and a “level 2” status. A level 2 hospital is capable of providing “definitive care for all injured patients,” with 24-hour general surgery services, and can handle cases involving orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, anesthesiology, emergency medicine, radiology and critical care, according to the Department of Health (DOH) website. Deployment cap? Ople said the Marcos administration had begun discussing the possibility of imposing a deployment cap on certain occupations amid the current shortage of professionals in the country. An interagency meeting was conducted among the DMW, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Labor and Employment, and the Commission on Higher Education to come up with a “sustainability program” to stem the country’s “brain drain,” she said. “We are aware that we cannot prevent workers from leaving and it will be unjust to make them stay here because they have long been waiting for circumstances to change in the domestic workforce. We are already looking at some measures by which we can make our (skilled workers) stay,” Ople said. First-ever budget For its first year of operation, the DMW is seeking a budget of P15.2 billion, of which the bulk amounting to P11.7 billion will be earmarked to the Overseas Workers Welfare Administration, an attached agency of the department that provides direct services and assistance to OFWs, Ople said. It was also asking for P50.5 million to set up 17 regional offices, she added.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — One of the staunchest allies of Vice President Sara Duterte described her impeachment on Wednesday as a process “railroaded” by the House of Representatives, but expressed confidence she would be able to face the Senate trial with her head held up high. Salvador Panelo, chief legal counsel during the Duterte administration, said the Vice President’s lawyers, whom he did not name, are “ready for an impeachment trial.” “She will face the impeachment—smilingly, courageously, and competently,” Panelo told the Inquirer in a Viber message. https://youtu.be/-DUk6-_rcG4 READ: Duterte’s impeachment an initial victory vs corruption — petitioners Duterte herself has yet to issue a statement on her impeachment at press time. “As I have repeatedly stated, the purpose is to destroy and besmirch the reputation of VP Sara with the ultimate goal of disqualifying her from the 2028 presidential elections, being the leading contender,” said Panelo, who touted himself as being Duterte’s longtime defender since her years as Davao City mayor. ‘Voice of the people’ He also criticized the House members, most of whom had allied themselves with Sara’s father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, during his term, for not heeding the “overwhelming voice of the people” opposing the Vice President’s impeachment. Panelo was apparently referring to the Jan. 13 “Rally for Peace” held nationwide by the influential sect Iglesia Ni Cristo (INC). He said the lawmakers’ decision also contradicted the stated position of President Marcos against pursuing “such a divisive and nonproductive political endeavor that does not benefit a single Filipino.” “Their move will only galvanize the support of the Filipino people on VP Sara, and will fan the flames of disgust and rage against their willful and brazen violation of the guarantees enshrined in the Constitution,” Panelo said. House ‘cunning’ Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa, one of Duterte’s allies in the Senate, accused the House of deception for impeaching the Vice President on the last day of the regular session of the 19th Congress before it takes a break for the midterm elections in May. Dela Rosa, who is seeking reelection, also noted that the House decided to transmit the articles of impeachment to the Senate just a few days before the official campaign period starts on Feb. 11. “They are cunning. They will take us hostage as we sit as judges of the (Senate) impeachment court while they hit the campaign trail,” Dela Rosa told reporters. “I have been expecting this to happen. I saw their efforts to impeach the Vice President,” he said. According to Dela Rosa, he and several of his colleagues agreed that the Senate may have to wait until the resumption of their regular session in June before they convene as judges of the impeachment court. Up to voters The senator said he would leave his fate to the voters as he acknowledged that the development may affect his chances of winning a second term. Despite his close relations with the Vice President and her father, he insisted that he would be an impartial senator-judge. “It’s up to you how you perceive me. But I will still maintain my political neutrality. Just wait for my vote,” Dela Rosa said. “I’m not denying that I’m close with the President and I’m identified with the Dutertes, but my decision will be made once I have studied the articles of impeachment and (after) the prosecution (team) has presented their case,” he said. “I will be apolitical.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Several senators have expressed their frustration over the continued failure of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) to lower the out-of-pocket medical expenses of Filipinos nearly five years after the enactment of the Universal Health Care (UHC) Act. At the Senate plenary hearing on the agency’s proposed budget of P68.7 billion for 2025 on Tuesday night, Sen. JV Ejercito pointed out that PhilHealth and the Department of Health had been mandated to implement the landmark measure intended to provide free medical services for all patients within a 10-year period. Ejercito, the primary author and sponsor of the UHC Act lamented that since its passage in 2019, the law has “hardly made a dent,” as PhilHealth had been ineffective in offering benefit packages, particularly for the most vulnerable sectors such as indigents and senior citizens. READ: PhilHealth chief on P89B excess funds: Wrong to pin the blame on me READ: Sen. Padilla denies cursing PhilHealth chief at Senate session hall The state health insurer, he noted, has practically become a private company as it reported profits in the past several years, including the P89.9 billion in excess funds that Finance Secretary Ralph Recto had ordered to be remitted to the national treasury. “You should not be proud that you have savings. [You] are not a private corporation,” Ejercito told PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. “How come you had almost [P90] billion in excess funds when, in fact, I know that most of us here experience that a lot of our constituents are still lining up, having a hard time paying for their hospital bills?” he asked. Responding to Ejercito’s queries, Ledesma defended himself, saying he had actually implemented reforms in PhilHealth’s case rates system in his first two years in office. “I entered [PhilHealth] in November 2022. Two months after, we adjusted the case rates and that’s the first time it happened in 12 years. Maybe you can give me some slack,” Ledesma told the senator. “I think it’s wrong to pin the blame fully on me,” he added. Leadership issue To which Ejercito retorted, “Who should we blame? Isn’t this a leadership [issue]?” Ledesma’s demeanor during Ejercito’s interpellation did not sit well with several senators, prompting Senate Majority Leader Francis Tolentino to remind the PhilHealth chief to respect the chamber and its members. According to Ejercito, ordinary Filipinos had to contend not only with food inflation but also with “medical inflation,” as the cost of hospitalization has steadily increased over the years. “We are comfortable in our offices, but a lot of people are struggling to pay their hospital bills and that’s the reality,” he said. Ejercito then presented actual hospital billings to back up claims that PhilHealth had provided scant financial coverage even to paying members. One of the documents showed that the state health insurer paid only P15,120 out of the patient’s total bill of almost P1.5 million, or a measly 1 percent of the hospital fee. “It frustrates me because by now, entering the fifth year of implementation of the [UHC], the law should already be felt by the people,” the senator said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The World Economic Forum (WEF) is a great venue for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to present the Maharlika Investment Fund (MIF) to see the reception of other countries to the proposed sovereign wealth fund, a Filipino-Canadian economist said on Monday. “The president can gauge the interest of other countries, how it [will be] received by the audience when the President presents the MIF,” Dr. Michael Batu said in the televised Laging Handa public briefing. Prior to his departure to Davos, Switzerland, to participate in the WEF meeting, Marcos had said he would discuss the proposed sovereign wealth fund of the Philippines with world leaders attending the WEF. Batu said the president should mention possible areas of MIF’s “directed investments” such as agriculture, digitalization, energy and climate resiliency, so that he could discuss them with WEF participants, get some advice, and also learn the best practices in running sovereign wealth funds. “This will help in improving and refining the current version of the [proposed legislation on the] sovereign wealth fund, while it heads to the Senate this month,” added Batu, an assistant professor of economics at the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford, British Columbia. House Bill No. 6608, or the MIF Act, was approved on the third and final reading by the House of Representatives on Dec. 15. The measure was transmitted to the Senate four days later. Under the bill, the MIF will be an independent fund that would adhere to the principles of good governance, transparency, and accountability. It would be sourced from the investible funds of select government financial institutions (GFIs), contributions of the national government, the declared dividends of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, and other sources. Strategic investments The fund will be used to invest on a strategic and commercial basis in a manner designed to promote fiscal stability for economic development and strengthen the top-performing GFIs through additional investment platforms that will help attain the national government’s priority plans. Sen. Risa Hontiveros, however, said on Monday that President Marcos would just make himself “look amateur” should he pursue his plan to pitch the MIF at the Davos forum. “The bill establishing [MIF] has not yet been deliberated at the Senate. Isn’t it jumping the gun to be talking about it in front of world economic leaders?” Hontiveros said in a statement. “The discussions will be frivolous and the concept is full of fissures. The president will just look amateur,” she warned. Echoing the view of Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III, she said it would be premature to have a “soft launch” of the MIF at the conference. “There is nothing to present,” the opposition lawmaker reiterated. “Indeed, it makes sense to talk to an international audience about a domestically-oriented sovereign development fund if there is already a portfolio of attractive projects that have been assembled. But we don’t have that yet,” she pointed out.

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. led the inauguration and energization of the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines’ (NGCP) 500-kilovolt transmission line that can deliver 8,000 megawatts of electricity from power plants in Bataan and Zambales. “This transmission project attests to the transformative power of collaboration between the public and the private sectors to be able to attain a stable, reliable, and resilient power supply for the country,” he said. Mr. Marcos added: “It will also help in the administration’s thrust to transition to renewable energy to mitigate the impact of geopolitical uncertainties and of course, the effects of climate change.” READ: Marcos urges NGCP to complete energy projects on time The Chief Executive also ordered the Department of Energy (DOE) and NGCP to finish 70 other transmission line projects in the pipeline. “I direct the DOE and the NGCP to complete the almost 70 transmission projects on time ... particularly the Batangas-Mindoro Interconnection Project and the Northern Luzon 230-kiloVolt Loop,” he said. The transmission line took seven years to complete at an approved cost of P20.94 billion, but it will also connect with other projects, such as the Battery Energy Storage System in Limay and the Bataan-Cavite Interlink Bridge. It will also serve as a vital corridor for the 5,080 MW and the additional 2,554 MW of committed power generation projects in Bataan and Zambales. The project involves over 275.6 circuit kilometers of overhead lines supported by nearly 395 towers and two new substations. Powering 59M homes Anthony Almeda, president of NGCP, assured power consumers in the Luzon grid of a “secure and stabilized” line that can handle power from more generation plans. “This critical backbone provides a new high-voltage link capable of transmitting a total of 8,000 MW of power from power plants in Bataan and Zambales,” Almeda said. “The line is ready to serve and benefit the 59 million households and other power consumers in Luzon,” he added. However, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority, the total number of households in the entire country reached only 26 million and may increase by around three million in next year’s national survey. Nonetheless, the NGCP assured consumers that the energization of the new line should preclude power outages similar to those in February on Panay Island and in Southern Luzon last April. Cynthia Alabanza, spokesperson for the NGCP, said that as long as power plants do not trip, the grid operator has a boosted network of transmission lines to deliver electricity, which can avoid widespread outages.

    "article_body": "CEBU CITY—For someone who had punched a court sheriff for carrying out a court order, Vice President Sara Duterte now wants judges to be at the forefront in the fight against “summary executions and dangerous urge of street justice” by rendering speedy justice. “As trial judges, you have the power to become the catalyst of change by ensuring that cases are presided over in a timely and impartial manner,” she said in a speech to over 300 judges from around the country who were attending the national convention of judges and commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Philippine Trial Judges League Inc. in Cebu City on Thursday. “You are instruments in restoring people’s faith in the system and to prevent the tragic consequences that derive from the lack of speedy justice,” said Duterte, a lawyer. She urged the judges to make sure that justice was served swiftly. “Your unwavering commitment to the pursuit of justice and the rule of law has been a beacon of hope for all Filipino people,” she said. READ: VP Sara Duterte: Secret funds’ critics ‘enemies of the people’ “It is imperative that we reflect upon the challenges that lie ahead and one such challenge that we must confront is the failure of speedy administration of justice,” she added. Dangerous precedent In her speech, the Vice President said that failing to render quick justice would set a dangerous precedent that could lead to the breakdown of justice.People’s disappointment and desperation, she said, might lead some individuals to resort to violence in order to take revenge. “We live in a society where the demand for justice is urgent and palpable,” Duterte said. She added: “It is our duty to rise to this challenge and address it. We must strive to ensure that justice is not only served but is served swiftly. We must work together to expedite the resolution of cases and restore faith in our justice system.” Davao incident When she was mayor of Davao City in 2011, Duterte punched a court sheriff, Abe Andres, multiple times for insisting on demolishing houses inside a contested property in Barangay Soliman of Davao’s Agdao district. Duterte explained that she was angered by Andres’ insistence on serving the notice of eviction when she was only asking for a two-hour reprieve until the residents’ lawyers got a ruling on the eviction case from the Court of Appeals. Andres was first hit in the left eye and was explaining to Duterte that he was just implementing a court order when the then mayor threw more punches that landed on his face. Duterte’s father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, is facing charges of committing crimes against humanity in the International Criminal Court in connection with the thousands believed to have been victims of extrajudicial killings in his war on drugs. Her father, a former city prosecutor, refuses to recognize the tribunal’s jurisdiction and says he will not cooperate with its investigation. After her speech to the judges, Duterte, the concurrent education secretary, spoke to more than 500 public school officials during the National Literacy Conference 2023 at the Department of Education Ecotech Center in Cebu City’s Barangay Lahug. She stressed the importance of educational literacy to empower people who could contribute to the stability and security of the country. INQ",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Monday condemned the “fake video” showing President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. allegedly using illegal drugs, saying it would pursue necessary actions to identify and prosecute those behind the material. “The timing of the release of this fake video, occurring just before the President’s State of the Nation Address (Sona), unmistakably indicates an intent to undermine the credibility of the President and the critical speech he is set to deliver,” it said in a statement. At a hastily called press conference at Camp Crame ahead of the Sona, Interior Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. ordered the Philippine National Police to form a task force to investigate the matter. Different features “I’ve known him for a long time and definitely those features aren’t his,” Abalos told reporters, referring to the man in the video. “This is too malicious ... It’s so unfair to the President because he will deliver his Sona today and this came out.” The video, which was reportedly played during an anti-Marcos government rally in the United States has since gone viral on social media. Abalos ordered the PNP to coordinate with the Department of Information and Communications Technology to investigate. In an ambush interview at the Batasang Pambansa, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin said the footage was “clearly meant” to defame the President. “[The guy in the video] looked like a Korean; that’s clearly not him,” Bersamin added. Former President Rodrigo Duterte on Monday denied having a hand in the release of the video that his supporters claimed showed Marcos using drugs. In a statement, Duterte doubled down on his allegation the President was a drug user, an allegation he made in January, adding that denial was the “weakest form of defense.” “With due apologies to all the experts who vouched for the authenticity of the video, the refusal of President Marcos to undergo the hair follicle drug test is the best proof not only of the video’s authenticity but, worse, his drug addiction,” he said. —with reports from Dempsey Reyes and Melvin Gascon",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — After two years, healthcare workers in some public hospitals finally received their long overdue health emergency allowance (HEA) for serving at the front lines at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, those in private and local government hospitals are still waiting for their turn. According to the Alliance of Health Workers (AHW), health personnel in government-owned and — controlled corporations' specialty hospitals — specifically the Lung Center of the Philippines, National Kidney and Transplant Institute, Philippine Heart Center, and Philippine Children’s Medical Center—received their HEA payments covering the period of January to September 2023 on March 13. Those at the Philippine General Hospital got the incentive earlier on Feb. 22, while health workers in hospitals retained by the Department of Health (DOH) received their allowances in the second week of February. Long way to go for frontliners The AHW attributed the positive development to the health workers’ “strong unity, collective action and continuous and tireless insistence,” which pushed the DOH and Department of Budget and Management (DBM) to release their “much-deserved” incentive. “The release of the HEA is a significant victory for our health workers who have been at the forefront of the battle against the COVID-19 pandemic. These dedicated individuals have worked selflessly to provide care and support to patients, often putting their own health and their family’s safety at risk,” the group said in a statement. “However, health workers still have a long way to go in our fight for these benefits because the HEA of our fellow health workers in private and local government hospitals is not yet released,” it added. The payment of the allowance is provided for under Republic Act No. 11712, or the Public Health Emergency Benefits and Allowances for Health Care Workers Act, which was enacted on April 27, 2022. Under the law, healthcare workers are entitled to the health emergency allowance for every month of service while the country is under a state of public health emergency. The allowance is P3,000 for those deployed to low-risk areas, P6,000 for those in medium-risk areas, and P9,000 for those in high-risk areas. READ: COVID-19 frontliners in Cebu City gov’t hospitals to receive financial incentives Under the 2024 national budget, P19.96 billion has been allocated to cover the backlog of payments for HEA claims submitted by workers in both public and private hospitals. Since 2020, the DBM said it has already released P90 billion to the DOH for HEA claims. In December last year, Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa projected that it would take until 2026 for the government to pay in full its past-due obligations amounting to P62.9 billion to all eligible workers who served during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

    "article_body": "The Office of the Ombudsman has directed the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) to dismiss Jo Mark Libre, one of the commissioners appointed by former President Rodrigo Duterte, for supposedly putting relatives in government positions under his direct supervision. For being found in violation of civil service rules against nepotism and grave misconduct, Libre was removed from service last week and perpetually disqualified from holding public office. His retirement benefits, except for leave credits, were also canceled. The Ombudsman’s order cited complaints about Libre appointing his relatives to positions under his office. It also cited an earlier complaint against Libre in the Civil Service Commission (CSC), which found him in 2019 guilty of grave misconduct, serious dishonesty, fabrication of official documents, and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of service. CSC said Libre was subjected to penalties, which included dismissal from service, cancellation of eligibility, perpetual disqualification from holding public office, and prohibition from taking any Civil Service Examinations. READ: Guanzon asks Ombudsman for fairness, seeks reconsideration of graft raps READ: SC upholds Ombudsman’s decision vs Napoles, ex-DBM officials Another executive facing complaint Despite this, Libre joined CHEd on Feb. 9, 2022, with a three-year term after President Duterte named him one of the newest commissioners, along with Marita Canapi. During the Senate deliberations last year on the proposed P30.99-billion budget of CHEd for 2024, lawmakers also called the attention of Chair Prospero de Vera about the displeasure of some officials of state universities and colleges (SUCs) against Libre. Citing a letter supposedly sent to them by unnamed SUC officials, Libre was accused of “arbitrarily” designating a resource speaker in governing board meetings of SUCs and compelling the school to pay the official’s honorarium, hotel and travel expenses. In response to the Ombudsman order, De Vera said he has issued a memorandum transferring the 24 SUCs under Libre’s watch to other CHEd commissioners “to ensure the continuity of educational services and programs.” The ousted commissioner served as chair-designate of the board of regents in these SUCs. Based on the official announcement of his appointment, Libre was formerly the vice president for communications and external affairs at Jose Maria College Foundation Inc. in Davao City. He received his political science degree at the Ateneo de Davao University. He was later granted a CHEd scholarship to pursue a master’s degree in political science, majoring in global politics at the Ateneo de Manila University. The remaining CHEd commissioners at the agency are Canapi, Ronald Adamat, and Aldrin Darilag. Darilag, however, is also facing complaints before the Office of the President for purportedly sending his wife, who is not a CHEd employee, on an official business trip to Canada.",

    "article_body": "The Land Transportation Office (LTO) on Saturday said it launched a hotline for complaints about traffic violations as well as online scams. Assistant Secretary Vigor Mendoza II, LTO chief, said the hotline will not only cater to phishing scams but also abusive and erring motorists on the roads. He said the “Aksyon on the Spot” hotline is aimed at ensuring quick response from the government against erring motorists in line with the instruction of Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista. Through the hotline, road users are encouraged to send messages to 0929-2920865 if they cross paths with abusive or erring motorists on the road. Mendoza said LTO personnel will be distributing “Aksyon on the Spot” stickers to motorists, especially those who will be renewing the license registration of their respective motor vehicles. The purpose, he said, is to take advantage of the feature of the hotline, which also carries a QR code that will provide access to the complainants to formally lodge their complaints. “We guarantee our countrymen that any information that they will give us through the hotline shall be treated as confidential and protected by our Data Privacy law. We encourage the public to inform us of any abusive behavior on the road and we’ll take care of action,” he added. The LTO chief on Friday warned the public about online scammers engaged in tricking people to disclose private financial information by making them believe they have to pay fines from supposed traffic violations. —JEROME ANING",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines —The 15 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines that will go to waste in the next seven months should serve as a lesson on procurement practices in the government, Maria Rosario Vergeire, the officer in charge of the Department of Health (DOH), said in a briefing on Tuesday. “Regarding the procurement, it was just the national government [who led] at the time [when] a lot of things were uncertain. But the private sector and the local governments really worked on procuring their own vaccines because they wanted to help,” she told reporters. Vergeire said that by the time the supplemental deliveries of private companies and local governments arrived in the country, the national government had already inoculated their intended beneficiaries. This led to a “slight oversupply” of COVID-19 vaccines in the country’s stockpile, she added, noting that in cases when demand is not too high, the national government should just take the lead and manage procurement. “We need to plan carefully so we can learn from the past issues [and] be able to improve on our procurement practices,” Vergeire said. About 15.3 million COVID-19 jabs in the country are set to expire from March to October, raising the current vaccine wastage to almost 60 million doses by the latter part of the year. But Vergeire clarified that, of the 15.3 million jabs, almost 7 million were in “quarantine” while the DOH waits for the Food and Drug Administration and vaccine manufacturers to decide whether their shelf life could be extended. The DOH’s latest case bulletin, meanwhile, showed a slight increase in daily COVID-19 infections in the past week, with only one confirmed case suffering severe and critical symptoms. From March 6 to March 12, there were a total of 938 cases, or a daily average of 140 cases, a 7-percent increase compared to the previous week’s 130 cases. Separate DOH data on Tuesday showed “incremental increases” in COVID-19 trends in Metro Manila and Mindanao, while other areas in the country were plateauing in recent weeks. Among those hospitalized, 2,916 or 17.1 percent were in non-intensive care unit (ICU) beds, while 265 or 13.4 percent were admitted to the ICU. A total of 58 fatalities were confirmed in the recent week but only one of them occurred this month. The rest were backlogs from as early as March 2021. An additional 4,207 individuals were vaccinated with primary series shots last week, pushing the fully vaccinated to a total of 78.4 million. However, only 23.8 million or 30.3 percent of the fully vaccinated individuals had availed themselves of first booster shots as of March 12. Vergeire stressed that the country was still not out of the emergency phase of the pandemic despite cases and hospitalizations remaining “manageable.” “I can’t say that by May or June, the emergency [phase] in the country would be over. But what I can tell you confidently is [that] we are able to manage the situation,” she said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) further reduced the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) per kilogram (kg) for imported rice from P49 to P45, effective on March 31. In a statement on Wednesday, the DA said it slashed the price ceiling for the imported staple in response to the softening of global rice prices. “At this level, the retail price of imported rice has now decreased by P19 per kilo compared to its price before we implemented the MSRP on Jan. 20,” Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said. This is the fourth reduction since the DA first introduced the MSRP for imported rice two months ago to arrest rising retail prices despite reducing the tariff rate from 35 percent to 15 percent effective July 2024. READ: DA further cuts rice retail prices by P2-P3 “The implementation of the MSRP followed consultations with industry stakeholders to ensure that price reductions would not destabilize the rice industry or compromise food security,” the DA said. The DA initially set the price ceiling for imported premium rice at P58 a kilo on Jan. 20. It was dropped to P55 per kg on Feb. 5 before it was further reduced to P52 per kg on Feb. 15. As of March 10, it was pegged at P49 per kg. As of March 25, the price of imported regular and well-milled rice per kg was between P35 and P46, as opposed to P38 to P50 on Jan. 20, the first day of MSRP implementation, based on the DA’s price monitoring of Metro Manila markets. According to the DA, rice prices worldwide have dropped to their lowest levels in over two years, with some varieties now priced below $380 per metric ton (MT). Before this, it noted that the price of good-quality rice from Vietnam (5-percent broken grains) slid down to $490 per MT in March. Vietnam is the country’s leading imported rice supplier. Furthermore, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations earlier reported that the FAO All Rice Price Index averaged 105.9 points in February, down by 6.8 percent from 113.6 points in January. This benchmark is based on 21 rice export quotations across the four grain varieties—indica, aromatic, japonica, and glutinous. “The falls were driven by a combination of generally weak import demand, progress of the winter-spring harvest in Vietnam, and favorable prospects for offseason crops in India and Thailand,” the FAO report said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla has ordered an investigation into the Bureau of Immigration’s (BI) alleged issuance of thousands of prearranged employment visas, also known as 9G visas, to foreigners supposedly working for over 500 local companies that turned out to be fake. “We found that many corporations petitioning for 9G visas are fake corporations, nonentities which the legal department of the BI allowed,” Remulla told reporters on Tuesday. A 9G visa is issued by the immigration bureau to foreigners working for local companies that must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Remulla said that during a meeting with BI officials on Monday, he asked them “not to grant any more visas to sole proprietorships but only to corporations that have the stamp approval of the SEC.” The fake corporations, according to the justice secretary, had claimed to be local companies applying for visas for foreign nationals who would supposedly be working for them in the Philippines. Remulla, who described the latest immigration scam as an “affront to our sovereignty,” said that the supposed companies’ applications for 9G visas were approved by the BI “hook, line and sinker” without any verification being made first with the SEC. He added that more than 500 fake corporations could be involved, “many of these Pogo (Philippine offshore gaming operator) companies, along with “thousands and thousands of visas issued with the petition of these corporations.” The visas were “presumed to have been validated by the [immigration bureau’s] legal department and visa issuing authority,” Remulla said, adding that the BI’s legal officers could end up being implicated in the investigation he had ordered to determine, among others, when the fraudulent practice started. Asked about what would happen to the foreigners who were issued 9G visas through fake companies, Remulla replied: “Then [they] don’t have a reason to be in this country.” Tip of iceberg He pointed out, however, that they still had to dig deeper “because it’s just the tip of the iceberg.” “I will be asking for a fuller investigation and that’s what we discussed yesterday. I am challenging the immigration commissioner to [make] this matter as a priority so that we stop making [fools] of Filipinos,” Remulla said. In particular, he called on the bureau to release all its documents and relieve or change the personnel in its records section because “they could burn the files.” Remulla said they were also reconsidering availing of a third-party validation system for issuing Philippine visas, citing how European countries were tapping a visa outsourcing and technology services specialist to manage the issuance of visas and passports to clients. In October 2023, he disclosed that the DOJ was monitoring the possible resurgence of an “escort service” like the so-called “pastillas” bribery scheme through which immigration personnel were allegedly allowing the entry or exit of passengers with questionable documents. In June 2022, 45 BI employees were dismissed after the Office of the Ombudsman found them “administratively liable” for grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service for accepting bribes from foreigners, mostly Chinese nationals, in exchange for giving them special treatment upon their arrival in the country.",

At least 5,000 members of the Angat Kooperatiba at Korporasyon ng Alyansang Pilipino para sa Modernisasyon (Akkap Mo) will start their march at 6 a.m. from Welcome Rotunda to the gates of Malacañang in Mendiola to urge President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. not to heed the call of the 22 senators to suspend the the PUVMP—now called the Public Transport Modernization Program. Don’t dupe people “We needed to do this protest action because the senators might dupe the President [to actually suspend the PUVMP]. Our members are furious, because we are the ones who complied with the government’s programs, and now, we’re the ones being neglected,” said Ed Comia, chair of Metro Comet Transport Service Cooperative, which will join the unity walk. https://youtu.be/P35nX4G-_8c The groups apologized in advance to the public who would be inconvenienced by their protest, which they described as a “show of force of the majority” that supports the PUVMP. “We do not want to paralyze the transport sector on Monday. But worse comes to worst, we can really stop the economy from running if we stop our transport operations,” Comia said. Members of the “Magnificent 7,” composed of the largest transport groups in the country, which also made a similar call opposing the deferment of the PUVMP, however, will not join the protest.",

    "article_body": "Transport group Manibela again threatened that its members, numbering up to 200,000, may just decide to spark another transportation crisis because of the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program (PUVMP). “After today, we may stop going out on the road,” Manibela president Mar Valbuena said in a radio interview, insisting that his group was not blackmailing the government. “After our protest today, we may decide if we will make our transport strike permanent by not returning to ferry passengers,” Valbuena said on the last of their three-day transport strike. Manibela and another transport group, Piston, carried out this week separate three-day transport strikes in different parts of the country to protest the Dec. 31 deadline for franchise consolidation applications under the PUVMP. Under the program, PUV franchise holders are required to upgrade their vehicles with newer and larger units by “consolidating” with other franchise holders in cooperatives or corporations that are expected to have resources to acquire acceptable, but more expensive, vehicles. The move is envisioned to increase PUV passenger capacities while reducing vehicle emissions and increasing driver or operator accountability. 6-year talks The PUVMP has been under discussion since 2017 with the government expressing willingness to reasonably adjust deadlines while franchise holders have repeatedly pushed postponements of the program by threatening a repeat of the last transportation crisis that occurred in the late 1980s under the administration of former President Corazon Aquino. Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista, however, earlier said the consolidation requirement of PUV operators and drivers into cooperatives or corporations was “nonnegotiable.” In a statement on Friday, Celine Pialago, spokesperson for the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB), said they were still evaluating the overall impact of Manibela’s transport strike. “Our initial assessment showed that their transport strike only had minimal impact,” she said. The LTFRB claimed that majority of drivers and operators were positive about franchise consolidation to make applying for loans easier and more efficient. As of Oct. 31, a total of 109,017, or 56.7 percent of the public utility jeepneys and UV Express vans, have consolidated to form cooperatives or corporations. These PUV units cover a total of 4,108 routes, or 61.9 percent of all the routes nationwide. No phaseout ... yet The LTFRB earlier clarified that traditional jeepneys would still be allowed to ply the roads as long as they were able to file their petition for consolidation by Dec. 31, and their units are deemed roadworthy by the Land Transportation Office. “The consolidation component is important for the government to check the quality of the PUV units, and to check the documents of the cooperatives or corporations under the PUVMP,” Pialago explained. READ: Another 3-day strike set, this time by Manibela If drivers and operators fail to consolidate by the end of the year, they would still be allowed to operate, considering the expected shortage in of PUVs in some routes. But those who fail to apply for consolidation will have to wait for the next omnibus franchise guidelines, which could take up to 27 months, or apply for social support from the Department of Labor and Employment and Technical Education and Skills Development Authority.",

    "article_body": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday said two of the four Japanese fugitives detained in the country had been cleared for deportation, and that it intended to have all of them returned to their home country before President Marcos goes to Tokyo next week for a five-day working visit. The Japanese government has sought the deportation of the fugitives, who are alleged to be remotely running a robbery syndicate in Japan via encrypted messaging. On Wednesday, Japanese Embassy officials met with Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla to again discuss their deportation request. Remulla on Friday said, “We want everybody cleared by next week and we’re working toward that end. Before [the President] departs [for Japan], we will have this case finished hopefully.” Two of the detained fugitives, however, still have pending cases in court which could stall their return to their home country. Yuki Watanabe and Tomonobu Saito had been charged by their respective Filipino companions with violation of Republic Act No. 9262, or the Violence Against Women and their Children Act. ‘Distraction’ On Thursday, Watanabe’s lawyer, Eljun Rico, said a motion by prosecutors to dismiss his case was “impliedly denied” because the proceedings continued. Rico also disputed Remulla’s claim that the case was contrived, arguing that Watanabe had been indicted. The justice chief had said the cases against the Japanese nationals were “being used by their lawyers to prevent them from leaving the country.” He also expressed doubts about their accusers, as he said about Watanabe’s case: “Why would a woman [who was] wronged and had filed a case be visiting her boyfriend?” On Friday, the DOJ filed a motion to fast-track the dismissal of the charges against Watanabe and Saito. Remulla expressed confidence that these cases will be resolved by Monday. He had said earlier that the government did not want this matter to be a “distraction” and “focus of media” during Mr. Marcos’ visit to Japan. ‘Luffy’ Watanabe, 38, is suspected in Japan to be “Luffy,” the leader of the robbery group, whom Japanese media named after an anime character. Saito, 45, and Toshiya Fujita and Kiyoto Imamura, both 38, had been tagged by Japanese police as his alleged accomplices. Imamura is not facing any charges and is thus due for deportation, while Fujita was slapped with a light threat charge which was dismissed last Wednesday upon the prosecution’s own motion. The complainant, lawyer Francis Alcantara, did not appear in that hearing. All four are currently detained at the Bicutan Detention Center of the Bureau of Immigration (BI). Raid, relief On Friday, the BI said it had relieved 36 of its staff members there, after a raid on Tuesday led to the confiscation of iPhones, laptops, internet routers and more than P500,000 in cash. Following Tuesday’s raid, Remulla said the DOJ will investigate BI personnel who may have allowed the fugitives to continue their enterprise. “I want the deportation done first before we do our accounting within the department. But we will make people account for everything after the deportation,” he said. BI Commissioner Norman Tansingco said the raid took all of three hours and involved 49 operatives of the agency’s Intelligence Division and 84 officers from the National Capital Region Police Office. —REPORTS FROM ANGEL YABUT, DEXTER CABALZA AND TINA G.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The government will impose a maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) for imported rice at P58 per kilo, with the country’s agriculture chief saying this would initially cover Metro Manila beginning Jan. 20. Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the decision came following a series of “extensive consultations” with industry players, such as importers and retailers, and government agencies, as they tried to tame increasing rice prices despite President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s tariff cuts and drop in global prices. He said the MSRP would be up for review every month to consider fresh factors affecting grain prices. Reducing the set MSRP remains on the table, Tiu Laurel noted. “We must ensure the price of rice is fair and affordable even as we make sure that the rice industry remains profitable. We cannot allow the greed of a few to jeopardize the well-being of an entire nation,” he said in a statement on Friday. “Based on our calculations, using data and profit margins provided by importers and retailers, imported 5 percent broken rice should not exceed P58 per kilo. For rice with a higher percentage of broken grains, the price should be much lower,” he added. Trade chief Cristina Roque also vowed that her department would “help in the monitoring and enforcement of prices set by the DA.”",

Tansingco added that part of the budget will also be for the procurement of body camera systems for secondary inspectors assigned at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport, and other provincial international airports, as well as the Zamboanga International Seaport.

    "article_body": "The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) on Thursday filed in the Department of Justice 69 criminal cases for tax evasion against traders of illegal cigarettes who were apprehended during raids conducted nationwide in January. “The total exposure we have filed here now, including penalties and fines, amounts to P1.8 billion,” BIR Commissioner Romeo Lumagui Jr. told reporters. In a statement, he said that the filing of cases was “a warning against illicit traders.” “The BIR will not only raid your stores and warehouses, we will also file criminal cases against you. This will not be the last,” said Lumagui who added that they were also constantly surveilling businesses. He warned erring operators that they would not only have to pay taxes with penalties and surcharges, but face jail time as well. According to the BIR, the government was losing from the illicit tobacco trade between P50 billion and P100 billion in tax revenues which could have been spent on basic services, including the universal health care program and other national development goals. The raids in January targeted 378 local cigarette stores and warehouses nationwide with cigarettes—either locally produced or smuggled into the country—that had fake or no BIR approved stamps. According to the BIR, among the “hotspots” for illicit cigarettes were Zamboanga and Pampanga provinces. Lumagui said that Marlboro, one of the most prominent tobacco companies in the world, was one of the brands being reproduced and smuggled into the country. He added that the BIR was trying to locate the factories producing the illegal and fake cigarettes, including vapes. Constant surveillance According to him, “the BIR protects the Philippine economy by leveling the playing field. Everybody has to pay taxes. Traders of cigarettes, vape, petroleum and other goods subject to taxes have to register with the BIR and pay their taxes.” “Failure to do so would force us to raid your stores and file criminal cases against you. We are in constant surveillance of your businesses. Not only will you have to pay your taxes with penalties and surcharges, but you will also lose your freedom,” he warned, The yearly collection of excise tax on tobacco products fell by 9 percent to P160.23 billion in 2022 from P176.49 billion in 2021. Earlier this month, Lumagui also warned sellers that pricing their products below the cost of production and excise taxes was prohibited. At the same time, he warned smokers that products sold at prices below the minimum allowed meant the items were illegal. The floor prices for cigarettes are pegged at P114.60 per pack and P1,146.00 per ream. In addition, heated tobacco products must be sold at at least P120.40 per pack; vapor products at P200 (2 ml) and P354.97 (4 ml), and a bottle of conventional freebase at P179.20 (10 ml) and P403.20 (30 ml). Lumagui said in a statement that sellers offering products below these floor prices were not paying the proper taxes. — WITH A REPORT FROM TETCH TORRES-TUPAS g/",

The DOH acknowledged efforts to legalize medical cannabis use; but it emphasized that such initiatives must be supported by studies that were weighted for cost-effectiveness and public health impact. \"Any such initiatives should be based on the best available scientific evidence, weighed for cost-effectiveness and public health impact. \" “Legislation should also consider the regulatory capacity of all government agencies that will be involved should there be approval,” the DOH said in a statement in response to the recent approval by joint House committees of a bill that seeks to legalize the medical use of marijuana. The health department reminded the public that any use of marijuana at this point is punishable by law, unless granted a compassionate special permit by the Food and Drug Administration Director General. This special permit allows the use and importation of such products in the country. The Philippine Medical Association (PMA) , in a statement last February 6, opposed any new legislation that legalizes the use of cannabis. “The medical community supports the use of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved medical cannabis preparations for specific indications,” the PMA said in a statement. “[However], there is no need for new legislation to access FDA approved medical cannabis for specific indications. Legislation will not be able to catch up with the advances in health technology, and health technology should not be legislated,” it added.",

No one wants to skip school but how can we protect ourselves if we’re not empowered, educated and engaged about our data?” Leachon said in a virtual presser. “We have long been waiting [for the COVID-19 data] but we still can’t see anything. This should be transparent and this should be discussed,” he added. While the DepEd earlier confirmed receiving reports about students, teachers, and nonteaching personnel who tested positive for the virus, it refused to disclose any data to avoid giving conflicting figures. Instead, Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte said that it should be up to the local governments to confirm any clustering of COVID-19 cases during the conduct of in-person classes. —JANE BAUTISTA RELATED STORIES So far, no COVID-19 clusters detected in schools – DOH DepEd policies to blame for COVID-19 cases in schools – ACT DepEd confirms COVID-19 cases in schools",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — In the face of continued threats in the West Philippines Sea, senators are gearing up to increase the budgets of the country’s defense and intelligence offices next year. In a closed-door meeting on Wednesday, the Senate finance subcommittee gave its nod to the proposed P1.432 billion budget of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency (Nica) and the P629.27 million funding of the National Security Council (NSC) next year. Though the two agencies were “contented” with their budget, senators still want more for them, Senate Deputy Majority Leader JV Ejercito said on Thursday. “Senators are the ones proposing that it be augmented because of the situation kasi nga magshi-shift na tayo sa external defense…” Ejercito at the regular Kapihan sa Senado forum. (Senators are the ones proposing that it be augmented because of the situation because we are about to shift to external defense…) “Kelangan natin ng drones and aircraft with sophisticated cameras. Yan na ang mga kailangan natin kasi kelangan nating bantayan kasi baka paggising natin ang dami ng isla.” “It’s the senators who are already offering to augment the budget of Nica and other intel agencies,” the senator said. Ejercito said the Senate will introduce amendments on the floor to augment the two agencies' budgets. Senators have yet to decide though how much they plan to increase the budgets of Nica and NSC. “No specific amount yet,” Ejercito said in a text message. “We will wait for the wishlist of Nica as requested by SP (Senate President Juan Miguel) Zubiri.” Aside from Nica and NSC, the senator also sees the need to raise the intelligence funds of the Department of National Defense (DND) and the country’s armed forces to prepare for “external defense.” Ejercito believes confidential, and intelligence funds (CIF) should be concentrated to agencies like DND, Armed Forces of the Philippines, Nica, and the Philippine National Police. Ejercito also observed that many civilian offices are now requesting the CIF when it should be confined to agencies in charge of national defense and security. “Parang hawa-hawa lang,” he said.

READ: Ex-TV reporter Jay Ruiz is new acting PCO chief However, a copy of the memorandum furnished to the Inquirer showed that the directive was received by one of the PCO’s attached state-run firms only on Feb. 27, or a day before the deadline. A source also confirmed to the Inquirer that the memorandum was only downloaded to offices on Feb. 27. “In the exigency of service, and in order to give the new PCO secretary a free hand in performing his duties and functions, all incumbent presidential appointees in agencies, offices and bureaus under the PCO are hereby directed to render their UNQUALIFIED COURTESY RESIGNATIONS, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations,” Bersamin’s memorandum read. The directive covered presidential appointees in PCO agencies, offices and bureaus “whose appointments are not permanent.” It also applied to presidential appointees in government-owned and -controlled corporations (GOCCs) attached to the PCO “whose appointments are in acting capacity, as well as those who are in holdover status.” Courtesy resignations in the government usually apply to coterminous appointees, which means that their appointment is coexistent with the tenure of the President or the appointing officer or authority. This usually covers undersecretaries down to directors of government agencies and the heads of attached agencies and GOCCs.",

    "article_body": "The recently ratified Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) free trade agreement is projected to boost the country’s agricultural exports, officials of the Department of Agriculture (DA) and Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said on Saturday. Speaking at a news forum, Maria Tisha dela Rosa, chief of the macro-economic policy division at the DA’s Policy Research Service, said RCEP would basically improve the agricultural exports of the country, allaying fears of some quarters that it would liberalize the agricultural sector even more. “Definitely it is not something that we have to fear because it will not liberalize the agri sector more than what it is now. Because when we were negotiating RCEP, we did not lower the tariff to more than what is provided under the existing trade regime,” she said. The DA official cited that even before the ratification of the RCEP, the Philippines already had a “liberalized” trading regime when it came to Australia, New Zealand, Japan, Korea and member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. “Instead, we would like to look at RCEP as a venue to strengthen our exports because we can get benefits or concessions from it that will help our agri exporters,” Dela Rosa added. The farmer and fisherfolk sectors should also not worry because the government has already adopted some safety nets, such as placing under an exclusion list so-called sensitive products of the country such as meat, rice, corn and sugar, among others, she added. Bianca Pearl Sykimte, assistant director at the DTI-Export Marketing Bureau said the RCEP would make the production cost globally competitive. “Not everything we needed in producing food are right in the Philippines. Example, there are cheaper fertilizer from other places so under RCEP, we can get cheaper fertilizer from other countries and then our production cost will be competitive,” she said. Based on the study by the International Trade Center based in Geneva, Switzerland, Sykimte said the Philippines has a $27.8 billion “unrealized export potential” to the RCEP countries in the next five years. The DA, according to Dela Rosa, is also partnering with the DTI in promoting Philippine exports. “More than export, the DA is in charge of production. There’s no food to export if there’s no [local] production. So that’s what the DA is doing now, to give the proper support [to agriculture],” she said. Increasing production of food intended for export will also create more jobs for Filipinos, Dela Rosa added.

    "article_body": "The investigation into the murder of journalist Percival “Percy Lapid” Mabasa has uncovered how the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) has turned into a big “criminal organization,” officials said on Monday. “What was discovered from the in-depth investigation of Mr. Lapid’s death was the unfortunate transformation of a pillar of justice—the correction pillar— into a deep, large-scale and systematic criminal organization,” said a joint statement by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG). “A criminal organization exists and is embedded within a government office, and that office is none other than the [BuCor], which controls what the United Nations Office on Crime and Drugs describes as the biggest mega prison in the world,” it added. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla pointed to the recent confiscation of contraband goods, including illegal drugs, from inside New Bilibid Prison (NBP) as proof of criminal activities. “I would say that the beer that was found, that was surrendered by the people, the drugs, computers, telephones, weapons inside Bilibid is a very, very strong indication of the presence of a criminal organization,” he said in a news conference. “With a centralized purchasing system, a centralized way of doing contraband selling within a prison system, I think that that itself would tell you there is a criminal organization lurking within,” he added. He did not give an idea as to how long the criminal activities have been going on inside Bilibid. Remulla said an investigation was underway into the deaths of “more than 30” people whose corpses were found inside the Easter Funeral Services in Muntinlupa City alongside that of Cristito Villamor Palaña, who was allegedly killed by his fellow prisoners upon the orders of suspended BuCor chief Gerald Bantag and BuCor superintendent Ricardo Zulueta on Oct. 18 to cover up the conspiracy for Mabasa’s killing. “We will study it and maybe we can know how long this has been going on, but definitely there has been criminal activity going on inside the NBP,” said Remulla. Bantag, a controversial jail warden whom then President Rodrigo Duterte assigned in 2019 to head BuCor and clean up NBP, is facing murder charges along with Zulueta and 10 inmates for the killing of Mabasa and Palaña, who was earlier implicated as a “middleman” in the plot.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Some power plants with a combined capacity of 300 megawatts (MW), mostly renewable energy projects, will serve as additional power supply sources to the country amid the dry spell caused by the El Niño phenomenon, the Department of Energy (DOE) said on Monday. During the government’s televised “Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon” program, Energy Assistant Secretary Mario Marasigan said some coal, solar, biomass and hydropower plants, the majority of which were located in Luzon, would go online this summer. In a separate message, Marasigan said Unit 1 of the Mariveles coal-fired power plant in Bataan province, which could generate 150 MW, would be commissioned during the period. According to him, several hydropower projects with aggregate capacities of around 20 MW, a geothermal (binary) project of 29 MW and solar power projects with total capacities of around 104 MW will also be switched on. “Based on our monitoring and assessments, we do not expect any shortage in electricity supply and the current demand has not yet reached our projected peak demand this year,” Marasigan said. READ: DOE: Power supply in Luzon, Mindanao sufficient; thin in Visayas READ: Higher electricity prices forecast until May Estimated peak demand The DOE, he added, estimated that electricity demand in the Luzon grid this year may reach a peak of 13,917 MW, an increment of 10 percent from last year’s peak demand of 12,550 MW. Peak demand in the Visayas is pegged at 2,891 MW, up by 17.6 percent from last year’s 2,458 MW, while in Mindanao, peak demand is anticipated to rise by 11.6 percent from 2,315 MW. “We still have a gap of about 2,000 MW in Luzon, while in [the Visayas and Mindanao], there is still around 200 to 500 MW shortfall in the estimated peak demands this year,” he added. Furthermore, the 230-kilovolt Cebu-Negros-Panay Stage 3 interconnection project of the National Grid Corp. of the Philippines (NGCP), designed to ensure the reliability and security of supply in Negros and Panay, was completed last week. Marasigan said that with the energization of the project, the capacity to transfer power supply to and from these areas has increased to 400 MW from the previous 180 MW. “[In the] past week, the system operator assured us the transfer capacity from Cebu to Negros is available,” he said. On the other hand, the Mindanao-Visayas Interconnection Project, which started commercial operations this year, will ensure enough power supply in the Visayas. The NGCP project unified three major power grids in the country, allowing energy resource sharing as any excess power from one grid may be transmitted to another. “We foresee a lack of electricity in the Visayas if power generation only comes from the [area],” Marasigan said.

The journalists were being asked to sign the inventory form of the illegal substances seized from two Chinese nationals as part of the customary procedures in a buy-bust conducted by agents of the NBI’s Task Force on Anti-Illegal Drugs along Roxas Boulevard in Pasay City around 1 a.m. on Friday. The reporters, however, refused to sign the documents, saying they only arrived at the scene after the operation, prompting an NBI agent to hurl insults at the reporters. “It’s your obligation, you’re here. Be witnesses,” one of the NBI agents told the media present. An NBI agent even pointed a finger at dzBB reporter Olan Bola. PTV reporter Noel Talacay was also harassed by an NBI agent. But Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla stressed that journalists “have no duty to testify if you were really not part of it.” “Members of the media should have been at the raid itself,” he told reporters on Friday.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The reclamation projects in Manila Bay were actually designed to shield the communities along its coast from tsunamis and storm surges, an official of the Philippine Reclamation Authority (PRA) claimed on Sunday. “The reason why these reclamation projects were on a higher elevation is that these also serve as coastal protection,” PRA Assistant General Manager Joseph Literal said in a statement. Contrary to the fears of some senators, Literal said the reclamation activities would not worsen the flooding in the metropolis since they were designed with “climate change projections” in mind. The expansion of the coastal areas used the sprawling SM Mall of Asia complex in Pasay City as its baseline, according to the PRA official. Literal also clarified that of the 22 reclamation projects that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources suspended, only 13 were in Manila Bay. “These projects are handled by various local governments, such as Navotas, Manila, Pasay, Parañaque, Las Piñas, Bacoor and the province of Cavite,” he said. Two weeks ago, President Marcos said only one of the ongoing reclamation activities was allowed to continue pending the review being conducted by the government. As to concerns that the construction of the man-made coastal lands would block the picturesque sunset in Manila Bay, the PRA official said the public would actually have “a bigger viewing deck” once the reclaimed areas are completed. Said Literal: “The people in Metro Manila will have opportunities to view the sunset from different vantage points.” “There will be no obstruction,” he stressed, “since they will be at the front of Manila Bay.” RELATED STORIES Suspension of Manila Bay reclamation: Why Bongbong Marcos’ order should be on paper DOLE ready to assist workers idled by suspended Manila Bay reclamation projects Dredging persists in Cavite despite order suspending Manila Bay reclamation",

The data from July 26 to Aug. 1 showed that both were local cases, with one patient residing in Metro Manila, and the other in the Cordillera Administrative Region. The two samples identified with the latest COVID-19 strain in the country was part of the 767 positive cases sequenced by the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine and the laboratories of the University of the Philippines-Philippine Genome Center in Quezon City and Mindanao. The first 10 cases of the EG.5 in the country were detected in the genome sequencing conducted in mid-July. A sublineage of Omicron XBB.1.9.2, EG.5 was classified as a “variant under monitoring”—two levels below the highest category variant of concern—on July 19. The DOH has also said that there is no current evidence that points to EG.5 as more severe compared to the original Omicron variant. The various sublineages of XBB, including the EG.5, remain the dominant strains circulating in the country, accounting for 84.4 percent of sequenced COVID-19 samples. All are local infections, except for two XBB cases that came from returning Filipinos.

The successive raids on illegal Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) have resulted in the sudden drop in scam text messages that Filipinos used to receive on a daily basis, Sen. Sherwin “Win” Gatchalian said on Saturday. According to Gatchalian, this was yet another proof that Pogos were indeed behind a modus operandi that had pestered—if not victimized—thousands of mobile phone users since the pandemic years. READ: Pogo ban just first step He said the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) should take advantage of the situation by fully enforcing Republic Act No. 11934, or the Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) Registration Act. “The NTC should be strict in implementing the SIM registration law and proactive in plugging the gaps,” Gatchalian told the Inquirer. READ: Better implementation of SIM card registration law pushed He stressed a major reason why Pogo hubs proliferated in the Philippines was “because NTC has been lax in implementing the law.” From Senate probe to Sona The senator said he first learned about the marked reduction in the number of spam messages from barangay officials in his hometown of Valenzuela City. “I also observed that. It was obvious that these Pogo hubs started to target locals and lure them to their scamming activities. Crimes know no boundaries,” he added. Gatchalian and Sen. Risa Hontiveros have spearheaded a Senate investigation into serious crimes being linked to Pogos, like kidnapping, torture, human trafficking, cyberscams and murder. The inquiry resulted in the authorities, particularly the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission, becoming more aggressive in conducting raids on Pogos suspected of being fronts for organized crime. Amid mounting calls to ban such establishments, President Marcos announced a nationwide ban on Pogos during his third State of the Nation Address (Sona) on July 22. “Disguising as legitimate entities, their operations have ventured into illicit areas furthest from gaming, such as financial scamming, money laundering, prostitution, human trafficking, kidnapping, brutal torture, (and) even murder,” the President said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines— Opposition Senator Risa Hontiveros is proposing a Senate inquiry into the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) issuance of a cease and desist order (CDO) against a private orphanage in Quezon City. The probe to be conducted by the Senate committee on women, children, family relations, and gender equality being headed by Hontiveros is being sought through her Senate Resolution No. 643 she filed this Monday. In the resolution, Hontiveros cited the removal of 149 children from Gentle Hands Inc. (GHI) following the CDO issued last week by the DSWD for various violations, such as overcrowding and sanitation concerns. The children were transferred to state-run facilities in Mandaluyong City, Quezon City, and Muntinlupa City. “According to GHI, the actions of the DSWD were traumatizing for the children, many of whom already suffer from the wounds of abandonment and abuse,” Hontiveros said in the resolution. Many of these children, she said, also have specific needs, including some who require medical attention and psycho-social counseling. “While the safety and adequacy of living standards are important concerns, it is also important to determine whether or not the correct processes were followed in the removal of the children from a child care facility subject to a CDO, and whether or not these processes are informed by the best interests of the child doctrine,” the senator stressed. Hontiveros said it is imperative for the Senate “to exercise the necessary oversight to check adherence to state policies and most importantly, to ensure that the best interest of the child [is] always upheld.” The issuance of the CDO against the GHI stemmed from a private individual's complaint that the orphanage violated Republic Act No. 7610 or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. DSWD officials led by Secretary Rex Gatchalian confirmed some of these violations when they conducted a surprise visit to the orphanage. “The worst part of it all is [when] we saw the fire exits, and they were sealed or had grills . That was not acceptable to us. That’s a walking fire trap,” according to Gatchalian. He also pointed out that the orphanage housed 149 children when it was supposed to accommodate only 80. gsg/abc",

    "article_body": "Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte hoped that ACT Teachers Rep. France Castro was relishing the thought of her impeachment because questions about Duterte’s discretionary funds will soon be answered. “I hope she finds gratification and great joy over the thought of my impeachment ... Enjoy,” Duterte said in a caustic response to Castro’s statement that she was studying the Vice President’s impeachment. During a House hearing on the budget of the Commission on Audit (COA), Gamaliel Cordoba, chair of COA, confirmed that the Office of the Vice President (OVP) reported P125 million in confidential expenses for 2022. The lawmaker said Duterte should explain “how she could incur obligations amounting to P125 million in confidential expenses in the last six months of 2022 [although] her office has no congressional authorization to do so for that year.” ‘How P125 million was spent’ “Without such congressional authorization, the strict rule prohibiting public disclosure of the use of confidential funds does not apply in this case. Therefore, we ask that the OVP provide a detailed public accounting of how the P125 million was spent,” Castro said. “In light of the possible numerous violations of the OVP on the use of P125 million confidential fund, which is not in the 2022 General Appropriations Act, the Makabayan bloc is not discounting the fact that it may file an impeachment case against the Vice President,” she added in a message to the Inquirer. “Where did the funds come from? How was it spent? This is very, very questionable. We will eventually reach that point of deciding whether to file an impeachment case, once we have completed our data, information and documents.” Ground for impeachment She said the House appropriations committee has already directed the COA to submit a report on the OVP’s confidential funds in 2022 and the three-member Makabayan bloc was waiting for the report. “We will study the possibility of making her accountable if there are really violations of the law,” Castro said in a press conference on Friday. “Especially on the misuse of public funds and technical malversation and violating the 1987 Constitution because a government official is bound to follow the Constitution, and it’s a ground for impeachment, if you don’t,” she added.

    "article_body": "Opposition lawmaker and Gabriela Rep. Arlene Brosas on Friday warned Vice President Sara Duterte that her resignation as education secretary does not not excuse her from attending upcoming budget deliberations to explain the issues concerning the country’s worsening education system, which she had led for at least two years. In a statement, Brosas, also House assistant minority leader, said that Duterte would still have to be scrutinized for her “dismal performance” as education chief, during which the Philippines ranked low in almost all global tests measuring student competencies. On Wednesday, the day Duterte announced her resignation, the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) released a report saying Filipino students lagged behind in terms of creative thinking compared to students in other countries. READ: Sara Duterte leaves unfinished business at DepEd With a Pisa score of 14, the Philippines ranked 60 out of 62 countries and economies that participated in the assessment. Based on the second Department of Education (DepEd)Basic Education Report that she released last January, the DepEd also built only around 3,600 classrooms in 2023 out of the planned 6,300. President Marcos, meanwhile, has yet to signal whom he wants to take over the DepEd portfolio following Duterte’s resignation. Albay Rep. Joey Salceda said he recommended Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) chair Prospero de Vera and Synergeia Foundation head Milwida “Nene” Guevara as possible candidates. In picking them, Salceda noted De Vera’s tenure as CHEd chair would help streamline programs with the basic education under the DepEd. Meanwhile, Synergeia Foundation, under Guevarra’s leadership, has also been the strongest champion in convening the second Congressional Commission on Education, the national commission tasked to review and evaluate the performance of the country’s basic education sector. “No one has been earlier and more consistent about the longstanding issues affecting basic education. It’s Nene Guevara,” Salceda added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The government urged Filipinos, particularly those with young children, to take advantage of the ongoing vaccination drive against measles, rubella and polio and even asked private companies to encourage employees to join the immunization campaign. The Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) on Saturday encouraged private employers to allow or excuse from work employees accompanying their children during the ongoing nationwide vaccination drive against measles, rubella and polio. The guidelines, in support of the government’s nationwide immunization activity on April 1 to April 15, are contained in Labor Advisory No. 04, series of 2024, dated March 27 and signed by Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma. READ: Why vaccine-preventable diseases are back Under the advisory, private sector employers, particularly those with employees who have children aged six months to 59 months (4-year-old), are highly encouraged to allow their employees to be excused from work when they accompany their children on scheduled vaccination or when they must take care of their children who will experience adverse effects or reactions to the vaccine. Upon resumption of work, the concerned employee will present proof of vaccination. He or she may likewise be allowed to utilize available leave credits during the immunization activity subject to company policy or collective bargaining agreement granting the same. The Dole advised employers to coordinate with the health department of their respective local governments on the scheduled immunization to ensure availability of the vaccines. The department, meanwhile, said companies with institutionalized immunization programs are encouraged, through their occupational safety and health committees, to conduct the immunization activities in the establishments as part of their family welfare program. READ: Get children jabbed, doctors push parents Measles surge The Department of Health (DOH) has logged about 2,500 cases of measles nationwide, with 1,600 of which coming from the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) as many eligible children there remain unvaccinated against the disease. On Wednesday, Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said he cannot declare an outbreak nationwide because vaccination rates are high in other places, but the DOH aims to end the measles outbreak in the BARMM in four to six weeks. READ: In BARMM, religious leaders endorse measles vax to Muslims Vaccination vs measles In a national scale, the DOH aims to vaccinate 90 percent of children ages six months to 10 years to control cases of measles. Measles is a contagious disease that spreads in the air through coughing or sneezing. While it is more common among all children, it affects all age groups. As of April 10, the DOH said in a press statement it has vaccinated 646,840 children against measles. Herbosa said the figure translates to “47 percent of 1,381,540 million Filipino children who are eligible for vaccination against measles.” The statement added, “Of those vaccinated, 91,309 were six to 23 months old; 205,234 were two years old and below five years old; and 350,337 were five-to-nine years old.” The DOH joined a partnership with the World Health Organization, UN Childrens Fund (Unicef) and the BARMM Ministry of Health to undertake a free immunization drive. The Unicef will help buy 1 million doses of measles vaccines for BARMM and another 1 million “for the rest of the country.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has told the military to intensify its fight against terrorist financing to ensure that communist rebels would no longer have the platform to finance their operations. In a situation briefing at Camp General Macario Peralta Jr. in Jamindan, Capiz, on Friday, the president expressed confidence that Western Visayas would soon be free from communist insurgency given the decreasing number of communist rebels in the region. “Keep the pressure going ... I know that the other units are also doing it in terms of the financing. But perhaps, you could put more emphasis on that,” said Marcos, who was in Capiz on Friday to distribute sacks of seized smuggled rice and cash assistance to indigent families in the province. Based on the report by Maj. Gen. Marion Sison, commander of the 3rd Infantry Division of the Philippine Army, to the president, the armed group is taking advantage of minority groups, usually the indigenous peoples. “They would pose as a humanitarian group who seeks financing from international institutions but the money they would get from the approved project proposals they submit abroad would not be remitted fully to the projects of their target minority groups,” Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said in a statement. In July this year, the president signed Executive Order (EO) No. 33 , or the National Anti-Money Laundering, Counter-Terrorism Financing, and Counter-Proliferation Financing Strategy (NACS) 2023-2027. The EO directed government agencies to adopt a new strategy against money laundering and counterterrorism financing. The president, according to Garafil, is optimistic that declaring the Western Visayas region as “insurgency-free” was achievable. ‘It’s achievable’ “We must keep on going and we’ll wait for your invitation to come back when you declare this area insurgent-free ... I think it’s achievable,” Marcos said. In September this year, Marcos officially declared Palawan free from communist insurgency while the Davao region was also declared “insurgency-free” last year. National Security Adviser Eduardo Año, a former military chief, said in September that the decades-long communist insurgency in the country would end during Marcos’ term. “What we can see in the term of [President Marcos] is, finally, we can put an end to the local armed communist conflict, and from there, we will pursue developments and ensure the delivery of services,” Año said. But he admitted: “While we may not be able to attain this zero insurgents, but at least reduced to an irrelevant number that will not cause concern for peace and order.” In his second State of the Nation Address in July, the president said he would issue a proclamation granting amnesty to rebel returnees to complete their reintegration into society. After more than half a century of armed struggle, he said, “We have now progressed together toward peace and development.”",

    "article_body": "PAGUDPUD, Ilocos Norte— President Marcos inaugurated on Friday a 160-megawatt wind farm which will be the biggest in the country once completed. Joining Marcos in the inauguration were his eldest son, Ilocos Norte Rep. Ferdinand Alexander “Sandro” Marcos, Energy Secretary Raphael Lotilla and Ayala Corp. chair Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala, who also spoke at the inauguration. The P11.8-billion Pagudpud Wind Farm, spanning an area across the coastal village of Balaoi and neighboring Caunayan village, is a project of ACEN Corp., the listed energy platform of the Ayala group. In his speech, the President emphasized the need to tap alternative renewable and clean energy. “I am here today because it is important to highlight the importance of our shift from fossil fuels to renewables. And this is a very, very important and very, very large part of that shift that we are trying to implement in our energy mix,” Marcos said. “We need to continue building facilities like this because what is needed in the market today is clean energy,” he added. “It is a very proud day for me to see that what we had started has continued and it looks like it will further continue. After this, I hope that we will be coming back fairly soon to inaugurate the 100th turbine,” the President also said. Boost capacity Zobel de Ayala, in his speech, said the wind farm is already operating at 50-percent capacity, or 80 MW. The project must have a capacity of 160 MW by the end of 2025, in compliance with the Department of Energy’s Green Energy Auction Program. So far, 19 companies, including ACEN Corp., have been awarded supply contracts through that competitive-bidding program for renewable energy enterprises. Zobel de Ayala said the company further aims to boost the capacity of Pagudpud Wind Farm. “Once complete, ACEN will have a total of 360 MW of wind capacity across 99 wind turbine generators in Ilocos Norte,” he said. He said the project has so far provided more than 1,200 jobs to the local community since construction began in 2021. John Eric Francia, president of the company, said it was targeting to increase, by the end of the year, the wind farm’s capacity to 135 MW. Pagudpud Wind Farm could help provide power to 123,875 homes and avoid approximately 344,600 kilotons of carbon emission annually, the company said in a statement. Electricity costs The facility is the third such project in Ilocos Norte, after NorthWind Bangui Bay in Bangui town which began operations in 2005 and North Luzon Renewables, also in Pagudpud, which started operating in 2014. With the government aiming to expand the use of renewable energy in the country, Marcos in April issued an executive order (EO) to expedite the issuance of permits for offshore wind (OSW) power projects. In Executive Order No. 21, he cited Republic Act No. 9513 or the Renewable Energy Act of 2008, which mandates the government to accelerate the exploration and development of renewable energy resources such as wind, solar, hydroelectric, geothermal and sea energy. “OSW, if optimally developed, will play a major role in our country’s goal for a low-carbon future, improved energy security, and reduced dependence on import fuels,” the EO read. Mr. Marcos said wind power and other renewable energy sources would help bring down electricity costs in the country, as he cited 2019 data showing that the Philippines had the third most expensive power rates in the region, after Japan and Singapore.

Due to online complaints, the government replaced the One Health Pass with the eArrival Card which was issued to incoming travelers within 72 hours of their departure through the same website www.onehealthpass.com.ph. ‘Streamline’ entry procedures But starting Dec. 2, the One Health Pass website will no longer be available and inbound passengers accessing the website will be redirected to the new portal etravel.gov.ph. The Office of the Press Secretary said the new website was meant “to streamline” the country’s entry procedures and data collection processes. Travelers will need to provide their health, personal and flight details in the platform within 72 hours before their flight. This will also be the new contact tracing platform that will monitor if travelers have any ailment or disease to be monitored, not just COVID-19. After filling out the forms, a QR code will be provided which will serve as their health declaration upon arrival. The new platform will also contain the digital version of the arrival cards (contact tracing forms, health declaration forms) as the Bureau of Immigration (BI) will discontinue using paper arrival cards by Dec. 5. “The arrival cards and the One Health Pass were basically merged into one system. It’s very helpful for travelers, they don’t have to fill up so many forms asking the same thing over and over again” Dana Sandoval, the BI spokesperson, told the Inquirer.

READ: Media slay probe twist: Jailed ‘middleman’ dead In his June 27, order which was released on Thursday, presiding Judge Gener Gito of the Muntinlupa Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 206 found Sputnik gang commander Aldrin Galicia, Sputnik gang assistant commander Joseph Georfo, and Batang City Jail gang commander Alvin Labra guilty of being “accessories to the crime of murder.” The three, in addition to Mario Alvarez, a Sputnik gang member, were initially charged as principals but by “indispensable cooperation.” They were each sentenced to a prison term ranging from two years, four months, and a day up to eight years and a day. On top of this, they must pay Villamor’s kin P150,000 each in civil indemnity and total damages. ‘Direct participation’ Five other inmates—Sputnik gang members Alvarez, Christian Ramac, Ricky Salgado, Ronnie dela Cruz, and Joel Reyes—were convicted for being “accomplices” and sentenced from six years and a day up to 14 years, eight months and a day. They were also directed to pay their victim’s family P225,000 each in civil indemnity, moral and exemplary damages. Except for Alvarez, all four were originally charged as principals by “direct participation.” Villamor was found dead inside NBP after he was identified by self-confessed gunman Joel S. Escorial as the middleman in the plan to kill Lapid. The first autopsy performed by the National Bureau of Investigation showed that he died from natural causes but a second one conducted by independent forensic pathologist Dr. Raquel Fortun revealed that he was suffocated using a plastic bag. The court, meanwhile, ordered the archiving of the case against former Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director Gerald Bantag and his former deputy, Ricardo Zulueta, who both remain at large. “Considering that the other accused in this case, accused DG (Director General) Gerald Bantag y Quitaleg and CT/SSUPT. (Corrections Technical Senior Supt.) Ricardo Zulueta y Soriano, are not yet arrested, let this case be sent to the archive subject to revival upon arrest of said accused,” it said. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has offered a P3 million cash reward to anyone who can provide information about the former BuCor officials’ whereabouts. “We want law enforcers to be more aggressive in helping the DOJ arrest the suspects who allegedly conspired to kill Percy Lapid,” Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said at a press briefing on June 20. The DOJ also said that it had established “sufficient circumstantial evidence” to tag Bantag as the mastermind in the murders of Villamor and Lapid. On Friday, the Las Piñas RTC Branch 254 also sentenced Galicia and Labra, along with Happy Go Lucky gang commander Alfie Peñaredonda, to up to eight years in prison after they pleaded guilty to the murder of Lapid. Lapid, a known critic of Bantag, was the host of the online radio program “Percy Lapid Fire.” He was on his way home when he was shot dead by two men in October 2022.",

    "article_body": "Vice President Sara Duterte remained coy about her reasons for resigning as Department of Education (DepEd) secretary, saying only she did it for personal and professional reasons. “It’s a long story and we need to sit down to discuss it,” she told reporters on Thursday after a program where she turned over leadership of the DepEd to Sen. Juan Edgardo Angara. Duterte said one reason was “slightly personal” and had something to do with what she discussed with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. “before I agreed to run as [his] vice president.” Another was professional, while the other was “about the country,” she added. Duterte denied that first lady Liza Araneta-Marcos had something to do with her decision, saying the latter had nothing to do with her job. Araneta-Marcos earlier criticized Duterte for not coming to the President’s defense after her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, accused Mr. Marcos of using drugs. Her resignation from the Cabinet further backed speculations of a split between her and her former running mate in the 2022 national elections. Support sought Still, Duterte said she and the President had a discussion and that he asked her to help the administration’s candidates in the 2025 midterm elections. She added that she had a separate meeting with her father, who also made a similar request for candidates of his Partido Demokratiko Pilipino, The Vice President, however, said she did not commit to either one “because I need to think first about what would be my direction for the midterm elections next year.” During her speech at the turnover ceremony, Duterte told Angara, “Welcome to the chaos,” drawing laughter from him and the audience. She recalled some of the programs that began under her leadership in the DepEd, such as the launching of the new “Matatag” curriculum, the review of the senior high school curriculum, and the funding and launching of DepEd’s mental health program, among others. For his part, Angara said he would hit the ground running, “and we want to learn from all of you here as we go along.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. visited the office of the Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday for the first time since he assumed the highest office in the land last week. More than a week before his inauguration as the 17th president of the Philippines, Marcos announced he would take on the portfolio of secretary of agriculture, a move hugely welcomed by many agricultural groups nationwide. He said he intended to reorganize the agency and bolster the country’s food production. The president said certain offices in the DA were underutilized and have to be “retooled” for the post-pandemic era. Undertaking the reorganization, he said this would make the agency ready for the coming years. He would also strive to increase agricultural production and subsequently, counteract the increase in food prices. That way, he said the department would become “more responsive to the local situation” in terms of food supply. “The other priority which is equally important, although it is a long-term process, is the restructuring of the DA. As I have mentioned many times before, many of the agencies have changed their function over the years and maybe it’s time to return them,” Marcos said earlier. Absent at flag-raising As the new agriculture chief, Marcos was absent in the first flag-raising ceremony of the DA under his term. But as DA chief, he led the closed-door executive committee meeting at the Bureau of Soils and Water Management Convention Hall in Quezon City. Reporters were barred from roaming around the DA premises, taking photos or videos, and were asked to stay in the press office for the duration of the so-called closed-door meeting. Marcos pointed out that the first order of business for the department is to help the country tide through the global food crisis so that Filipino consumers can buy food items at affordable prices. “We have to attend to the impending food crisis that it seems it will be visiting us in the next two quarters,” he said. “We can increase our production of rice and corn at least. And hopefully, I don’t know if we have enough time to solve the problem of livestock and poultry sectors.” He likewise asked the agency to reassess the rice tariffication law and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership .

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) called on the national government to “keep an open mind” and reconsider its rejection of a UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) recommendation to pass a gender equality bill and other similar measures protecting the LGBTQ community. In a statement, the commission reminded Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla that several local governments have already promulgated ordinances protecting their constituents against discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. As such, his statements that the passage of a Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity and Expression (Sogie) bill was “not acceptable” in the Philippines as a predominantly Catholic country would not only “downplay” those efforts but further “embolden” discrimination against LGBTQ members in the name of religious beliefs. Last week, Remulla led the Philippine delegation to the country’s Universal Periodic Review (UPR) in Geneva, where 107 member states urged President Marcos’ administration to end the policy of Red-tagging and the climate of impunity against activists, rights workers and journalists. Most of the 289 recommendations made by the member states urged the Philippines to protect the interests of vulnerable and marginalized groups, such as women, children, indigenous folk and the LGBTQ. While the delegation accepted 200 of those recommendations, it rejected calls to push legislation on gender identity, same-sex marriage and divorce, citing religious grounds. ‘Silenced realities’ CHR Chair Richard Palpal-latoc said that while respect for other people’s beliefs was part of upholding other people’s rights, the Sogie bill and other similar proposals were part of the country’s obligations to ensure that every citizen is free from threats and harm and is treated equally. “We urge the Philippine government to reexamine this position, given that the 1987 Philippine Constitution mandates the State to value the dignity of every human person and thereby guarantee full respect for human rights (Article II, Section 11), as well as to provide to all persons the equal protection of laws (Article III, Section 1),” Palpal-latoc said. He added that the commission was willing to dialogue with the government to address misconceptions about the Sogie bill and related measures. For one, the present version of the Sogie bill does not contain any provision on same-sex civil unions and does not, contrary to the belief of certain sectors, “grant special privileges to the LGBTQ community,” the CHR chief noted. “In the end, the country will be judged and viewed through how it treats the weak, vulnerable, and marginalized. The challenge before the government is to serve and address the plight of the unseen and unheard, to recognize silenced realities, and live up to its commitment that will unconditionally uphold the inherent human rights, dignity, and worth of all regardless of their identity,” Palpal-latoc said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The appointment of health reform advocate Dr. Anthony Leachon as consultant of the Department of Health (DOH) has been downgraded to a “voluntary” status after a lawmaker questioned his new role in the government. On Friday, Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa said he had moved to revise the job contract of Leachon, who “reverted back to a volunteer consultant without pay.” “I’ve talked to Dr. Leachon and he said he’s willing to be a volunteer consultant ... so he’ll just help the government with whatever expertise he has,” Herbosa said. House Majority Leader Rep. Janette Garin has questioned the appointment of Leachon as a consultant for noncommunicable diseases, pointing out that his monthly salary was nearly P100,000, or equivalent to the pay grade of a DOH director. Garin, a former DOH chief, wondered why Herbosa named Leachon a consultant when there were career officials with a similar role in the health agency. Garin said the DOH should have instead tapped the current officers of medical societies, such as the Philippine College of Physicians and Philippine College of Cardiology. An internist and cardiologist who served as COVID-19 task force adviser during the Duterte administration, Leachon called the statements of Garin “personal destruction.” In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Thursday, Leachon said he “can work without compensation,” like when he was a “one-peso consultant” of then DOH chief Enrique Ona in 2012.

    "article_body": "An inspection conducted by the Bureau of Customs (BOC) in three warehouses in Tondo, Manila, led to the discovery of P400 million worth of suspected smuggled rice and other imported products. Customs Commissioner Bien Rubio said that of the total amount of the goods found in the warehouses, P90.2 million were from some 36,086 sacks of imported rice from Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. “While our government and kababayans scramble to make rice cheaper and more accessible, these businesses are possibly smuggling and hoarding them, which further adversely impacts our efforts to bring the prices down,” Rubio said in a statement. The other imported miscellaneous goods found include children’s toys, cosmetics, kitchenware, household wares, videoke machines, fabrics, cosmetics, pharmaceutical products, shoes and apparel. Agents of the Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service (CIIS)-Manila International Container Port and the Philippine Coast Guard implemented the letters of authority signed by Rubio against three warehouses located on Antonio Rivera and Dagupan streets in Tondo on Sept. 16. According to CIIS Director Verne Enciso, they received derogatory information about the facilities prior to the operation. Sen. Francis Escudero earlier said authorities should not stop at seizing rice found to be imported and sold illegally. He said the Customs must file appropriate cases against individuals allegedly facilitating the unlawful entry of rice and those hoarding the food staple. Import tariff cuts Meanwhile, discussions “at the highest level” in Malacañang are ongoing in relation to the proposed temporary reduction of import tariffs on milled rice even as farmers’ and agri-business groups are calling for the removal of key economic managers from the Cabinet. As soon as price caps on milled rice were announced through Executive Order No. 39, which was signed on Aug. 31, the Foundation for Economic Freedom called for a temporary lifting—to zero percent—or reduction to 10 percent from 35 percent of levies on imported rice. The think tank made this a formal petition on Sept. 6 and is now pending at the Tariff Commission. On Sept. 8, Department of Finance (DOF) Secretary Benjamin Diokno told journalists that the DOF was also proposing a temporary tariff cut—to zero or a maximum of 10 percent—while reiterating support for EO 39. On Monday, Sept. 18, Diokno said in a statement that this proposal was part of a comprehensive strategy to reduce prices for consumers and mitigate a potential shortage of the staple due to the impact of the ongoing El Niño climate phenomenon, which threatens agricultural output. “Rest assured that the DOF, in coordination with other relevant government agencies and stakeholders, shall pursue programs and support measures to balance the interests of domestic rice farmers,” Diokno said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health (DOH) on Tuesday said that it has disbursed a total of P76.1 billion as of March 19, 2024 for the health emergency allowance (HEA) of eligible public and private health workers in the country. According to the DOH, this amount covers 8,549,207 claims filed from July 1, 2021, to July 20, 2023. The health department explained that it had received P19.9 billion for HEA in the programmed appropriations of the 2024 national budget, of which P19.7 billion or 99 percent has already been distributed to eligible health facilities. The DOH, however, noted that an estimated P27 billion is still needed to settle its debt to health facilities. “ The DOH, through its Centers for Health Development in the regions, has been working with private and local government unit (LGU)-owned hospitals and health facilities. The law requires DOH to have Memorandums of Agreement (MOAs) and to wait for full liquidation by these LGU and private hospitals of HEA funds already paid, before subsequent releases of additional funds,” it said in a statement. The DOH is referring to Republic Act (RA) No. 11712, also known as the Public Health Emergency Benefits and Allowances for Health Care Workers Act, which mandates that health workers receive HEAs based on their risk exposure during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continuing its statement, the DOH further said that it is working “hand-in-hand” with the Department of Budget and Management to grant HEAs to all eligible health workers. “We are ready to release the funds as soon as the concerned private and LGU hospitals will comply with the law that requires liquidation,” it said. Under R.A. No. 11712, health workers who responded during a \"state of public health emergency\" shall be granted HEAs for every month of service, ranging from P3,000 for workers deployed in low-risk areas to P9,000 for those deployed in high-risk areas. The law also says that the HEA must be released monthly. However, health workers from public hospitals who responded during the COVID-19 pandemic are only now receiving their allowances, some two years after filing their claims. Meanwhile, those in private and LGU-owned hospitals are still waiting for their HEAs.",

New DICT Secretary Henry Aguda ordered the resignations through a memorandum issued March 31, or a week after he assumed the vital government portfolio. “In the exigency of service and in order to give the undersigned free hand to perform his duties and functions, all incumbent undersecretaries, assistant secretaries and directors of the DICT are hereby directed to tender their unqualified courtesy resignations,” the memorandum reads. Current officials Currently, Paul Mercado serves as undersecretary for special concerns; Heherson Asiddao, undersecretary for support services; Jeffrey Ian Dy, undersecretary for infostructure/management, cybersecurity and upskilling; David Almirol Jr., undersecretary for e-government; and Jocelle Batapa-Sigue, undersecretary for ICT industrial development. The assistant secretaries are Gerald James Reyes (planning and procurement), Maria Teresa Camba (regional development), Philip Varilla (infostructure management), Wilroy Ticzon (consumer protection), Edwin Ligo (management information systems service) and Renato Paraiso (legal affairs). The new DICT chief previously served as president of UnionDigital Bank. He was also board chair of City Savings Bank and UBX Philippines. Aguda was also engaged in the telecommunication and technology industries. Aguda replaced Ivan John Uy, who tendered his resignation this month after three years of service. Internet deal Last month, the DICT said it was in talks with a satellite internet company that can provide 200Mbps (megabit per second) of connectivity to 10,000 schools for P1.5 billion per year under a 10-year contract. This amount is P5 billion cheaper than the current contract price of P6.5 billion annually for only more than 7,000 locations. By the first half, the DICT is targeting to launch two more phases of the National Fiber Backbone (NFB) project, which seeks to improve connectivity in southern Luzon and certain parts of Visayas and Mindanao. The NFB phase 1 was fired up last year. It spans 1,245 kilometers from Laoag City, Ilocos Norte, to Quezon City, supporting 3,000 free Wi-Fi spots in Ilocos region, Central Luzon and Metro Manila.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Barely three months after it joined the government’s anticommunist task force, the Coordinating Council of Private Educational Associations (Cocopea), which has a membership of 1,500 private schools nationwide, announced its withdrawal from the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-Elcac) to “preserve the essentiality of academic freedom and the vital role it plays in a democratic society.” “It was an internal decision which was driven primarily by our setting of priorities in terms of our core advocacy which is education; and secondly, we wanted to preserve the independence of Cocopea as an NGO (nongovernmental organization) in engaging government on many issues, including academic freedom of our institutions,” Cocopea legal counsel Joseph Noel Estrada told the Inquirer in a text message on Monday. The NTF-Elcac itself had tapped the Cocopea to be one of its members, which was approved in November last year by President Marcos as task force chair. READ: The bitter truth about NTF-Elcac The task force said then that it was planning to conduct an “information awareness campaign” in private schools as a way to counter the “terror grooming of organizations like the [Communist Party of the Philippines, New People’s Army, and National Democratic Front].” Parlade accusation Cocopea’s inclusion in NTF-Elcac was widely criticized because of the task force’s propensity for Red-tagging, or linking activists and rights groups to the communist movement, prompting calls for its abolition. Before the formation of the task force, retired military Gen. Antonio Parlade Jr. launched a massive anticommunist campaign in 2018 as he accused 20 private universities and colleges of being “breeding grounds for communists” but without presenting evidence to back his claim. This particular incident was among those considered by Cocopea in its decision to formally withdraw its membership from NTF-Elcac, according to Estrada. “No attribution specifically to the task force, but certainly that time in 2018 when around 20 private universities and colleges were tagged as breeding grounds for communists without proper validation and this endangered the security of students and undermined the integrity of these educational institutions ...; [this] was considered in our decision,” he told the Inquirer. “Although there was still no NTF-Elcac then, we do not want to be placed in that situation again and not be able to speak out independently,” he added. In a statement on Sunday night, the Cocopea said it formally asked the President on Jan. 30 to withdraw its membership from the anticommunist task force. ‘Internal matter’ “After further consultation among its member associations, and upon review of its core advocacies, Cocopea has opted to strengthen its education initiatives by preserving its collaborative role outside of a formal membership in the NTF-Elcac,” the group added. But it stressed that it “remains one” with the task force, particularly in its “mission to achieve unity, peace, security and socioeconomic development.” The task force, for its part, said it respected the group’s decision, calling it an “internal matter.” —with a report from Frances Mangosing",

    "article_body": "To better align the basic curriculum with the demands and opportunities of the digital economy, the Department of Education (DepEd) is set to introduce the e-commerce track for senior high school students. The DepEd on Thursday signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and Thames International School Inc. to create the new track. READ: PH e-commerce market seen to expand by 15% this year Thames was tapped as a partner for being a “leading provider of business education” in the country, according to the DTI. ‘Big chance’ to get job The “specialized” e-commerce track will be piloted in 50 schools in three regions—Metro Manila, Central Luzon and Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon provinces)—and will cover around 1,000 students, according to Thames president and cofounder Jaime Noel Santos. Education Secretary Sonny Angara said they plan to include the new track in the school year 2024-2025, which just officially started on July 29. Speaking to reporters at the MOA signing in Makati City, Angara said President Marcos “will be delighted with this because he has been saying to me that we should be able to provide jobs for our senior high school graduates and there’s a big chance for them to secure a job.” “And that has been our promise ever since we passed the K to 12 [law], that they will be able to get jobs just by graduating from the Grade 12 level,” he added. Four current tracks Santos said the three pilot regions were chosen mainly because they currently have the highest concentration of e-commerce companies, where students taking the new track may be hired “immediately upon graduating.’’ Introducing e-commerce in the just-opened school year is still doable since students may still change tracks during the first term, Santos explained. A “train the trainer” program for teachers will soon be launched as part of the rollout, he added. The country’s senior high school education currently has four tracks: academic, arts and design, sports, and technical-vocational-livelihood. The academic track has four strands: accountancy, business and management (ABM); science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM); humanities and social science (HUMSS); and general academic strand (GAS). The Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (Tesda), the country’s main tech-voc training institution, offers courses in digital marketing and entrepreneurship. One of the Tesda programs in the field is iSTAR, an upgraded version of its Sari-Sari Store Training and Access Resources that provides free entrepreneurship training through blended learning. Gina Gonong, the education undersecretary for curriculum and teaching, said including the e-commerce track would be part of the ongoing review and revision of the senior high curriculum. “We can see that there’s potential [for it] to be a part of our senior high school curriculum, which is still currently undergoing review and redevelopment,” Gonong told reporters.",

Romeo Brawner Jr., commanding general of the Philippine Army, as the next Armed Forces of the Philippines chief of staff, replacing Gen. Andres Centino. Centino, the only officer to have been named military chief twice, will continue to serve the president as presidential adviser on the West Philippine Sea. Brawner, who also attended the University of the Philippines in 1984, graduated second in the 1989 “Makatao” Class of the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) and has served the military in various capacities over the past 34 years. He has been company commander of the 6th Special Forces Company, battalion commander of the 2nd Special Forces Battalion, operations officer of the airborne Special Forces Regiment, chief of staff of the 6th Infantry Division, public affairs chief of the Army; AFP spokesperson and commander of the civil-military operations regiment. He was one of the key commanders of Task Force Ranao during the five-month terrorist siege of Marawi City in Lanao del Sur in 2017 and was promoted to chief of the Mindanao-based 103rd Infantry Brigade the following year. Brawner also holds graduate degrees from Ateneo de Manila University, the Asian Institute of Management, the European School of Management at Oxford University, and the US Army War College. Presidential Communications Secretary Cheloy Velicaria Garafil said Brawner also previously served as the commandant of cadets in the PMA, “where he played an important role in the total eradication of hazing and maltreatment in the cadet corps.” Garafil said Brawner also served as commander of the 4th Infantry “Diamond” Division, where he supervised the unit’s combat operations that resulted in “the decisive neutralization of Jorge Madlos, or ‘Ka Oris,’” a top commander of the communist New People’s Army.

    "article_body": "The Department of Agriculture (DA) expects substantial losses in rice production this year due to bad weather throughout the country, an official said on Friday. “We can expect that our losses will be somewhat significant this year compared to last year due to fewer typhoons that entered the country in 2023 and their impact on the agriculture production,” Assistant Agriculture Secretary Arnel de Mesa said in a Zoom interview. De Mesa, also the spokesperson for the DA, said the damage to rice already reached more than 500,000 metric tons (MT) even before the onslaught of Severe Tropical Storm “Kristine” (international name: Trami). This week, the DA announced it revised its palay output projection for 2024 to 19.41 million MT, down by 3.1 percent from the previous estimate of 20.04 million MT. If the estimate is attained, the forecast output would be 3.2 percent lower than the record high of 20.06 million MT achieved in 2023. Kristine is the latest weather disturbance that ravaged some parts of the country this year. Based on the DA’s bulletin posted on Thursday afternoon, the farm sector sustained P80.80 million in damage. Kristine hits 2,864 farmers The storm took a toll on the livelihood of 2,864 farmers in the regions of Cordillera, Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon, Palawan), Bicol and Western Visayas. The volume of production loss is estimated at 5,287 MT covering 1,570 hectares of agricultural land. Rice accounted for 98.20 percent of the overall damage, valued at P79.34 million, mostly in reproductive and maturity stages. Corn, high-value crops and livestock and poultry also incurred losses. “As field assessments continue, further damage and losses are anticipated, potentially impacting additional commodities,” the DA said. De Mesa said Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. has instructed the DA’s regional offices, Agricultural Credit Policy Council, the Philippine Crop Insurance Corp. and other concerned offices to expedite the release of assistance to affected farmers and fishers. P1-B fund sought He also said the DA requested an additional P1 billion from the Department of Budget and Management to aid rehabilitation efforts in affected areas. They expect its release in November. The agency has so far prepared the distribution of P80.21 million worth of agricultural inputs, such as rice, corn and vegetable seeds, drugs and biologics for livestock. Prior to Kristine, the DA reported that around 70 percent of the area planted to rice during this wet season had already been harvested. “We have enough stocks [of agricultural products],” Tiu Laurel told a situational briefing with President Marcos held on Friday. But De Mesa said vegetable prices could still increase by 10 to 15 percent depending on the impact of the storm. I",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Typhoon Egay (international name: Doksuri), which ravaged parts of Luzon and Visayas in less than a week, wiped out P1.3 billion worth of agricultural products, the Department of Agriculture (DA) said on Saturday. In its latest bulletin, the DA said the typhoon took a heavy toll on the livelihood of 91,268 farmers and fisherfolk in the affected areas. The volume of production loss was placed at 62,259 metric tons spanning 98,969 hectares of agricultural lands. “The increase is due to the updated reports from Cordillera Administrative Region, Ilocos Region, Cagayan Valley, Western Visayas, and Central Luzon,” it said. Egay destroyed rice, corn, high-value crops, livestock, and poultry as well as agricultural facilities and fishing paraphernalia. Corn accounted for 47.5 percent of the total with P648.2 million, hitting 38,401 metric tons of produce in 58,497 hectares of land. Rice followed with P486.8 million, equivalent to a share of 35.7 percent, and high-value crops with P182.4 million (13.3 percent). Agricultural infrastructures sustained P20.8 million in damage, fisheries P14.1 million, and livestock and poultry P11.9 million. Egay’s impact on the farm sector as of this writing was inching closer to the P1.3 billion damage brought about by the low-pressure area, Intertropical Convergence Zone, shear line, and northeast monsoon (amihan) early this year. Won’t affect prices Despite the escalating losses due to the typhoon, the DA earlier said Egay won’t affect retail prices and supply of food items since the planted crops were in the early growth stage. To date, the price of a kilogram of local commercial rice ranged from P37 to P60 as of Friday against last year’s P38 to P50, based on the DA’s price monitoring. Imported rice retailed from P42 to P58 per kg compared to P38 to P50 per kg. However, imported regular milled rice is not available. Milkfish (bangus) is being sold from P140 to P240 per kg compared to P160 per kg a year ago. Tilapia is priced from P105 to P160 per kg from only P120 per kg previously. Local round scad (galunggong) is sold from P220 to P260 per kg, almost the same as P240 per kg last year. Imported round scad, available only in Guadalupe Market, is priced at P200 per kg. Indian mackerel (alumahan) is not available. Bittergourd (ampalaya) is priced from P90 to P140 per kg from only P80 per kg a year ago while the price of eggplant reached P70 to P120 per kg from P90 per kg last year. Cabbage ranged from P100 to P160 per kg compared to only P60 per kg the previous year.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Deputy Majority Leader Francisco Paolo Ortega V on Thursday said apparent “relatives” of Mary Grace Piattos along with a mobile phone brand namesake were among the supposed recipients of confidential funds in his review of evidence in the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte. READ: ‘Mary Grace Piattos’ does not exist, PSA confirms In a statement on Thursday, the administration lawmaker said a perusal of the Office of the Vice President’s (OVP) acknowledgment receipts for its P500-million confidential fund spending from December 2022 to September 2023 showed there were more names that were obviously made up apart from Piattos. READ: House panel to PSA: Verify 1,992 names linked to OVP fund issue The La Union representative vowed to continue reviewing the documents attached to the impeachment complaint transmitted to the Senate to uncover more members of what he described as the “Budol (Scam) Gang.” According to Ortega, he found two names—Pia Piatos-Lim and Renan Piatos—which could be related to Piattos, except the last names were spelled with only one T. He also cited a Xiaome Ocho, which was seemingly taken from a Xiaomi mobile phone 2018 model, the Xiaomi Mi 8. Submitted for validation Piattos and the three other names were among 1,992 names submitted for validation to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) by the House of Representatives’ committee on good government. The PSA found that out of the 1,992 names of supposed OVP confidential fund recipients, 1,322 had no birth records, including Piattos, Piatos-Lim, Piatos, and Ocho. Among such names in the OVP’s acknowledgment receipts with no PSA birth, marital, or death records were Kokoy Villamin; May Pamana; Dodong S Barok; Dan Rick and Alan Rick Otso; Glaiza Ranger; Jay Kamote; Roman, Rome, and Romeo Felicidad; and Miggy Mango. “We thought only one name sounded absurd in the list of confidential fund recipients, but it seems there’s a whole family of ‘Piattos’ and a cell phone model included,” Ortega said in Filipino. “You’ll be torn between laughing and getting furious when you see ‘Xiaome Ocho’ on the list,” Ortega said, referring to a 2018 cell phone model as a supposed confidential fund recipient. “This ‘Budol Gang’ is getting out of hand. First, we have the Piattos family, and now even a cell phone?” he added. Probe continues Piattos, whose existence was initially questioned by Antipolo City Rep. Romeo Acop, supposedly received on Dec. 30, 2022, P70,000 as payment of reward in the form of “medicines.” The name has since become symbolic of the OVP’s questionable use of its confidential funds. The P70,000 purportedly received by Piattos was part of the OVP’s P125-million confidential funds, which were reportedly spent in just 11 days of December 2022 for the following: the payment of rewards; the purchase of information, food, medicine, goods, and equipment; and the rental of safe houses and vehicles. According to Ortega, Duterte needs to explain where the confidential funds went, given that apparently fabricated names were used as their supposed recipients. “She needs to explain who exactly makes up this ‘Budol Gang’ when she presents her defense at the impeachment trial,” he said. “We will continue reviewing the documents attached to the impeachment complaint to expose more members of this ‘Budol Gang,’” Ortega said. “The public deserves the truth. We shouldn’t pretend that a scam of this magnitude involving confidential funds didn’t happen.”",

    "article_body": "The Association of Licensed Manning Agencies (Alma) Maritime Group has called on the Department of Labor and Employment (Dole) to exercise political will to address the exploitation of seafarer compensation system by ambulance chasing lawyers. The group of 71 manning agencies deploying around 174,000 Filipino seafarers at any given time has warned that unchecked ambulance chasing for money claims has become the biggest threat to the employability of potentially 400,000 seafarers, both officers and [non-officer] ratings. Maritime industry stakeholders said unfair money claims decisions pushed by ambulance chasing lawyers who solicit seafarer-clients in exchange for a huge cut in the monetary award, had been the main reason for the decline in the market share of Filipino seafarers in international vessels—from 45 percent in 1995 to 14 percent by 2015. Cases filed by seafarers for money claims against shipowner-employers for work-related injury, illness or death are decided by labor arbiters of the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC) and National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB). Alma Maritime Group chairperson Iris Baguilat, who is president of Dohle Seafront Crewing manning agency, said shipowners were forced to settle “under duress” since 99 percent of the claims were awarded by the NCMB. “Dole should ensure that only quality decisions backed by actual evidence should be rendered by the NLRC and the NCMB and ensure that the Philippines establishes a reputation for fair and unbiased legal system,” Baguilat said. ‘Willing to sit down’ When reached for comment, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said he was willing to sit down with manning agencies to discuss their concerns, but in coordination with the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) under Secretary Susan Ople. “Since the attached agencies mentioned [NLRC and NCMB] are attached to the Dole, we will be open and willing to sit down with Alma to get details and discuss the matters with them so we can address and resolve their concerns,” Laguesma replied via text message. “We will do it in coordination with DMW since seafarers are principally their constituencies,” he added. NLRC public information officer in charge Purdey Perez said “there is no immediate and direct connection between the valid claims of seafarers and the loss of their employability.” “The seafarers should not be blamed for the loss of their employability just because they have a valid claim, unless shown that the seafarer is in conspiracy with the ambulance chaser in filing a false claim,” he said when reached for comment.On the average, he said, 65 to 70 percent of compensation claims cases are won by seafarer-claimants. “The NLRC always weighs the evidence presented by both parties to determine the claims,” Perez said. Asked for the NLRC’s safeguards against ambulance chasing, Perez said the NLRC limits the people allowed to appear in hearings. INQ",

    "article_body": "The families of drug war victims still hope they can get justice from the country’s judicial system, but like the International Criminal Court (ICC), they do not see the willingness to prosecute the masterminds. Lawyer Kristina Conti, who brought the first complaints to the ICC in 2017, said the families she represents were encouraged by the progress of moves in the House of Representatives to cooperate with the ICC in its investigation of former President Rodrigo Duterte’s war on illegal drugs. “[The families of the victims of the drug war] are very excited [about these new talks] and any positive development is very exciting to them,” Conti told the Inquirer on Thursday. “In fact, the mothers are very hopeful in the courts,” Conti clarified. “But they are daunted by the usual and systemic issues of the legal system: its sluggishness, issues of access to justice, language barriers.” She noted that both the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Philippine National Police have not even contacted the victims’ families about the cases of their slain loved ones. The lack of follow-through only emphasized that the country’s courts “were not the problem, it’s the unwillingness, incompetence and conscious coverup that has made it exceedingly difficult,” she said. While the PNP admitted that there were more than 6,000 killings that occurred in drug operations during the Duterte administration, the DOJ only investigated 56 cases that were “prosecutable.” But prosecutors only secured the convictions of four Caloocan City policemen in the killings of 17-year-old Kian delos Santos, 18-year-old Carl Arnaiz, and 11-year-old Reynaldo de Guzman. Still, Duterte’s allies argue that the ICC has no jurisdiction to investigate the charges of crimes against humanity that face the former President. On Wednesday, Senator Bong Go, Duterte’s personal aide for decades before he was elected during the Duterte administration, insisted that the ICC can only acquire jurisdiction if there is no working judicial system. “ICC has no right to meddle in our internal affairs where our courts remain fully operational,” Go said in Candijay, Bohol. “I believe in our judicial system.” “This is not very encouraging,” former Bayan Muna Rep. Neri Colmenares told the House of Representatives on Wednesday. “Since 2016 until 2023, the DOJ cannot even give a straight answer” on how many were actually killed under the drug war and how many police were prosecuted because of it. It’s also why, out of the hundreds of families under the care of Rise Up for Life and for Rights, the organization that asked the ICC to investigate Duterte’s drug war, only one case ever went to trial. For human rights lawyer Chel Diokno, the buck stops with President Marcos. “I do think that if the President will rejoin, we will have no problems in being welcomed back by the ICC.” Speaking on the sidelines of the annual honoring of martyrs and heroes at Bantayog ng mga Bayani on Thursday, Diokno said “the President is the chief architect of foreign policy.” “But I believe that he should also be advised by the government counsel because this is a matter of a treaty obligation,” he said. “I hope he listens to the lawyers and I hope the lawyers give him good advice.” READ: Who ‘benefitted’ from drug war deaths? ‘Filipinos, not me,’ says Duterte",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Office of the Ombudsman has directed Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and four other government officials to answer the complaint filed against them by the Senate committee on foreign relations headed by Sen. Imee Marcos over the March 11 arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte and his turnover to the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. According to two separate orders issued by the Ombudsman on Tuesday, Remulla and his brother, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, along with Philippine National Police Chief Gen. Rommel Marbil, PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief Nicolas Torre III, and Special Envoy for Transnational Crimes Markus Lacanilao, were directed to submit their counteraffidavits within 10 days, along with their witnesses’ affidavits. READ: Imee Marcos to Ombudsman: Probe gov’t execs who gave Duterte to ICC “Failure to file counteraffidavit within the aforesaid period shall be deemed as waiver of respondents’ right to submit controverting evidence and the preliminary investigation shall proceed accordingly,” the Ombudsman said. The orders signed by Director Nellie Boguen-Golez of the Ombudsman’s Preliminary Investigation and Administrative Adjudication Bureau were in response to the recommendations of the Senate committee, which looked into Duterte’s arrest. Possible violations In the committee report transmitted by Marcos to the Ombudsman on Friday, she asked the antigraft body to investigate the five officials for possible violations of the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act on top of administrative offenses. According to Marcos, Remulla should be probed for antigraft law violations and usurpation of judicial functions for supposedly causing an invalid arrest. Jonvic Remulla, on the other hand, should be held liable also for antigraft law violations, she said. Torre, who read the Miranda rights to Duterte and explained that he was “deputized” to implement the ICC arrest warrant, should face charges of arbitrary detention and grave threats, according to Marcos. As for Marbil, the senator recommended that he be charged with arbitrary detention while Lacanilao be held liable for usurpation of authority or official functions, false testimony in other cases, and perjury under the Revised Penal Code. Marcos said all five officials should also face administrative offenses, namely, grave misconduct and conduct prejudicial to the best interest of the service, for their supposed roles in the arrest of Duterte. The former president is currently detained at the ICC prison facility in The Hague after the tribunal’s Pre-Trial Chamber 1 found sufficient basis to accuse him of being an “indirect coperpetrator,” or a mastermind, in the drug war killings that happened while he served as Davao City mayor and during his presidency.",

The office of the schools division superintendent in Metro Manila, in a statement, identified Bonifacio Caculitan Jr. as the school head of Pugad Lawin High School accused of molesting Grade 10 students. Carleen Sedilla, the schools division superintendent, said Caculitan was arrested on the morning of Sept. 29 and is jailed at a Quezon City police station for lascivious conduct, a violation under Section 5(b) of Republic Act No. 7610, or the Special Protection of Children Against Abuse, Exploitation and Discrimination Act. “On the same day, the schools division office has also submitted the intake sheet and requested an authority to investigate for the administrative aspect of the case,” she said. Caculitan remains in detention while waiting for his bail to be processed, Sedilla said. The case had also been reported to the city social welfare office for the conduct of psychosocial assistance to the students, she said. Counseling sessions would also be provided to the parents and other students. From an Inquirer report on Aug. 6, 2012, Caculitan was awarded by the Metrobank Foundation as one of its “Most Outstanding Teachers.” At the time, he was affiliated with Ernesto Rondon High School, formerly Project 6 High School.

    "article_body": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. returned to Manila on Thursday night after a state visit to Kuala Lumpur, bringing home $285 million worth of investment pledges from Malaysian businessmen. The Malaysian investors were interested in the fields of food processing, multiservice digital platforms, aviation, aviation maintenance support services, logistics, manufacturing, infrastructure, water and wastewater treatment projects. “The investments that we have agreed on so far will inject a total of about $285 million, serving as a robust and affirmative indication of the ongoing trust and keen interest of businesses and investors in the Philippines,” the President said after a meeting with Malaysian business leaders on Wednesday evening. During the meeting, the Chief Executive emphasized that the Philippines has shown healthy signs of economic recovery amid the global challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. He noted that the economy posted 7.6 percent growth last year, one of the best-performing economies in the Asia-Pacific Region. ‘Grow out of that debt’ “For the first quarter of this year, the Philippines outperformed its peers in the region by posting the GDP (gross domestic product) growth of 6.4 percent; that is the first quarter, which is within the country’s 6 to 7 percent target for the year,” Mr. Marcos said. “The reason that we put such emphasis on the growth figures is that as all the countries have gone into debt, a higher rate of debt-to-GDP because of the pandemic and the costs of the pandemic response for all the countries. It is our fundamental theory that we should grow out of that debt,” he added. Mr. Marcos said his administration continues to seek ways to improve the foreign investment climate.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. would continue his predecessor’s controversial drug war, according to Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos, although he refused to give a direct answer when asked if it would be just as bloody. “The war against drugs will be as intensive as before on the basis of my oath as a public official in accordance with the Constitution,” Abalos said in his first press conference as head of the Department of the Interior and Local Government on Monday. To the question of whether the campaign would be as bloody as the one waged by former President Rodrigo Duterte, he merely said: “The drug war will be pursued relentlessly in accordance with the oaths I would be taking and on the basis of the Constitution.” About three people were killed daily by authorities in legitimate antidrug operations during Duterte’s term, based on the latest government-released figures. From July 1, 2016, to May 31 this year, or a period spanning 2,160 days, a total of 6,252 persons were killed in such operations. Much higher figure Local and international human rights groups, however, reported a much higher figure — as much as 30,000 by 2019 — if drug suspects killed by unidentified gunmen and vigilantes were included in the tally. Abalos said he would push for fewer drug case dismissals and give more support to antinarcotics police officers. According to him, a major problem he saw in the drug campaign was the dismissal of drug cases at the level of prosecutors and courts due to “technicalities.” The Department of Justice (DOJ) reported that from 2016 to 2017, close to 60 percent of drug cases were either dismissed or resulted in the acquittal of respondents because of weak case buildups, or over the police’s failure to comply with rules on the custody and disposition of seized drugs. Lack of witnesses Under Section 21 of the Comprehensive and Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002, the inventory of the seized drugs should be done in the presence of a representative from the media or the DOJ, and any elected public official, usually from the barangay. “What happens is the cases are dismissed due to the lack of witnesses,” Abalos said. To remedy this problem, he said he would ask local government officials to always assign a person to testify in such cases to meet the requirements set by the law.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Monday said the extradition of televangelist Apollo Quiboloy, if requested by the United States government, may take time. “A lot will still happen,” he told reporters when asked if the United States had already sought the extradition of the executive pastor and leader of the Davao City-based Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) religious sect. “They still have to file the necessary cases. Maybe they started with the freezing of [his] assets first. So we’ll just wait and see,” he also said. The US Department of the Treasury sanctioned Quiboloy on Friday over allegations of serious human rights abuses. The department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control accused the pastor of “systemic and pervasive rape of girls [and] other physical abuse” and froze his assets and those of KOJC. The sanctions are different from the criminal cases Quiboloy is facing in the United States, although both are based on the same allegations. Remulla still noted that “we have a treaty with the [US government], we have an extradition treaty and we have to abide by the terms of conditions of our agreements with our friends from abroad.” “We’re waiting by the sidelines what would be their action. We’re looking at the cases to be filed. We’re waiting for things to happen on our end,” he added. ‘Swift action’ Meanwhile, the head of a think tank called for “swift action” from the government in coordinating with US authorities to prosecute Quiboloy’s case. “Anything less will put... President [Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] in a difficult situation before the international community, particularly as he serves as the Asean (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) coordinator to the European Union, which has very clear commitments relating to human rights and social justice,” Infrawatch PH convener Terry Ridon said in a statement on Monday. He emphasized that it would be difficult to encourage foreign investments into the country “while an international fugitive takes refuge within our shores.” The US chapter of women’s group Gabriela said Quiboloy should be immediately arrested because of the seriousness of the charges against him. The group welcomed the “positive development[s]” in the United States against Quiboloy, but said he should also be held accountable for Red-tagging Gabriela and other organizations. —WITH A REPORT FROM JANE BAUTISTA RELATED STORIES DOJ to study Quiboloy case, but lawmaker urges decisive action Solon says US Treasury sanctions should prompt local probe on Quiboloy Badoy’s take: Quiboloy woes a ‘price to pay’ for fighting Reds",

    "article_body": "WASHINGTON, DC, United States — The government may reimpose the mandatory wearing of face masks in view of the increase in COVID-19 infections since March, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Sunday. “We might have to think about it if it’s really [necessary],” the President told reporters during his flight to Washington for his official visit to the United States. “Although the rate of increase is growing, the baseline of where it started is just low, so hopefully we’re still going to be able to [control] it,” he said. He also said the government may have to carry out another vaccination drive targeting the younger population. Marcos said the dry season may be affecting people’s immune systems. “That will make them more vulnerable to COVID-19 again,” he said. “So we’ll look at it.... I hope we don’t have to [require face masks again], but we might. But I hope not.” The president said he would wait for the recommendation of the Department of Health (DOH) and the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF). In September last year, Marcos scrapped the mandatory use of face masks outdoors upon the IATF’s recommendation. The next month, he allowed the voluntary use of face masks indoors except in public transportation and health facilities. With these directives, the president said he was aiming to further open up the economy after two years of pandemic restrictions. Positivity rate This year, COVID-19 infections have been rising since March — the biggest increase being the 311 cases recorded on March 24 from 137 recorded the previous day. The last time coronavirus cases breached the 300 level was the 399 cases reported on Jan. 22. During Holy Week, the daily average number of new cases climbed to 278 from the previous week’s 246 cases, then further rose to 341 on the week of April 9. Also that week, the positivity rate in Metro Manila and 13 provinces breached the 5-percent threshold recommended by the World Health Organization to indicate that virus transmission is under control. Hospital bed utilization Average daily new infections increased higher to 450 cases in the week of April 16. Yet despite that upward trend, the DOH reported that hospital bed utilization was still lower than the low-risk threshold of 20 percent. Of the country’s 82 provinces, 56 remained under alert level 1, the lowest in the IATF’s five-level alert category, while the 26 other provinces have remained under alert level 2 since June last year due to their low vaccination rates. The DOH did not release its weekly COVID-19 bulletin on Monday — which would have provided data on the coronavirus situation as of April 23—as it cited “technical difficulties in the data migration process of our technical offices.” In an advisory on Monday night, the department said it would release the bulletin on Tuesday morning. —WITH A REPORT FROM DONA Z.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has turned over the first batch of mobile clinics or vehicles equipped with top-notch diagnostic and laboratory equipment to 28 provinces in Mindanao, in fulfillment of the government’s promise to deliver quality health care to the provinces, especially in remote areas. In his speech at the Manila North Harbor on Friday morning, Mr. Marcos said the deployment of mobile clinics for each of the country’s provinces is part of the government’s “innovative and flexible” approach in bringing primary health care closer to geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas. “There are many things we need to do to fix the health-care system in our country but our goal is clear: each Filipino should feel that the health-care system is working. Providing healthcare services to all is a challenge that needs coordination and strong leadership at every level of the government,” the President said. He also took to social media to announce the deployment of the first batch of 28 out of 83 mobile clinics to ensure “that every Filipino, no matter where they are, can now receive the care they deserve.” “As we send off the first batch of Bagong Pilipinas Mobile Clinics bound for Mindanao, we fulfill our promise to deliver quality health care to every province in the country,” he said. The President lamented that some Filipinos living in far-flung areas of the country have to make a long trip to the hospital just to get themselves examined by a physician. “They have to ride a boat, walk for hours and pray that they will arrive at the hospital safely. The distance is not their lone enemy, but the long hours, exhaustion, hunger, anxiety and the costs of health care,” Mr. Marcos said. He said the local government of each province can easily deploy their mobile clinic on medical missions where Filipinos in need of medical attention can consult a physician and just wait for their test results at the mobile clinic itself, without having to go to a hospital. The mobile clinic will also allow Filipinos to have their own medical records that can be used for reference every time they get themselves checked at the mobile clinic or at government-owned hospitals.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Immigration Commissioner Norman Tansingco has placed under his direct supervision a unit within the agency tasked to address illegal recruitment and human trafficking issues. Tansingco ordered last week the reorganization of the agency’s Travel Control and Enforcement Unit (TCEU), which used to be under the Intelligence Division. According to the Bureau of Immigration (BI), elevating TCEU under the Office of the Commissioner “will ensure direct supervision of the Commissioner to the section tasked to intercept human trafficking and illegal recruitment victims at the borders.” “[T]here will be increased oversight and direct coordination in addressing trafficking issues, ultimately leading to better protection for departing Filipinos,” it added. The TCEU was likewise renamed as the Immigration Protection and Border Enforcement Section (I-PROBES), stressing its role in protecting departing Filipinos from trafficking. “The I-PROBES will continue to strictly adhere to the Department of Justice guidelines on departure formalities, ensuring that all necessary precautions are taken to safeguard potential victims,” Tansingco said. He added that the unit was also ordered to report to the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking any individual found to be facilitating the departure of trafficked Filipinos. “We remain steadfast in our resolve to ensure that every measure is taken to protect our fellow Filipinos from falling prey to trafficking networks.” The BI stressed that, as a result of its dedicated efforts, the Philippines has retained its prestigious Tier 1 ranking in the United States’ Trafficking in Persons report for an impressive 8th consecutive year. “This achievement highlights the nation’s commitment to eradicating human trafficking and protecting its citizens from exploitation,” it added. Tansingco earlier called on local law enforcement agencies to tighten security around the country’s airports to fight human trafficking.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The recent signing of laws aimed at strengthening the Charter and expanding course offerings in four state universities will improve quality education for its learners, Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva said on Tuesday. These four measures that President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. signed recently are as follows: Republic Act (RA) 11980 or the Revised Bulacan State University (BulSU) Charter RA 11978 or the Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University-South La Union Campus-College of Medicine RA 11977 or the Establishment of the Pampanga State Agricultural University (PSAU) Floridablanca Campus RA 11979 that converts the Polytechnic University of the Philippines (PUP) in Parañaque City into a regular campus “We are optimistic that with the revised charter of the state universities, we can improve outcomes and advance educational opportunities for our learners,” Villanueva said in a statement. Under Republic Act (RA) 11980 or the Revised BulSU Charter, the university will expand its curricular offerings by further advancing graduate and undergraduate courses within its area of specialization, such as accountancy, engineering and technology, and arts and sciences, among others. BulSU is also set to “encourage the specialization of its constituent units” and is allowed to open new branches or extension campuses and enter into joint ventures with businesses and industries “for the development of economic assets.” Furthermore, RA 11978 will allow for the establishment of a school of medicine in DMMMSU-South La Union Campus which will consist of basic science and clinical courses “to develop a corps of professional physicians” and reinforce the country’s healthcare system while responding to the human resource development needs in La Union and Ilocos region. Meanwhile, PSAU-Floridablanca Campus is allowed under RA 11977 to offer short-term, technical-vocational, undergraduate, and graduate courses within its area of specialization, similar to the mandate of RA 11979 for PUP-Parañaque which was also converted to a regular campus under the law. Villanueva concluded that through these newly enacted laws, they hope to prepare the learners and graduates of the participating universities for lifelong learning and secure employment while also “[uplifting] the quality of education in the country and [bringing] it in line with global standards.” ( Barbara Gutierrez, INQUIRER.net intern)",

    "article_body": "Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan on Thursday said he would recommend to President Marcos the permanent ban on Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos) in the Philippines. “Personally, yes, if I’m asked,” Balisacan told reporters in Malacañang. He said at a Palace briefing that “the social costs are quite high” compared to the revenues the government has been receiving from Pogos. “The costs, especially social costs, are quite high, and we don’t think that the benefits in terms of the revenues generated and the impact on the economy are worth the cost,” Balisacan said when asked about the position of the National Economic Development Authority (Neda) on the 120-page Senate report recommending the permanent ban of Pogos in the country. Replacement “I think that what we want to encourage are very legitimate investments, good quality investments,” he added. According to Balisacan, the government wanted investments that would produce goods and services and “not ones that promote negative externalities to society, such as those alleged crimes and related issues.” Illegal Pogos have been linked to the spate of kidnappings of Chinese nationals, prostitution and money laundering in the Philippines. “We want investment inflows that will promote not only the economic but also the social aspects of our development,” Balisacan pointed out. He said he was optimistic that the revenue losses from the expulsion of Pogos in the country would be replaced by new investments. “Look at Thailand, look at Indonesia, look at all these other countries around us, they don’t depend on those kinds of businesses,” Balisacan said. Marcos in no rush Citing data from the Philippine National Police, the Senate report said 99 Pogo-related criminal activities had been recorded from January 2017 to Sept. 30, 2022, with 30 cases of kidnap-for-ransom, 13 cases of cybercrimes, 12 cases of human trafficking and 10 cases of serious illegal detention. In January this year, Marcos said he was in no rush to ban Pogos as suggested by some sectors. “It depends what the purpose is of banning them or removing them, because the problem in reference to Pogos, the problems come from the illegal ones, not the legal ones,” he told reporters while attending the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. But he admitted that the social cost of allowing Pogos in the country “might not be worth what they’re paying in taxes anymore.” Since then, Marcos has not made any public pronouncement about his position on Pogos. g/",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — After the Department of Transportation (DOTr) earlier warned airline companies against tampering with the passports of their passengers, the private operator of Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) has also ordered its security personnel to keep their hands off the travel documents of people seeking entry to any of its terminals. “To better protect your travel documents and reduce unnecessary contact, all Naia security personnel have been instructed not to touch passports during terminal entry and security verification,” the New Naia Infra Corp. (NNIC) said in an advisory on Tuesday. “Passengers will simply be asked to show their valid ID or travel document by holding it up themselves,” it added. READ: DOTr: Sanctions await airlines in ‘punit passport’ The DOTr and the Civil Aeronautics Board are investigating alleged cases of the “punit passport” scheme in some airports, with victims claiming their passports were deliberately tampered with or torn. As a result, they were not allowed to board their flights for abroad. No mishandling One of the supposed cases was reported by a woman on social media who said her 78-year-old father was not allowed by Cebu Pacific to board the flight bound for Bali, Indonesia, on April 15, after personnel of the budget carrier at Naia Terminal 3 discovered a small tear on his passport. The NNIC confirmed that the incident happened at an airline check-in counter at Naia 3, but said that “there has been no report of any mishandling involving Naia security personnel.” According to the DoTr, Indonesian immigration authorities in Denpasar, Bali, confirmed that the passport of the passenger involved was deemed “damaged and [they] would not have accepted [it] upon the passenger’s arrival.” They added that if he been allowed to board the flight, he would have been denied entry to Indonesia. Proactive measures “As the airport operator, and in the spirit of teamwork with all stakeholders, we continue to take proactive measures to ensure the safety and security of all passengers,” the NNIC said. “We are working closely with our airline partners, the DOTr and the Bureau of Immigration to strengthen procedures and make sure incidents like these do not happen again,” it added. Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon earlier said that airline firms and their personnel who are found to have deliberately tampered with the passports of passengers would face sanctions. The DoTr at the same time reminded passengers leaving the country to always check the validity and condition of their passport before traveling, and to consult with passport centers or airport authorities when in doubt.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — All 700 guards of the New Bilibid Prison’s (NBP) maximum security compound were sacked and replaced on Wednesday as Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) Director General Gregorio Catapang Jr. started the internal cleansing among its personnel as part of his reform agenda for the bureau long besieged by controversies. Catapang also relieved Corrections Chief Insp. Lucio Guevarra, the superintendent of the NBP maximum security compound, and replaced him with Corrections Senior Insp. Purificacion Hari, the first woman to head the compound in recent history. Hari will oversee more than 18,200 inmates, mostly convicted of heinous crimes including murder, kidnapping and drug trading, in the BuCor’s most secure facility located in Muntinlupa City. According to Catapang, he had long sought to replace the guards at NBP’s maximum security compound, noting that some of them committed “outright” violations of BuCor rules and regulations. Some were caught tampering with the CCTV cameras to avoid being observed by their superiors. Others were also reported to have hid the money they received as bribes in their locker rooms. There were also BuCor personnel who committed dishonesty in their attendance, asking someone to sign on their behalf, while some “30 or 50” personnel were found lounging in the agro-industrial park in NBP’s minimum security compound. “I ask for your cooperation because I have to reform BuCor. [But] up to now, I am not seeing any improvement on the manner on how you handle [NBP] maximum security compound. I still receive information of misdemeanors [among you],” he told BuCor personnel in a speech. Catapang was named to head the BuCor in October last year after its former chief, Gerald Bantag, was suspended. His appointment as BuCor director general was only made permanent by President Marcos on March 23. The 700 BuCor guards will be replaced by 300 new corrections officers and 35 more senior officers from the Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm in Palawan province. The 35 BuCor officers from Iwahig would guide the rookie guards, with Catapang vouching for them as “tried and tested” and “having no bad records.”According to Catapang, the 335 BuCor officers will be enough to maintain peace and order at NBP’s maximum security, with some of them equipped with body cameras. The relieved prison guards will undergo a monthlong refresher training starting next week under prison expert and US criminology professor Raymund Narag. They will then be transferred to other BuCor facilities, which are also lacking in manpower. As of the latest data, there are only 5,156 BuCor officers for the 50,686 inmates under BuCor’s care. As part of his reforms, Catapang said he would ban lockers in stations, as well as pockets in uniforms to prevent BuCor personnel from receiving bribes. Cell phones will also be banned permanently at NBP, with the new guards to communicate through official BuCor communication channels. “We are on a reform mode and we are to reform our institution within five years. But there will be a lot of changes that will be happening here,” Catapang said.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Newly installed Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin Jr. on Tuesday ordered a major revamp that affected at least 70 officials, including his second and third in command, and several other high-ranking generals holding regional and provincial posts. Some considered the movements a demotion, particularly in the case of Lt. Gen. Rhodel Sermonia. From being the deputy chief for administration, the PNP’s second top post, he was reassigned as chief of the Area Police Command (APC) in the Visayas. His replacement, Lt. Gen. Jose Chiquito Malayo, was chief of the directorial staff, the PNP’s fourth highest rank. Lt. Gen. Vicente Danao, the previous deputy chief for operations, the PNP’s no. 3 post, was named the new head of APC Western Mindanao. Before Azurin’s appointment, he served as PNP officer in charge for almost three months. Break with tradition Maj. Gen. Benjamin Santos and Maj. Gen. Arthur Bisnar will replace Danao and Malayo, respectively. Azurin’s move came as a surprise as traditionally, those who hold the second, third, and fourth highest positions are not reassigned to posts outside of the command group — consisting of the highest-ranking posts in the PNP — until their retirement. Sermonia and Danao, who were contenders for PNP chief, still have a long way to go before they reach 56, the mandatory retirement age for policemen. Sermonia is set to retire on Jan. 26, 2024, and Danao on Aug. 10, 2023. The APCs used to be the Directorate for Integrated Police Operations, which were held by two-star major generals. During the time of former PNP chief Debold Sinas, the posts were renamed as APCs and given to three-star lieutenant generals. There are five APCs in the PNP: Northern Luzon, Southern Luzon, Visayas, Western Mindanao and Eastern Mindanao. The heads of the APCs are part of the PNP directorial staff. Before his appointment as the 28th PNP chief, Azurin was director of the APC in Northern Luzon. Other new APC acting commanders are Maj. Gen. Patrick Villacorte in Eastern Mindanao; and Maj. Gen. Felipe Natividad in Northern Luzon. Azurin also designated Brig. Gen. Jonnel Estomo as the new director of the National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) in place of Natividad, who served for five months. The five district directors of the NCRPO were also replaced: Col. Jaysen de Guzman for Quezon City Police District, Col. Andre Dizon for Manila Police District, Col. Kirby John Kraft for Southern Police District, Col. Wilson Asueta for Eastern Police District and Col. Ponce Peñones for Northern Police District. With their appointment, the five will be promoted to the rank of brigadier generals. The PNP defended the reshuffle of personnel occupying key posts, saying it was aimed at providing opportunities and career growth. “At the same time, this move shall strengthen and empower strategic offices and units with the placement of more seasoned and experienced senior officers at their helms to further hone the operational and administrative undertakings against criminality, enforcement of the law and maintenance of peace and order,” Brig. Gen. Roderick Augustus Alba , chief of the PNP Public Information Office chief, said in a statement.

In a report, the Department of Agriculture (DA) said that agricultural damage was at P3.41 billion as of Tuesday, up from the P3.16 billion reported on Saturday. READ: Infrastructure damage due to Paeng exceeds P4.5 billion — NDRRMC Paeng affected 89,142 farmers and fishers in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Cagayan Valley, Central Luzon, Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon), Mimaropa (Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan), Bicol, Western Visayas, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Central Mindanao and Soccsksargen. The volume of production loss was estimated at 207,854 metric tons spanning 89,011 hectares of land. “Affected commodities include rice, corn, high-value crops, fisheries, livestock and poultry. Damage has also been incurred in agricultural infrastructures, machineries and equipment,” the DA said. Paeng’s impact on the essential sector eclipsed the P3.12 billion in losses wrought by Supertyphoon “Karding” in September and the P1.13 billion worth of damage left by Severe Tropical Storm “Florita” in August. It also surpassed the P594.02 million in damage reported earlier following the onslaught of Tropical Depression “Maymay” and Typhoon “Neneng.” Rice damaged most Rice accounted for more than 60 percent of the accounted damage at P2.05 billion, followed by high-value crops at P717.68 million.The DA said it was continuously coordinating with the national government, affected local government units and other disaster risk reduction and management-related offices on the impact of the tropical cyclones, as well as available resources for interventions and assistance. It added that it was ready to distribute P1.74 billion worth of rice seeds, P11.57 million worth of corn seeds and P20.01 million worth of assorted vegetable seeds, on top of P176,000 worth of animal heads, drugs and biologics for livestock and poultry.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The business community on Tuesday urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to build on the gains of his first year in office and learn from his administration’s early missteps, as they called on the government to make the country more conducive to both foreign and local investments. Former Finance Undersecretary Romeo Bernardo, who is now a country analyst for New York-based think tank Global Source Partners, said the Marcos administration had its hits and misses during its first year, highlighting what it had done right as well as the mistakes that it can learn from. “Where the administration got it right from the start was to abandon lockdown as a policy to control Covid. This unleashed unexpectedly large pent-up demand quickly that pushed last year’s [gross domestic product] growth past most forecasts,” Bernardo said in a policy brief. To recall, the economy posted a 7.6-percent growth in 2022, a performance touted by Mr. Marcos as the highest in 46 years amid the lingering impact of the coronavirus pandemic. “Where it most evidently got it wrong was in managing food supplies. Skyrocketing prices of items that make up a tiny part of the consumer’s food basket — notably sugar and onions — generated outsized impacts on inflation at a time of already elevated global food and energy prices,” Bernardo added. The Marcos administration had struggled to keep down the prices and ensure an adequate supply of some key agricultural food commodities, including sugar and red onion, during the latter part of 2022. Prices of sugar spiked to as high as P90 per kilogram during the latter part of the year while red onions reached prices of P540 per kg to a high of P700 per kg in markets in Metro Manila. Bernardo said the administration may be credited for steps it took to build on the foreign investment liberalization laws left behind by the previous administration of Rodrigo Duterte. Furthermore, he said the administration caught the eye of foreign policy experts by moving further away from an overly pro-China stance while trying to avoid antagonizing the neighborhood giant. Likewise, he noted that Marcos’ foreign trips to major industrialized countries also served as roadshows to showcase the Philippines as an investment destination. “One year on, positive reviews on the administration’s performance from business circles’ appreciation that President Marcos has exhibited none of his father’s autocratic qualities, nor of his predecessor’s uncivility, boorishness,” he said. Bernardo also said Marcos has been praised for choosing high-caliber Cabinet members, adding that “his personal, more consultative style vis-à-vis the business sector has also been welcomed.” RELATED STORIES Sona report card: Hits, misses from Bongbong Marcos’ 2022 promises Bongbong Marcos says 2nd Sona could have been better: It was lacking Groups decry zero mention of reclamation in Bongbong Marcos’ 2nd Sona",

    "date_published": "2023-05-16T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is eyeing to expand the country’s participation in the global value chain for electronic products as it hopes to capture opportunities for research and development as well as wafer semiconductor production. In a news forum over the weekend, Trade Assistant Secretary for Industry Development and Trade Policy Allan Gepty said the current thrust of the DTI is to enhance the country’s participation in the global value chain. “Currently, when it comes to electronic products, we know that this is the niche of the Philippines,” Gepty said. However, he pointed out that the country’s participation is in the assembly of electronic products and testing. “In the value chain, we have two aspects that we are targeting, the research and technology and the production of wafer technology,” Gepty said. “So this means that if we get or if we capture those additional stages, it will be a big thing for our electronics industry because we are able to establish a niche in that particular sector,” he said. The trade official said the country is also encouraging the manufacture and assembly of final products in the country as these products would have higher value, adding that the country doesn’t just want to supply components or elements of certain high technology products. Latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that electronic products were the country’s top export in March among commodity groups with total earnings of $3.49 billion or 53.4 percent of the country’s total exports during the period. The March figure, however, was 12 percent lower than the $3.96 billion worth of electronics exports in the same month last year. From January to March, electronics exports also declined by 17.5 percent to $9 billion from $10.91 billion in the same period last year. Semiconductors accounted for the bulk of the electronic product exports in the first quarter, totaling $6.837 billion. This, however, is 16.7 percent lower than the $8.205 billion worth of semiconductor exports in the same period a year ago. Last month, the DTI said it continues to pursue initiatives to strengthen the country’s semiconductor industry. Among these efforts include its collaboration with the Semiconductor and Electronics Industries in the Philippines Foundation, Inc. (SEIPI), where DTI led a delegation in January 2023 to the US’ Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023, dubbed as the “most influential tech event in the world.” “The country’s participation resulted in potential cooperation between US-based high-tech companies with Philippines-based companies. The CES 2023 participation was followed through by trade and investment promotion activities during the Presidential working visit to Japan in February where the President was able to secure multi-billion investments in the Philippines’ semiconductor industry,” the DTI said earlier.",

    "date_published": "2022-07-13T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — Cebu City Councilor Joel Garganera, chief of the city’s Emergency Operations Center (EOC), has urged the Department of Health (DOH) to make a second COVID booster shot available to the general population. According to the city’s public information office, several companies have approached Garganera for help because they have vaccines available but could not administer the same to employees owing to an existing government policy. For now, only medical frontliners, senior citizens, and persons with serious comorbidities can avail of a second booster shot. Time, however, is of the essence because these vaccines – thousands of them – will expire in July. “It’s either we dispense it and give it to the employees, or just allow it to go to waste,” Garganera said as quoted by the PIO. “We need to urge the IATF (Inter-Agency Task Force) or the DOH because there are a lot of companies whose employees are willing to be vaccinated (for second booster), but there is no directive,” he added. Garganera said he has already forwarded letter requests from various companies, as well his own, to DOH Central Visayas. He said the national government should take into consideration the situation in each local government unit in deciding the administration of a second booster. Cebu City, for one, has surpassed its target population for COVID vaccination, which makes its residents already eligible for booster shots. He pointed out that unlike in the previous year, vaccines are now readily available. Based on the data from the Vaccination Operations Center, as of July 11, 2022, the city has vaccinated 847,520 residents or 117.71 percent of its eligible population. City Health Department officer-in-charge Jeffrey Ibones said the campaign for primary and booster shots continues. Aside from the vaccination sites at malls, the city has also opened sites in different barangays, in partnership with the Department of Education, in preparation for the return to face-to-face classes. The CHD has also fielded three teams for the “Toktok Bakuna” program wherein vaccines are brought to houses. “If they are getting their second dose or their first booster, they should just bring their vaccination card to the site,” Ibones said. While a second booster shot is not available for all just yet, Ibones said they provide the second shot in special cases like when it is a requirement for employment of travel abroad. – JMO (FREEMAN)",

    "date_published": "2023-12-27T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "BOI-approved projects in 2023 MANILA, Philippines — Investments approved by the Board of Investments (BOI) rose to an all-time high of P1.16 trillion as of Dec. 18, the highest ever in the agency’s history. The BOI said the latest investment figures exceeded the previous record of P1.14 trillion posted in 2019 and 59 percent higher than last year’s P729.1 billion. This is the fourth time that the BOI has surpassed the trillion-peso mark in investment approvals. “The BOI hitting P1.16 trillion for 2023 reaffirms strong investor confidence in the administration of President Marcos – their responsiveness to the policy initiatives of the President and the effectiveness of the aggressive investment promotion activities under the ‘Make It Happen in the Philippines’ campaign,” Trade Secretary and BOI chairman Alfredo Pascual said. “With this remarkable milestone, we are all the more optimistic about opportunities that lie ahead in 2024, with the BOI poised to further catalyze smart- and sustainability-driven investments in the country,” he added. The year-to-date approvals cover 303 projects, which are expected to generate 47,195 jobs. While the year-to date investment approvals have yet to reach the P1.5-trillion target for 2023, the investment promotion agency said that about P350 billion worth of projects may still be approved before the year ends. “There are three more projects worth about P350 billion that are currently being assessed and, if they are able to comply with both the substantive and transparency requirements, they may be able to make it to the BOI board and mancom deliberations on Dec. 28 – our last for the year,” Trade Undersecretary and BOI managing head Ceferino Rodolfo said. “While the BOI is the private sector’s strongest partner in promoting ease of doing business in the country, we remain a prudent administrator of fiscal incentives,” he said. Foreign investments accounted for the bulk of the approvals at P763.22 billion, a dramatic 452-percent increase from P138.18 billion a year ago. Germany emerged as the leading source of foreign investments, contributing a substantial P393.28 billion. This was followed by the Netherlands with P333.61 billion, Singapore (P17.38 billion) and the United States (P3.38 billion). In contrast, domestic investment approvals reached P398.76 billion. In terms of destination domestic regions, Western Visayas was the top recipient of investments at P316.89 billion, with Calabarzon taking second place at P211.89 billion. The Bicol Region posted P162.92 billion worth of investment approvals, while Eastern Visayas and the Ilocos Region had P128.62 billion and P122.18 billion, respectively. “Noteworthy projects approved for January to December were seven offshore wind power projects located in Cavite, Laguna, Dagupan, San Miguel Bay, Negros and Northern Samar amounting to a total of P759.84 billion,” the BOI said. The information and communication sector also demonstrated strong growth, securing approvals worth P96.16 billion, while the manufacturing sector also made a significant impact with P22.03 billion. Additionally, the infrastructure (toll roads) sector attracted investments worth P20 billion while the real estate sector, specifically mass housing received P15.63 billion in investments.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Marcos administration is intensifying its crackdown on illegal trade activities in the agriculture sector, targeting large-scale smugglers, hoarders, profiteers and cartel operators who disrupt supply chains and threaten the livelihood of Filipino farmers and fisherfolk. On Wednesday, the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Council held its inaugural meeting at Malacañang to enforce the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act or Republic Act 12022 enacted last October. The law imposes stiffer penalties, including longer prison sentences and heavier fines, on those found engaged in agricultural smuggling, hoarding, profiteering and cartel activities. Chaired by Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go, the meeting formalized the establishment of teams tasked with enforcing the new law. “With both the law and the implementation team now fully established, we are poised to aggressively target economic saboteurs, especially in the vital sectors of agriculture and fisheries. This will empower us to protect our local farmers, fisherfolk and consumers, ensuring a better quality of life for our people,” Go said. The council convened officials from key government agencies, including the Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Finance (DOF), Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Philippine National Police (PNP). During the meeting, specialized working groups were formed, such as an enforcement group comprising personnel from the PNP, DOF, National Bureau of Investigation and Philippine Coast Guard. Discussions centered on the creation of a Daily Price Index (DPI) to monitor agricultural prices. The DA’s Agribusiness and Marketing Assistance Service will manage the DPI, while the DOF and the Department of Trade and Industry will oversee the National Single Window for cargo clearance to curb the flow of illegal imports. The council also established an executive committee authorized to convene at any time to issue Letters of Authority to the Enforcement Group, based on intelligence information or evidence, ensuring swift action against violators. “Together, we are sending a strong message that those who undermine our agricultural sectors will face swift and decisive action,” Go said, underscoring the administration’s commitment to stabilizing the agricultural sector. The council is set to meet quarterly, with special sessions convened as needed to sustain efforts against agricultural economic sabotage and protect the country’s food supply chain.",

DOLE-7 said that once all materials, jigs, and equipment for the business are ready, beneficiaries will each man their own NegoKart worth more than P26,000 each. The beneficiaries would engage either in rice retailing or in selling cake and pastries, RTW, frozen products, fruits, siomao, ngohiong, barbeque, egg, seafood, water, puto cheese, fish, and meat. They could also have a \"silogan\" or engage in buy and sell business of motor parts. Also, DOLE likewise released P1 million in assistance for 43 Mandaue City displaced workers as part of its \"DOLE Integrated Livelihood and Emergency Employment Program.\" The program aims to contribute to poverty reduction and reduce vulnerability to risks of the poor, vulnerable, and marginalized workers. The Mandaue City Public Market Vendors Multi-Purpose Cooperative, as DOLE’s accredited co-partner, received the amount on behalf of the beneficiaries. The assistance marks the start of the livelihood projects for 20 beneficiaries in the form of \"Livelihood Starter Kits\" and the enhancement of the existing bakery business of 23 more recipients. Their business will revolve around operating a sari-sari store or a carenderia, meat products selling, swine production, and selling of vegetables. DOLE-7 added that part of the assistance extended to the beneficiaries is the Group Personal Accident Insurance coverage with the Government Service Insurance System. — (FREEMAN)",

As reported by the Cebu City Public Information Office (PIO), this was revealed during a joint consultative meeting between the cities of Cebu and Mandaue, which signed an agreement last month to jointly work on rehabilitating Mahiga River, which lies at their common boundary. In the meeting, DPWH-7 Maintenance Division Chief. Faustino dela Cruz, Jr. said they already allocated the budget for Mahiga River, which they identified as one of the major factors that caused massive flooding in both cities. He said they also committed to take charge in surveying the river so the two local government units (LGUs) could proceed with the identification and verification of residents who would be affected by the recovery of the three-meter easement on both sides of the river. Department of Environment and Natural Resources(DENR)-7 Regional Executive Director Paquito D. Melicor, Jr. also expressed their commitment to assist the two LGUs in the problem. Melicor said they will forward Mahiga River's “shapefile” tomorrow, October 16, to address the burden of identifying ownership of the affected properties. According to mapscaping.com, a shapefile is a \"common data format for storing spatial data in geographic information systems software.\" The data it contains include boundaries and geographic features like roads, rivers, and buildings. In its report, the PIO said that residents affected by forthcoming clearing operations would be called to a meeting on Nov. 25 and 26, as agreed by both cities. The two LGUs, on the other hand, have agreed to joint desilting operations, as an immediate intervention to the flooding problem caused by Mahiga River. Meanwhile, Cebu City Environment and Natural Resources Officer-in-charge Reymar Hijara suggested the reactivation of the Barangay Ecological Solid Waste Management Council, after the Oct. 30 elections. Hijara said, that once the council is reactivated, all laws and regulations in relation to solid waste would have to be strictly implemented. — (FREEMAN)",

Benjamin Acorda Jr., who earlier said that 60 percent or 136,800 of the 228,000-strong police force are against the proposed contributions to their pension ranging from five percent to nine percent. For Marcos, officials pushing for such a policy for those in the uniformed service are committing a sin not only against God but the government. Acorda earlier said the deductions for the pension contribution would have a significant impact on the salaries of PNP members even without existing loans, especially on lower ranking lawmen. Instead of contributions, Marcos said another option to get funds for the pension is through the assets and properties of the PNP.",

    "date_published": "2024-05-15T19:26:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. believes the government and the private sector must pool their efforts together to improve the state of higher education after a recent Times Higher Education ranking showed Philippine universities' relatively weaker standing compared to other Asian countries. Marcos said during the National Higher Education Day Summit on Wednesday that \"much work still needs to be done\" after no Philippine university broke into the top 100 schools in THE's 2024 Asia University Rankings. The latest THE rankings show that the Philippines' best performing school, the Ateneo de Manila University, sunk from 84th place to the 401-500 bracket, while other schools dropped or maintained their ranking. \"I have stated it before but I will state it again that as far as my view of government service is concerned, the most important service that government must provide to its people is a good education. No country can prosper without a good educational background,\" the president said. Improving the country's educational standards is the government's \"highest priority\" and the \"front and center of this administration’s national development agenda,\" Marcos said. To improve the quality of the country's HEIs, the president stressed the need to involve the private sector, which currently operates 1,729 universities and colleges nationwide. This is seven times more than the number of state and local universities and colleges, but student populations are much smaller in private schools, based on 2019 data by the Commission on Higher Education (CHED). \"As with all the important developments, all the important plans that we put together, we cannot say that this is only government’s responsibility. But we should also allow private parties to participate and not shove private parties to the sidelines,\" Marcos added. \"When it comes to educating our youth, government and private schools are not competitors but must be regarded as equal partners,\" he said. Free tuition policy to stay Marcos also vowed to keep education free in state universities and colleges (SUCs) — a policy that is wildly popular among Filipinos but has also triggered questions of sustainability among economists and spotlighted the lack of facilities in government-run HEIs. In his speech, the president touted the government's allocation of nearly P134 billion for state and local universities and colleges in the 2024 budget \"so that more students can receive free tertiary education and more families will be eased of the burden of having to pay for college.\" Marcos said: \"We know that whatever is spent on education, we should never regard as an expenditure. It is an investment in our people,\" The total budget for SUCs this year is much higher than the government's initial proposed amount, which was around P100 billion, according to the 2024 National Expenditure Program. During the budget deliberations in Congress last year, 36 university presidents petitioned for the House and the Senate to restore the estimated P6.1 billion removed from their budget. Economist Edita Tan wrote in a 2017 study on the limitations of the free tuition law that the then-recently implemented Republic Act 10931 will lead to \"increased pressure on the national government budget to replace the income that SUCs lose from tuition and other fees.\"",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The proposal to upgrade the Iloilo airport is set to be submitted for approval of the National Economic and Development Authority Investment Coordination Committee (NEDA ICC), following successful negotiations between the government and Prime Asset Ventures Inc. (PAVI) of the Villar group. Public-Private Partnership (PPP) Center deputy executive director Jeffrey Manalo told reporters that there was a successful negotiation for the project as of Sept. 16. “So the next step is they will have to submit it to the appropriate approving body,” he said. With the project estimated to cost over P20 billion, the project will have to be submitted to the NEDA ICC. Manalo said a project worth over P15 billion must be submitted to the NEDA ICC before it could be endorsed and recommended for final NEDA Board approval. After the NEDA Board approval, the project will then go through a comparative challenge period of 90 days up to one year. Under a comparative challenge, the original proponent has the right to match offers submitted by other firms. “The final timeline will be determined as part of the approved parameters, terms and conditions of the project,” Manalo said. PAVI secured the original proponent status for the upgrade, as well as operations and maintenance of the Iloilo International Airport. Through the project, the aim is to improve the management and operational capability of the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines of the Iloilo International Airport. The project will involve the expansion of capacity of the passenger terminal building (PTB). In addition, it will involve the construction of an apron adjacent to the new PTB extension; renovation or maintenance of the existing terminal building; installation of the required equipment for the passenger services in the new PTB and operation and maintenance.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Up to 144 tons of smuggled carrots and onions valued at P21 million were seized yesterday at the port of Subic in Zambales. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the smuggled vegetables were found inside five shipping containers that arrived in the country on board a Chinese vessel last month. “These smuggled goods rob our government of revenues, pose a risk to public health and undermine the livelihood of our farmers,” Tiu Laurel said after inspecting the containers. He was accompanied by Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) chief Glen Panganiban, Bureau of Customs Deputy Commissioner Juvymax Yu and BOC-Subic district collector Ricardo Morales. The vegetables were reportedly imported from China by the Betron Consumer Goods Trading, which declared the shipment as frozen fish egg balls. Shortly after the arrival of the vessel, the BPI requested the BOC and the DA to inspect the contents of the shipping containers. Instead of frozen fish egg balls, authorities found assorted vegetables, including 58 and 86 tons of carrots and white onions, respectively. Import regulations require importers of fresh vegetables and other farm products to secure sanitary and phytosanitary import clearances from the BPI. For processed food items like frozen fish egg balls, importers are required to secure permits from the Food and Drug Administration. Panganiban said the seized vegetables would be tested for pesticide residues, heavy metals and microbiological contaminants. If the vegetables are found unfit for human consumption, these will be destroyed immediately, he said.",

Paolo Duterte answer allegations linking them to drug smuggling cases in 2017. “Mans and I have talked about this. Whatever issue is thrown at him, he has to answer. Whatever issues thrown at me, I have to answer. That way, the line is clear,” Duterte said during one of the activities in celebration of the 39th Kadayawan sa Dabaw festival yesterday. “Unfortunately, I cannot speak for my brother as he already issued a statement regarding the matter,” Duterte added. The Vice President said the cases filed against her husband, brother and several other people are part of a political harassment and political attacks. “I hope the people will not forget that the problem really is poverty and the continuing increase in prices of commodities,” she added. Carpio, Paolo and former presidential economic adviser Michael Yang were implicated by a former Bureau of Customs intelligence officer to an illegal drug shipment in 2017, which was intercepted in Pampanga. Duterte also confirmed yesterday that her siblings Paolo and Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte recently met with their mother, Elizabeth Zimmerman, and father, former president Rodrigo Duterte. However, she said the meeting was focused on discussing Zimmerman’s real birth date as her birthday is usually celebrated twice a year. “There was no discussion of any politics,” she added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Just two weeks after the new year, the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is now asking government agencies to start preparing their proposals for another record high budget of P5.569 trillion for 2024. Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman has issued national budget memorandum 145 containing the national budget call for fiscal year 2024. Based on the government’s fiscal program, the 2024 national expenditure program is pegged at a record high P5.569 trillion. Next year’s planned budget is 5.7 percent higher than the 2023 appropriation of P5.268 trillion approved in December last year. Pangandaman said that next year’s budget is poised to respond to the expected continuing headwinds brought about by geopolitical tensions that resulted in rising inflation and interest rates. The budget also targets to address the economic scarring that was left by the pandemic. “With clear macroeconomic objectives set in place by the medium-term fiscal framework, the 2024 budget has a blueprint by which it can achieve the eight-point socioeconomic agenda of the administration,” Pangandaman said. She said the government would continue to implement risk-managed interventions in areas of food security, transport and logistics, energy, bureaucratic efficiency and fiscal management, health, education and social protection. These aim to ensure the unimpeded and adequate delivery of social services, mitigate inflation pressures, accelerate economic recovery and address economic scarring. Further, the budget chief emphasized that the government would ensure that only implementation-ready agency proposals are included for next year. This, as the fiscal space of the government continues to be limited. This also means that agencies’ budget proposals are expected to contain concrete program plans and designs that outline key procurement and implementation milestones, including specific project locations and beneficiaries. “The government will also look into the agencies’ previous year budget utilization and performance as part of its evaluation process,” Pangandaman said. As of end-November last year, the utilization rate of the government stood at 94 percent. Moreover, Pangandaman said priority programs for next year should support the Philippine Development Plan, the roadmap that aims to transform economic sectors and institutions for a “prosperous, inclusive, and resilient society.” The government will also put emphasis on infrastructure development, including the Build Better More program, as well as digital and social infrastructure. For 2024, infrastructure spending is proposed to increase by almost 10 percent to P1.297 trillion from this year’s P1.18 trillion. Increased infrastructure spending will not in any way detract from the full support provided to the poorest, lagging, climate change and disaster risk vulnerable areas nor the social sector and basic public services,” Pangandaman said.",

    "article_body": "Lowest in 4 years MANILA, Philippines — Palay production in the first half contracted by more than five percent to a four-year low due to lower farm yield as some farmers delayed planting amid threats brought about by the El Niño phenomenon. Domestic palay or unhusked rice output in the January to June period declined by 5.5 percent to 8.53 million metric tons from 9.026 million MT, latest Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) data showed. The latest output is the lowest first-half production recorded by the country since 2020 when production fell to 8.386 million MT, based on PSA data. PSA data indicated that both production of irrigated and rainfed palay during the six-month period contracted on an annual basis. Irrigated palay output reached 6.916 million MT, down by 5.44 percent from 7.314 million MT recorded volume in the first half last year. Rainfed palay production, meanwhile, shrank by 5.7 percent year-on-year to 1.613 million MT from 1.711 million MT. The country saw larger reductions in palay output on an annual basis during the second quarter compared to the first quarter. Palay output in the second quarter contracted by 9.5 percent to 3.845 million MT from 4.247 million MT. Meanwhile, first quarter production fell by two percent year-on-year to 4.685 million MT. Government officials and industry stakeholders attributed the reduction in palay output to the ill effects of hotter and dryer weather conditions caused by the El Niño phenomenon in the first half. For one, the erratic weather conditions forced farmers to delay their planting to avoid losses. Second, palay planted by farmers who survived El Niño suffered lower crop yield. “(The contraction was) expected because of the delayed planting due to prolonged dry spell,” Agriculture Undersecretary Christopher Morales told The STAR. Morales said the Department of Agriculture (DA) is now intensifying its efforts to provide the necessary planting initiatives to boost palay production in the second half. Some of the interventions being made by the DA include the distribution of additional rice seeds as well as the contract farming of the National Irrigation Administration covering 40,000 hectares. Raul Montemayor of the Federation of Free Farmers said it was not surprising that palay output in the first half contracted since the ill effects of El Niño spilled over to the second quarter. Montemayor pointed out that the decline in palay production of nearly 500,000 MT during the reference period is equivalent to at least seven days of nationwide rice supply. The reduction in output would have to be compensated by imports to ensure that the country has sufficient stock of the staple, Montemayor told The STAR. The country’s rice imports as of July 25 have reached 2.441 million MT, a fifth higher than the 2.02 million MT recorded volume in the same period of last year, based on Bureau of Plant Industry data.",

    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — The Philippine Competition Commission (PCC) and the Department of Agriculture (DA) have joined forces and discussed strategies for addressing anti-competitive practices that impact the agriculture sector. The collaboration aims to safeguard the interests of Filipino farmers, fisherfolk, and consumers by promoting fair competition and market transparency. Key topics tackled during the meeting included price fixing, abuses of dominant market positions, and the smuggling of agricultural products—issues that distort competition and drive up prices. The recently held dialogue signified a critical step in strengthening the partnership between the PCC and DA as they work towards ensuring a level playing field in the agriculture industry. Several areas of cooperation were identified: data sharing: task force creation; case development; capacity building; and market monitoring. In data sharing, DA and PCC aims to enhance transparency by exchanging market date to better understand market dynamics. The planned task force creation also will create a specialized team to address anti-competitive practices in various agricultural sectors. The partnership also through its planned capability building program will conduct training and information exchanges to improve enforcement capabilities. A market monitoring team will also be established to conduct compliance checks and investigation into potential violations. The meeting was attended by PCC representatives, including Commissioner Ferdinand M. Negre, Executive Director Kenneth V. Tanate, and Competition Enforcement Office Director Christian Loren B. De Los Santos. The DA was represented by Undersecretaries Alvin John F. Balagbag and Roger V. Navarro, along with other senior officials from the Inspectorate and Enforcement Office. This joint initiative underscores the commitment of both agencies to fostering a competitive and fair agricultural market. By addressing anti-competitive practices, the PCC and DA aim to protect the rights of consumers and strengthen the agricultural sector, ensuring equitable benefits for all stakeholders.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Transportation (DOTr) will start the bidding for the P281-billion contracts to manage the largest rail projects in the Philippines before the year ends. In a meeting with Japanese investors, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said the government would start soliciting proposals from private firms for the operations and maintenance of the North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR) and the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP) in the fourth quarter. Bautista said the P204.6 billion contract for the NSCR would cover the operations and maintenance of the depot, trains and stations of the railway stretching between New Clark City and Calamba, Laguna. The concessionaire will also get the right to manage the interconnection of the NSCR with other rail lines like the MMSP. It will also acquire the authority to collect passenger fares and develop commercial establishments around the rail system. Like the NSCR deal, Bautista said the P76.89 billion contract for the operations and maintenance of the MMSP would include the depot, trains and stations of the subway. In turn, the operator will earn through fare collection, as well as future upgrades. The winning bidder for the operations and maintenance of the MMSP will also receive the right to handle the equipment and facilities under the Philippine Railway Institute. The MMSP will span about 33 kilometers across seven cities in Metro Manila and will cut travel time between Quezon City and the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) to 35 minutes. According to Bautista, the contract for both railways will provide a concession period of at least 15 years, on top of the partial operations slated for the NSCR. The DOTr will issue the bid details for the NSCR and MMSP by the fourth quarter. The bidding is expected to run until the first quarter of 2024. Likewise, Bautista is asking Japanese investors to consider vying for the contract to operate and maintain the NAIA. Bautista said the concessionaire would obtain the right to earn from all ends of airport operations in exchange for the investments it would make to expand passenger capacity to 62 million per annum. Last week the DOTr issued the invitation to bid for the P170.6 billion rehabilitation of the NAIA, announcing that the bidding is open to all private firms, whether Filipino or foreign. One of the main requirements to compete in the bidding is to maintain a net worth of at least P20 billion to show that the bidder is well funded to undertake the project.",

    "date_published": "2023-12-12T15:31:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A senator has called on the Department of Justice to issue an immigration lookout bulletin for controversial preacher Apollo Quiboloy amid a pending Senate probe into child abuse allegations against him and his religious group. After filing a Senate resolution calling to investigate Quiboloy and the Kingdom of Jesus Christ, Sen. Risa Hontiveros said that the justice department must prevent him from leaving the country and “(escaping) accountability.” “I urge the Department of Justice to issue an immigration lookout bulletin order, which they can do motu proprio, to prevent Quiboloy from leaving the country,” Hontiveros said in a press conference. The senator added that Quiboloy’s alleged crimes are “global in breadth” because of his wanted status in the United States. The DOJ and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) should also “work with their counterparts in the US … to make sure Quiboloy does not escape the hand of justice if the allegations against him are true,” Hontiveros said in a mix of English and Filipino. Without elaborating, Hontiveros added that there are already pending charges of rape, child abuse and trafficking lodged against Quiboloy with the DOJ that are currently for appeal. These were filed December 2019, the senator said. Hontiveros said the findings from the possible Senate investigation into Quiboloy could determine whether the accusations of “victim-survivors’” can be used as evidence for a formal complaint against him. “If it is proven from our hearing and from the findings and recommendations of the committee report that he really committed the offenses against the victim-survivors off the top of my head… And if he can testify during our hearing, that will serve as part of the foundation to prosecute him,” the senator said. Hontiveros added that the Senate committee cannot force witnesses to attend the hearing but senators retain the power to compel resource speakers like Quiboloy to show up. While the senator said she is keeping an eye on Quiboloy’s pending case abroad, she said that a domestic investigation remains the priority for now. “Let’s take care of the one here in our backyard first. And because overall, if the process of truth and justice is progressing here in the Philippines, it will probably also help the process in other countries,” Hontiveros added. Philstar.com has reached out to DOJ for comment and will update this story with their response. Quiboloy, who was indicted by a California court in 2021 for allegedly conspiring to engage in sex trafficking, has an active arrest warrant in the US issued Nov. 10, 2021, according to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation's website. The US Department of Treasury in 2022 blocked Quiboloy's assets over what it described as \"serious human rights abuses\" committed by the preacher. \"For more than a decade, Apollo Carreon Quiboloy engaged in serious human rights abuse, including a pattern of systemic and pervasive rape of girls as young as 11 years old, as well as other physical abuse,\" the US Treasury said.",

    "article_body": "In the recently held 2024 budget conference of the Department of Budget Management (DBM), P5.569 trillion is being planned for the year, around 10 percent higher than 2023. Even with the optimistic scenario of 7 percent GDP growth for 2022, the possible deficit of P1.5 trillion still looms. Therefore, the 2024 budget could result in a worrisome deficit. A whiff of fresh air, however, was DBM’s Secretary Amenah Pangandaman’s pronouncements regarding what they intend to focus on in the 2024 budget planning and review: • Given limited resources…only implementation-ready agency proposals are included. • Budget proposals should contain concrete program plan so we can manage our budget efficiently and effectively. • Agencies’ budget utilization as well as performance will be part of the evaluation process. What seems missing in the DBM budget briefings is what are the expected sources of taxes and other revenues to cope with such huge expenditure plans, or how does government intend to squirm through the cumulative deficits already incurred? The growing budget needs are quite understandable for a growing population; however, we haven’t heard of any further good news about the foreign investment commitments from PBBM’s foreign sorties. With the P13-trillion carryover government debt in 2021, a deficit of P1.5 trillion for 2022 and a similar amount of deficit looming for 2023, how would government source the additional funds needed for 2023? What can throw a monkey wrench in all these good budget plans and intentions is the usual political pressure like the ubiquitous pork barrels, although disguised differently. Only the resolute and pragmatic leadership of the President can help steer through them. – Marvel K. Tan, CPA marvelktan@yahoo.com",

    "article_body": "BACOLOD CITY, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) and Sugar Regulatory Administration (SRA) are being urged to investigate possible “sugar market abuse,” which aims to prevent the destabilization of the sugar industry. The Save the Sugar Industry Movement (SAVE-SIM) meanwhile called on the DA and SRA to be vigilant against sugar market abuse that will affect directly and indirectly about two to three million Filipinos. “When a group of sugar producers allegedly has the ability to maintain high prices of sugar by reducing its output or by withholding supply, and offering sugar at a price, which is significantly higher, they are said to be exercising sugar market abuse,” SAVE- SIM convenor Wennie Sancho said. The group has submitted a position paper to the SRA, expressing its vehement opposition to the government’s plan to import 450,000 metric tons (MT) of sugar. The United Sugar Producers Federation, the largest sugar association in the country, has expressed support for the proposed importation of 450,000 MT of refined sugar to stabilize retail prices. The Confederation of Sugar Producers Associations, however, has recommended the importation of a more conservative volume of sugar, less than the 450,000 MT being proposed by the DA and SRA, and intended to serve as a two-month buffer stock. On the other hand, the National Federation of Sugarcane Planters also said it remains consistent in its position that the importation should be only for the specific volume needed for the buffer stock, and it should arrive in several properly scheduled tranches after the milling season. Sancho stressed the need for sugar planters to unite to ensure that the effects of sugar destabilization will be prevented to protect sugar workers. He noted that 60 percent of sugar in the Philippines is being supplied by Negros island. He pointed out that the sugar industry would be destabilized if there is an oversupply of sugar. Sancho also warned that oversupply of imported sugar in the country would lead to plummeting sugar prices due to a glut or excessive quantity. He said the sugar industry would collapse, and there would be an economic catastrophe unparalleled in scope and magnitude. “The economic and social cost will be devastating, and we will experience undeserved suffering,” he added.",

Rosario Vergeire in the malversation and graft cases that he previously filed before the Office of the Ombudsman in relation to the agency’s cancer program. Dr. Clarito Cairo Jr., who headed the DOH’s Cancer Control and Prevention Program, amended his complaint-affidavit to include Vergeire, citing “significant developments and the emergence of breakthrough evidence.” Cairo had filed criminal and administrative complaints against six DOH officials over the supposed mismanagement of P786 million funding for Cancer and Supportive-Palliative Medicine Access Program (CSPMAP) and another P529 million for the Cancer Assistance Fund. He alleged that the DOH sub-allotted the funding last year to fewer hospitals and purchased supposedly more expensive medicines for cancer patients. Included in the original complaint were Health Undersecretary Beverly Lorraine, former DOH director IV Anna Melissa Guerrero, directors IV Razel Nikka Hao and Anthony Cu, Disease Prevention and Control Bureau-Financial and Supply Chain Monitoring Division chief Kim Patrick Tejano and Cancer Control Division head Jan Aura Laurelle Llevado. In his amended complaint, Cairo said Vergeire, as acting health chief and undersecretary for public health services team, had full control of the cancer funds and had participated in its alleged mismanagement. “By sub-allotting the CSPMAP funds to only 20 hospitals, many cancer patients, who were enrolled in 11 access sites that did not get the much-needed allocation of medicines, had to discontinue their lifesaving treatment,” the complaint read. The DOH earlier maintained that all the transactions in connection with the implementation of the CSPMAP for 2022 were above board and accounted for.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The country’s first integrated city-wide bus service is nearing to materialize with the Department of Transportation (DOTr) now looking for a consultant who will be tasked to oversee the project. In a request for expression of interest, the DOTr have asked consultancy firms to submit their qualifications to manage the Davao Public Transport Modernization Project (DPTMP). The consultant will be mandated to administer contracts, supervise the design and construction of the project, and monitor its progress. According to the DOTr, the consultant will work on the project for at least three years: 22 months to implement the contracts; 12 months to identify faults; and two months to close out the project. The DOTr will come up with a shortlist of consultants from those who submitted expressions of interest. Afterward, the agency will conduct a competitive bidding for the contract following the procurement rules issued by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the financier of the project. The DPTMP seeks to set up the country’s first city-wide bus-based public transport that features performance-based employment and uses an integrated fare collection system. The DPTMP will introduce a traffic management system in Davao City prioritizing bus services along a core network of around 110 kilometers. The core network of the project will form part of an integrated route with feeder lines stretching an additional 400 kilometers, with associated passenger terminal and bus terminal facilities. Under the DPTMP, the DOTr will start a high-priority bus system based on a four-tier structure. The first tier, Metro Davao, will connect commercial centers around Davao City by putting up a backbone service that meets its mobility demands. The second tier, Davao Inter, will bridge the inner areas of the city to the central business district. The third tier, Davao Feeder, will link commuters from small-scale towns to Metro Davao, while the fourth tier, Davao Local, will serve as the main transport for outer areas surrounding the city. The government has requested $1.3 billion from the ADB to deliver the project, of which $800 million will serve as primary funding while $503 million will come as secondary capital. For 2023, the ADB has allocated $4 billion in loans for the Philippines, including $1 billion for the DPTMP.",

    "date_published": "2024-06-03T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The country’s metallic mineral output declined in the first quarter, as the industry suffered cutbacks in metal prices and slowdown in mine production, according to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau (MGB). Latest MGB data showed that metal production in the first three months of the year fell by 12.75 percent year-on-year to P51.814 billion. The production of key metals such as gold, silver and nickel all declined during the reference period. Gold output, which accounted for half of the total metallic production, fell by 14.35 percent on an annual basis to 7,178 kilograms (kg). The value of gold production decreased by 3.55 percent to P26.95 billion from last year’s P27.908 billion. Nonetheless, MGB remained optimistic that global gold prices would remain elevated this year due to ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, thus, buoying the value of the country’s metal output. “With the ongoing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, gold prices are expected to remain upbeat during the rest of the year,” the attached agency of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources said. “We witnessed the yellow metal prices breaking the $2,000 per troy ounce mark. Such a run began in December 2023 with $2,035.91 per troy ounce and was sustained during the review period,” it added. The average price of gold per troy ounce in the first quarter stood at $2,070.05 versus last year’s $1,889.05 average quotation, according to the MGB. MGB data also showed that nickel ore production declined by 16.6 percent year-on-year to 3.814 million dry metric tons (DMT) from 4.573 million DMT. Likewise, the value of the nickel output plunged by 36 percent to P7.631 billion from last year’s P11.844 billion. The government agency noted that 22 nickel mines did not report any production in the first quarter due to unfavorable weather conditions, being under off-season and maintenance as well as low nickel prices. MGB noted that nickel mining is “vulnerable” to wet weather conditions since it is a surface mining. “In the region of Caraga, which is hailed as the nickel capital of the country, more rain was felt during the first and fourth quarters of the year, with January being the wettest month, thus affecting mining operations,” the MGB said. Meanwhile, the country’s copper production grew by 4.4 percent to 67,582 MT from 64,730 MT recorded volume in the first quarter of last year. However, the value of the copper production declined by 3.25 percent year-on-year to P6.297 billion due to low prevailing global prices for the metal. “Again, the lower copper price during the period spelled the difference from $4.05 per pound to $3.83 per pound year-on-year,” the MGB said. The country’s silver production in the first quarter fell by 6.4 percent to 10,603 kg. However, the value of silver output inched up to P452.725 million from P449.231 million.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) could not immediately confirm if there are Filipino casualties amid the wildfires in Maui, but the Maui Filipino Chamber of Commerce (MFCC) reported that hundreds of Filipinos are missing. The destructive wildfires in the Hawaiian island of Maui have left more than 1,000 missing. “The number of casualties is still going up. We don’t know who they are yet, so search and rescue is still ongoing,” MFCC director Kit Zulueta Furukawa told GMA Integrated News on Saturday. Furukawa added that there are no official reports on how many Filipinos were affected by the wildfires. “The last news we had was on Friday when we talked to the Consul General there… No Filipinos were affected because most Filipinos in Hawaii are not in Maui,” DFA Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said in an interview over dzBB. The Philippine Consulate General in Honolulu said concerned families and Filipinos affected by the wildfires may get in touch with the consulate through its emergency hotline (+1 808 253 9466), email (honolulu.pcg@dfa.gov.ph), or Facebook page. The United States Department of Defense said a Navy maritime strike squadron has deployed two MH-60R Seahawk helicopters to the region to assist with the US Coast Guard’s search and recovery efforts. The US Coast Guardsmen from Station Maui have been actively assisting in search and rescue efforts. The crew aboard a Coast Guard 45-foot response boat based in Maui has also assisted state and local partners in rescuing 14 individuals from the waters off the island’s coast as of early Thursday. The fast-moving blaze, fueled by strong winds from a nearby hurricane, began in Lahaina on the island of Maui on Aug. 7, leaving 93 people dead and destroying hundreds of structures.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Manila Bay is still abundant in marine resources, fisherfolk group Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) said yesterday, following reports that some local government units were discouraging small fishers from fishing in Manila Bay by saying that it is already a “dead” body of water. “Contrary to the claims of local officials, Manila Bay is still diverse with marine resources. In fact, a significant fishing population from Cavite, Metro Manila, Bulacan and Bataan rely on its fishing grounds,” Pamalakaya national chairperson Fernando Hicap said in a statement. The fisherfolk group cited a report from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR)’s Ecosystems Research and Development Bureau showing that coral reefs still thrive in Cavite. The report said that 72 percent of coral reefs in the bay are found in the province. Pamalakaya, however, said the bay’s resources are threatened by massive reclamation projects. Based on the group’s record, there are at least 30 pending and ongoing reclamation projects in Manila, of which 21 have been issued environmental compliance certificates by the DENR. Among the projects that have environmental permits are the 420-hectare Bacoor Reclamation project, the 2,500-hectare Bulacan Aerotropolis project, a 360-hectare reclamation project in Pasay, a 650-hectare reclamation project in Navotas and the 419-hectare Horizon Manila project. “We have sought help from the DENR under its current secretary, Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga, but to no avail,” Hicap said. He called on local governments to demand that the government stop “destructive” reclamation activities and “promote genuine rehabilitation.” – Danessa Rivera",

This higher benefit is part of the increase of all benefit packages it implemented starting Feb. 14. “With the 30 percent increase, it is now P13,000,” vice president for corporate affairs Rey Baleña said in a Viber message, adding that the package covers inpatient care for dengue.? The agency also reminded the public that, when confined, PhilHealth has the “No Balance Billing” policy, which means no additional payment if one is admitted or confined in a ward-type accommodation, both in public or private hospitals accredited by PhilHealth.? Earlier, the DOH cautioned the public on a possible increase in dengue cases. It said the previous declining trend is starting to plateau.? “This could be the start of a rise in cases nationwide if we will not search and destroy mosquito water or stagnant water in any areas or containers that may breed dengue mosquitoes,” the DOH said.?

    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — More socialized housing units are expected to float in the market following the government’s move to update the price ceiling for the mass housing segment. Developer Jose Soberano III expects more property companies like Cebu Landmasters Inc., (CLI) to build housing projects for the masses. However, the challenge of finding the right location remains to be a challenge. In an interview with Soberano, he said that the adjustment of price ceiling for socialized housing would encourage companies to support the government’s desperate move to address the housing backlog in the country. The Philippine government is looking at increasing the price cap for socialized housing from P480,000 to P1.8 million for vertical projects to cater to the Pambansang Pabahay Para sa Pilipino (4PH) Program. “With this kind of (price) ceiling, this will encourage more developers to build. This is very favorable for developers because you are hitting the level of the economic side of the market,” he said adding that the adjustment will encourage more real estate players to serve the mass market as it will now be economically viable for them, thus helping the country solve its six million housing backlog. The adjusted price ceiling only applies to vertical projects with 10 floors and above. Soberano, who is the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) of Cebu Landmasters Inc., (CLI) added that his company is seriously pursuing socialized or affordable housing projects. Real estate players and groups have been asking the National Economic and Development Authority and Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development to increase the price cap for socialized housing as cost of construction materials and labor have changed over the years. Soberano said the previous price ceiling was a challenge for developers to even break even. Under the current price ceiling law, the price for a 22-square-meter (sq.m) socialized horizontal housing unit was P480,000. A 24-sq.m. property cost P530,000 and a 28-sq. m. unit is at P580,000. Soberano admitted that choosing locations would now be a challenge for developers. “We have to make sure that the locations would be convenient to the target market and at the same time affordable,” he said. — (FREEMAN)",

    "date_published": "2023-01-19T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Suspended Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) chief Gerald Bantag has failed in his bid to have his murder case over the killing of broadcaster Percy Lapid be heard at the Office of the Ombudsman. In a 17-page resolution released yesterday, the Department of Justice denied Bantag’s motion to inhibit DOJ prosecutors from the case. “No room for inhibition can be had in these cases,” the DOJ said, noting that Bantag’s right to due process was not violated. “Apparently, for the panel to inhibit the entire DOJ is beyond its authority because such action will also include the proceedings applicable to petitions for review under the DOJ. Otherwise stated, to rule on the inhibition of the entire DOJ would be contrary to existing laws and rules of procedure,” the department added. Last December, Bantag filed a petition seeking to transfer the investigation of the murder case from the DOJ to the Office to the Ombudsman. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the request is not possible. Bantag’s lawyer Rocky Balisong cited as one of the grounds for inhibition the exchange of barbs between his client and Remulla. Balisong said the suspended prisons chief deserves an “impartial and independent probe.” In raising the issue of jurisdiction, Balisong said Remulla has the authority to review the resolutions of the DOJ investigating panel and substitute them against Bantag’s favor. However, the panel of prosecutors said Remulla’s adversarial public statements against Bantag were inevitable, considering that the BuCor is an attached agency of the DOJ. The DOJ set the preliminary investigation of the murder cases filed against Bantag on Jan. 24. The Philippine National Police and National Bureau of Investigation on Monday filed murder complaints before the DOJ against Bantag, BuCor director for security and operations Ricardo Zulueta and 10 inmates for the killing of Lapid and alleged middleman Jun Villamor. Fresh raps vs Bantag Acting BuCor chief Gregorio Catapang Jr. said they are considering filing fresh charges against Bantag, this time over allegations of assaulting prison personnel. Catapang said they are eyeing to file the complaint tomorrow. “The alleged assault happened at the New Bilibid Prison, but the BuCor employees are now in Palawan,” Catapang told reporters. “They suffered physical injuries and threats. Hopefully, we will be able to file it by Friday.” Catapang said the complainants, who are junior officers of the BuCor, were allegedly manhandled by Bantag. “There are more or less five complainants,” Catapang said. – Ralph Edwin Villanueva",

    "date_published": "2023-09-02T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Several groups expressed support for the Department of Transportation’s plan to rehabilitate the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and develop other airports in Sangley Point, Cavite and in Bulakan, Bulacan, saying these would boost tourism and the economy, and subjecting the projects under solicited bidding process is consistent with the President’s good governance directive. The groups – think tank Stratbase ADR Institute and citizen advocacy groups CitizenWatch Philippines and Bantay Konsyumer, Kalsada, Kuryente (BK3) – in a statement said they are supporting the DOTr’s decision to undertake public bidding scheme under the amended Build-Operate-Transfer Law. Stratbase president Dindo Manhit said the long-term strategy for the airport will be a great legacy for the Marcos administration. “Longstanding problems have hounded our primary gateway to the world, much to the disenfranchisement of local and foreign travelers alike. With the approval of the solicited proposal to rehabilitate the NAIA, finally, the work can begin and the country’s issues of low traffic capacity and inadequate facilities, among others, can be addressed,” he said. Manhit said the qualities of a solicited proposal could be a key factor in the project’s success. “The government’s decision to go for the solicited bid is consistent with its priority of effecting good governance through transparency and equal opportunity,” he said in the statement. “Qualified bidders are able to present their proposals competitively, where the bid most advantageous to the government, addressing the needs it itself specified, eventually wins.” Former Rep. Christopher Belmonte, co-convenor of CitizenWatch Philippines, said the current state of the airport affects citizens in several ways: “directly, when we and our loved ones travel and are hampered by various choke points and burdened by delays, and indirectly, because of the numerous economic opportunities missed when investors get discouraged and bring their business somewhere else.” “Our facilities at present are only able to serve 35 million passengers a year; we need to expand this capacity and make it accommodate at least 62 million passengers in the immediate future if we are to compete in the global economy,” he added. Meanwhile, Patrick Climaco, secretary-general of BK3, said the potential to monetize the airport will yield funds that could be used for other projects or provide and improve basic social services. “It will be the next generation that would benefit from a project of this scale,” Climaco said. “It is important that this project be made a priority and be implemented well so it could bring investments, jobs, and income, and so it could erase our airport infrastructure’s negative reputation.” In their separate statements, the three groups expressed concern on the Office of the Ombudsman’s decision to dismiss Manila International Airport Authority chief Cesar Chiong based on an anonymous complaint for grave abuse of discretion and misconduct, saying that anybody who is telling the truth should not be afraid to reveal their identity. “We hope that there will be a deeper probe into this case based on solid evidence and that the accusers should not hide behind anonymity if their charges have real basis,” Manhit said.",

PRA president Roberto Claudio said the decision to appoint Go reflects a discerning choice, citing his exceptional representation of the private sector and recognizing his potential to make a significant contribution to national economic development. “It is with immense pride and joy that we extend our warmest congratulations to you on your recent appointment as the secretary of the Office of the Special Assistant to the President for Investment and Economic Affairs (OSAPIEA) by President Marcos,” Claudio said. Go previously served as PRA president. It was during his term that the retailers group won the bid for the Philippines to host the Asia-Pacific Retailers Convention and Exhibition in 2015. Before his appointment as adviser, he was a PRA director and president of Robinsons Land Corp. Claudio said the PRA applauds Go for his dedication and steadfast support, not only for the growth and development of the retail sector but also for the overall economic progress of the nation. “As secretary of the OSAPIEA, we are confident that his extensive experience and visionary leadership will guide the OSAPIEA to new heights of success,” Claudio said.

    "date_published": "2025-05-06T09:30:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine National Police (PNP) has revealed the identities of two casino junket operators allegedly involved in handling the ransom payments for the kidnapping and killing of Chinese businessman Anson Que and his driver, Armanie Pabillo. In a press briefing on Monday, May 5, PNP spokesperson Brigadier General Jean Fajardo said the ransom money was funneled through the two casino junket operators before being transferred to crypto wallets. The casino junket operators have been identified as the 9 Dynasty Group and the White Horse Club. According to Fajardo, the 9 Dynasty Group operates in Cambodia, Japan, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. “Lahat po yan ay dinadaan sa sarili po nilang 9 Dynasties e-wallets na wala pong lisensya mula sa BSP (Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas) at hindi rin po registrado sa Anti-Money Laundering Council,” Fajardo said. (Everything goes through their own 9 Dynasties e-wallets, which do not have a license from the BSP and are also not registered with the Anti-Money Laundering Council.) The PNP spokesperson also named Li Duan Wang, the owner of 9 Dynasties, who is also known as Mark Ong. He is a Chinese national from Fujian, China. Although Congress passed legislation to grant Ong Philippine citizenship, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. vetoed the measure, citing \"dire consequences\" due to Ong's suspected involvement with Philippine offshore gaming operations. Meanwhile, the owner of the White Horse Club has yet to be identified. When asked about the amount of money funneled to the casino junket operators, PNP chief Rommel Marbil declined to disclose the total ransom transferred through e-wallets and crypto wallets, citing the need to protect the integrity of the ongoing investigation. Que and Pabillo were last seen at the Elison Steel office in Valenzuela on March 29. They were found dead along a roadside in Barangay Macabud, Rodriguez, Rizal, on April 9. Last week, the PNP identified three individuals, including David Tan Liao and two others, as masterminds in the kidnapping and slaying case. RELATED: PNP eyes 3 masterminds in Anson Que kidnap-slay",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Malaysia is exploring new scholarship opportunities for Filipino students as part of its expanded education cooperation with the Philippines, according to the Department of Education. Education Secretary Sonny Angara and Malaysian Ambassador Dato' Abdul Malik Melvin Castelino met Wednesday, January 22 to discuss potential scholarship programs aimed at making higher education more accessible for Filipinos and to \"strengthen education ties\" between the two Southeast Asian countries. \"The proposed Malaysian scholarship programs were identified as key to expanding access to higher education for Filipinos and fostering regional cooperation, sustainable peace and economic growth,\" DepEd said in a press release. Angara and the Malaysian ambassador also discussed advancing bilateral initiatives. Both countries are looking to enhance the Philippines' Madrasah Education Program, particularly in improving the Arabic Language and Islamic Values Education (ALIVE) program in public schools and private Madaris schools across the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. The meeting also touched on strengthening technical and vocational training programs following earlier discussions between President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Ahmad Zahid Bin Hamidi in October 2024. “Malaysia has long been a valued partner in education, and today we continue to build on our shared history to empower our learners and communities,” Angara said. The education cooperation between the Philippines and Malaysia is governed by a memorandum of understanding first signed in 2014 and renewed in 2019. Officials are now considering updating this agreement to include new priorities such as Halal sector development and stronger regional collaboration. “We will explore new opportunities that will benefit not only our learners but also the broader ASEAN community,” Angara said. Malaysia is this year's chairperson of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) — a position that the Philippines will assume in 2026. There are about 900,000 Filipinos in Malaysia, most of whom are household service workers, according to data by the Embassy of the Philippines in Malaysia.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — National Security Adviser (NSA) Eduardo Año wants the militant group Hamas to be officially designated and declared as a foreign terrorist organization in the Philippines. “In solidarity with the people of Israel, we will push for the designation of Hamas as a terrorist organization under RA 11479 as a priority agenda of the Anti-Terrorism Council,” he said in a statement yesterday condemning the attack on Israel. “This was a deadly and barbaric terrorist assault on Israel targeting its civilian population and Israel has every right, as much as any nation, to defend and protect itself from this attack which has already claimed more than 1,200 lives, including that of two (now three) Filipinos and wounded some 3,000 others,” Año said. With what happened and another three Filipinos still missing or unaccounted for, he said Hamas should be declared as a terrorist group under Philippine law. “Together with President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., we hope for a swift resolution to this conflict, we pray for the safety of innocent civilians and we offer our thanks to the government of Israel for its efforts to protect our citizens,” Año said. Repatriation Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro meanwhile gave assurance that the Philippine government is ready to rescue Filipinos trapped in Israel and Gaza. “Yes, we are ready, willing and able, actually, to facilitate repatriation. That’s the duty not only of the Armed Forces of the Philippines but also the Office of Civil Defense and the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC),” he declared. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the launch of the Philippines’ hosting of the 2024 Asia Pacific Ministerial Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Pasay City, Teodoro said other relevant government agencies are assessing the situation. “But we stand ready to do whatever is required of us,” he added, noting that through the NDRRMC, concerned government agencies may converge and talk “so that when and if repatriation is needed, we can decide what is the most expeditious means possible.” Monitoring Teodoro added that the security sector is not letting its guard down and is also on the lookout for the possible emergence of copycats, particularly disruptors or extremist groups who may copy whatever happened in the Middle East. “For now we haven’t seen that but it does not mean to say that we are (not) monitoring possible spillover or copycat effects. For now, we are not seeing any,” he said in English and Filipino. “I mean it always happens. So any country in this part of the world or any part of the world, even in Europe, they’re on high alert for the possible effects of this on their security situations,” he said. “It’s not only here that things happen, you know there have been ISIS spin-offs in France, in UK, wherever. Terrorism is a possibility anywhere.” Teodoro said the DND and the government should be ready for any eventuality and it needs the help and support of the public.",

Marcos made the plea as he enjoined the public in the celebration of the 2023 Drug Abuse and Prevention Control (DAPC) Week which will be held from Nov. 12 to 19. “Let us all work together to curb drug dependence among our affected citizens and facilitate the reintegration of persons with records of substance abuse to society,” Marcos said in a statement released by the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) yesterday. The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency earlier reported that 7,738 barangays in the country remain drug-affected. During Marcos’ term as president, at least 64,862 drug suspects have been arrested, 4,468 of whom are considered high-value targets. The DDB is set to hold a series of activities for this year’s DAPC which carries the theme “People First: Stop Stigma and Discrimination, Strengthen Prevention.” Among these is the launch of the “TalenTODA, Barkadahan ng mga Drivers, Riders, at Barangay Kontra Droga” program on Nov. 12. The initiative, to be participated by members of public transport groups, aims to reinforce their role as advocates of public safety and drug-free communities. On Nov. 13, the DDB will lead a nationwide pledge of commitment to remain drug-free among national government agencies, local government units, schools and universities. Pasig City will host a sports event called “Palarong Pinoy Laban sa Droga” to promote athletics and camaraderie among its citizens, groups and stakeholders who are supporting anti-drug.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines has a total of 176 projects worth P2.47 trillion in its pipeline of public-private partnership (PPP) projects. Data from the PPP Center showed that the number of projects in the PPP pipeline increased to 176 as of Feb. 10 from its Dec. 4, 2024 report, which had 172 projects. While the number of PPP projects in the pipeline increased, the total cost declined from P2.55 trillion. The PPP Center said the change in the number of projects in the pipeline is due to new additions and the delisting of some projects. Of the 15 projects added to the pipeline, four are national projects while 11 are local projects. New projects are the Manila Central Post Office, Manolo Fortich Septage and Sewage Treatment Facility, proposed preservation of the Historical Old Del Monte Airstrip, Economic Housing Subdivision – RQ Village, Baguio Water Supply Project, Philippines Digital National Identity, Pangasinan - Pambansang Pabahay para sa Pilipino Program, Baguio - Pambansang Pabahay para sa Pilipino Program, Traveler Information and Data Security System (eTRAVELPLUS), Francisco Bangoy International Airport Project, construction of New City Public Market with Multi-level Parking in Cavite, establishment of Trading Post/Bagsakan Center for wholesale and retail of the city’s agricultural products in Cavite, Baguio Central Terminal and Cultural Center, improvement and management of the Water Supply and Sanitation Services of the Freeport Area of Bataan and the Pasig Common Underground Network Project. On the other hand, nine projects were delisted in coordination with appropriate implementing agencies. Seven of the delisted projects are national projects while two are local projects. Projects removed from the PPP pipeline are the Comprehensive Digital Housing Platform Project, High-capacity Bus System in Iloilo City, Joint Venture for the Redevelopment of the Philippine National Oil Co. and Department of Energy Bonifacio Global City Properties, Zamboanga City Integrated Solid Waste Management System, Electronic Invoicing and Tax Engine Systems Project, Rizal Park Western Section Development Project, Power Generation and Distribution in San Vicente Flagship Tourism Enterprise Zone, Decarbonization Project and the Metro Rail Transit System Line 3 rehabilitation, operations and maintenance. The PPP Center said the New Bohol (Panglao) International Airport Project was also delisted from the PPP pipeline. “The project, with an estimated cost of P4.53 billion in the pipeline, is removed from the pipeline database following its award and is now reflected in the PPP Center database of projects under implementation,” the PPP Center said. Also removed from the PPP pipeline was the operations and maintenance of the Pampanga Dialysis Centers Project as this has been awarded and placed in the list of those under implementation. The government is pushing for PPPs to address the country’s infrastructure gaps. By pushing for infrastructure development, the government wants to attract more investments that will drive economic growth and create jobs.",

    "date_published": "2025-03-13T16:33:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Sen. Ronald \"Bato\" dela Rosa is seeking temporary protection from the Senate as he faces the possibility of arrest by the International Criminal Court (ICC). Former President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested by the ICC on Tuesday, March 11. On the same day, Philippine authorities, acting on an Interpol request, transported Duterte to The Hague to face trial for crimes against humanity. Dela Rosa, who served as Duterte’s Philippine National Police (PNP) chief during the bloody drug war, is believed to be next in line for an arrest warrant. The senator said he is prepared to face legal proceedings but hopes Senate President Francis Escudero will grant him refuge should the ICC issue an arrest warrant against him. “Hanggat kaya nga niya, hanggat kaya ng Senate president na kupkupin niya muna ko. Hindi niya muna ko i-surrender kung may warrant of arrest, kung na may session kami. I hope respetuhin din siya ng executive branch of government kasi mayroon naman 'yan ang ganoon protocol,” Dela Rosa said in a phone interview with reporters on Wednesday night. (As long as he can, as long as the Senate president can take me in first, I hope he will not surrender me if there is a warrant of arrest, especially while we are in session. I also hope the executive branch will respect that because there is a protocol for such cases.) However, Dela Rosa insisted that he is not in hiding. As of Wednesday night, he said he was in Surigao and Agusan, actively campaigning. Seeking refuge in the Senate Several lawmakers in the past have sought refuge in the Senate to avoid arrest. This includes former senators Antonio Trillanes IV and Leila de Lima. In 2018, then-President Duterte revoked the amnesty granted to Trillanes by the late President Benigno Aquino III. Facing charges of coup d’état and rebellion, Trillanes stayed in the Senate to avoid arrest. Similarly, De Lima temporarily sought refuge in the Senate before eventually surrendering herself to authorities. The 1987 Constitution grants lawmakers certain protections against arrest while Congress is in session. Section 11 of Article VI states: \"A Senator or Member of the House of Representatives shall, in all offenses punishable by not more than six years imprisonment, be privileged from arrest while the Congress is in session. No Member shall be questioned nor be held liable in any other place for any speech or debate in the Congress or in any committee thereof.” However, in Dela Rosa’s case, the key issue is whether the Senate is in session. The Senate is currently in recess and will not resume session until June, raising questions about whether Dela Rosa can be granted temporary protection under this provision. 204 People Reacted How Do You Feel About This Article?

According to The LATHE, the official student publication of Batangas State University-Pablo Borbon Campus, all classes at the said institution will be conducted virtually to due a bomb threat investigation. \"Everyone is instructed to leave the university premises immediately,\" said the student publication while relaying the advice of the university's Office of the Chancellor this Saturday. The Batangas Police Provincial Office later on cleared the BatStateU Pablo Borbon Constituent Campus from any threat this afternoon. According to a certification released by BatStateU's disaster managers, the alleged bomb threat was received through a text message, prompting a careful investigation on the buildings around the campus in Batangas City. \"[It] was found out that there is no bomb or any imminent danger that could threaten the safety of the students, faculty members, workers and other staffs,\" said Batangas City police officer-in-charge Police Lt. Col. Shamgar Valdez. \"This further certifies that continous investigation is still on going for the identification and possible arrest of the sender of the malicious text message that caused anxiety, panic and fear to the constituents of the province of Batangas.\" Prior to this incident, several government offices and schools based in Metro Manila, Bataan and Zambales were also subjected to various forms of bomb threats, prompting the Department of Justice to call for a probe by the National Bureau of Investigation.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines (Updated Aug. 28, 2024; 3:19 p.m.) — Vice President Sara Duterte and former President Rodrigo Duterte, close allies of fugitive Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, condemned the police operation at the Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) compound in Davao City on Saturday, where the doomsday preacher is believed to be hiding. The Dutertes released their separate statements after the raid of the Philippine National Police (PNP) in KOJC’s compound on Saturday, which involved 2000 police men. A KOJC member died of heart attack during the police operation. 'Abuse of authority' Meanwhile, in his statement, the former president, who has been tagged to have committed alleged human rights violations during his administration, said that the country has never been in a “more tragic state” as “rights have been trampled upon” by the state’s laws. “We sympathize with the members of the KoJC for having become victims of political harassment, persecution, violence and abuse of authority. This certainly puts a dark stain on the hands of those involved in today's incident, led by no less than the top police official of the region,” Rodrigo said in a statement. “Again, let us ask this administration how it can guarantee the preservation of the constitutional rights of our fellow Filipinos when even the most fundamental of these rights are being blatantly violated?” he added. Quiboloy is Duterte’s spiritual advisor and close ally. In a separate statement, the vice president also condemned the police raid, calling it a “gross abuse of police power.” She said that the raid resulted in “harassment of religious worshipers, the abuse of minors, and the unnecessary loss of life.” “These acts are not only a blatant violation of Constitutionally-protected rights but a betrayal of the trust that we, Filipinos, place in the very institution sworn to protect and serve us,” Sara said in a statement. “Hindi ko rin maiwasang matanong sa sarili kung ang paggamit ba ng di pangkaraniwang pwersa at di makatarungang pang-aabuso sa ordinaryong Pilipino, upang maipatupad ang naturang warrant of arrest, ay dahil sa ang akusado ay isang kilalang Duterte-supporter,” she added. (I cannot help but ask whether the use of extraordinary force and unjust abuse to serve the warrant is because the accused is a Duterte supporter). This has been the second time the PNP has raided the compound of Quiboloy to serve the warrants of arrest against him on the cases of child and sexual abuse charges, along with the non-bailable trafficking in persons charge. These are previously issued by courts in Pasig City and Davao City. Aside from local charges, Quiboloy is also facing outstanding warrants in the United States for child and sexual trafficking, fraud and coercion; conspiracy and bulk cash smuggling. The first raid occurred to attempt to arrest Quiboloy on July 10, which was also condemned by the former president who is also the KOJC property administrator.

In a video message posted on YouTube yesterday, Marcos said he and Anwar have known each other before they assumed their roles as fellow leaders in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). “Our friendship has helped make the challenges of leadership more bearable. Sometimes, I dare say, even enjoyable,” Marcos said. “For me you are more than just a neighbor in ASEAN, you are a trusted friend with whom I share many fond memories,” he added. Marcos said he and Anwar have addressed numerous challenges and celebrated some successes. “Much has been done, yet much is left to do. And I am glad that I have a dear friend with me as we navigate the uncertainties that lie ahead,” Marcos said. “Your wisdom, kindness, and strength have been invaluable to me. And I look forward to more years of friendship and cooperation.” Noting that he and Anwar play key roles in the region and the wider international community, Marcos said the Malaysian leader’s “unwavering” dedication to his country and their shared vision for the region have been “a source of inspiration.” “I’m grateful for every opportunity that we have had through the years to share ideas and to learn from each other’s experiences as we continue to steer our nation and the region toward a future of peace and prosperity before our peoples,” the President said. “From sharing the microphone at karaoke night to sharing the floor at the bilateral and multilateral levels, we’ve come some way,” he added. Marcos told Anwar he values the bonds that their families share as he wished him the happiest of birthdays. He expressed hope that this year would bring the Malaysian Prime Minister good health, happiness and continued success. Anwar, Malaysia’s 10th prime minister, celebrated his 77th birthday last Saturday.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Some members of Kingdom of Jesus Christ (KOJC) founder Apollo Quiboloy’s Angels of Death, a group that he allegedly used to intimidate girls he sexually abused, are registered gun holders with the Firearms and Explosives Office (FEO) of the Philippine National Police. Lt. Col. Eudisan Gultiano, the PNP Civil Security Group spokesperson, made the statement after she said they received a request from the Davao City police asking to verify the names of some people who are believed to be connected with the group. “Some of the individuals in the list are licensed and the others don’t have records with the FEO,” she told reporters yesterday. Gultiano could not give an exact number of people on the list, citing the investigation is still ongoing. The Angels of Death was tagged as Quiboloy’s tool to threaten girls whom he sexually molested. The next step is to investigate whether the people on the list have renewed their firearms licenses, noting they could face complaints for violation of Republic Act 10591 or the Comprehensive Law on Firearms and Ammunition. Also included in their probe is if the alleged members of the group were involved in criminal activities. “It could be a ground for revocation (of their firearms licenses),” Gultiano said. Meanwhile, the PNP is reviewing the videos of interviews of some prominent personalities who were vocal in their statements that Quiboloy was not at the KOJC compound when in fact he was hiding in the 30-hectare property. Asked if they will also include Vice President Sara Duterte, who said in an interview that Quiboloy is no longer in Davao, PNP spokesperson Col. Jean Fajardo said “all of those who spoke, all of the overt acts, all of the omissions.” The police are preparing obstruction of justice charges against members who were shielding Quiboloy from arrest.",

In response, manufacturers agreed to verify with their retail partners to address this concern.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) has approved the importation of 25,000 metric tons (MT) of various frozen seafood such as salmon, squid, scallops and sardines to boost domestic supply and prevent a spike in the prices of the concerned commodities. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. issued Memorandum Order 12, which provides the guidelines on the implementation of the certificate of necessity to import (CNI) covering the period from March to May. The importation allows the entry of 40 fish products of various species. The issuance of the CNI also allows the imported frozen fish items to be sold to wet markets and supermarkets. “This will add variety in the market, especially for the food service industry, since fish and marine species covered by this importation are mostly fish and marine products not caught locally,” Tiu Laurel said in a separate statement. “This should not affect local fishermen and should help in the ease of doing business,” he added. The approved fish species to be imported under the CNI are salmon, sardines, gindara, pangasius, tuna by-products, hamachi, swordfish, barramundi and fish meat. Also allowed to be imported are alaskan pollock, oilfish, halibut, cod/black cod, hake, croaker, chilean seabass, marlin, silverfish/silver sillago, eel, mullet, cobia, capelin, moonfish, yellowtail sole and hoki. The DA also approved the importation of lobster, scallops, mussels (black, green-lipped, blue), clams, red snapper, grouper, flounder, emperor, sea bream, bluefin tuna, oyster, smelt, soft/hard shell crab, octopus and squid. Sources told The STAR that the approved species per fish product are foreign ones that do not thrive or cannot be caught locally in the country, thus does not compete directly with those that local fishers catch and sell in the domestic market. Fisheries and Aquaculture Board chair Chingling Tanco told The STAR that the imported fish species would be sold to wet markets and supermarkets, boosting domestic supplies and would help arrest possible price spikes in fish commodities. The imported fish products may also be sold to other markets including hotels and restaurants, Tangco added. Tiu Laurel said those who can participate in the importation should be accredited for at least one year prior to the issuance of the order, and registered importers under Fisheries Administrative Order 259 who participated in any previous CNI. “All importers who complied may qualify to import, provided that all accreditation and registration documents are updated and complete,” the agriculture chief said in his order. Tiu Laurel added that importers with pending cases or investigations in relation to violations of any food safety or importation rules and regulations are disqualified from participating in the importation. He said an initial volume of 28 metric tons shall be allocated to each qualified importer. “The remaining volume shall be allocated to the qualified importers on a first come first serve basis,” Tiu Laurel added.",

    "date_published": "2023-09-05T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — The Alliance of Concerned Teachers Region VII (ACT VII) has recently welcomed the new school year with dismay and vigilance as they claimed that the education crisis continues to worsen under the Marcos Jr. administration. “Department of Education Secretary and Vice President Sara Duterte claims that the country is prepared for the new school year. However, this has not been the case on ground where teachers remain overworked and underpaid,” said ACT-VII. ACT-VII president Christopher Abrajano said with the increasing prices of goods and services, the entry salary of Teacher 1, which is P27,000 is not enough to sustain their family needs. He said even the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) claimed that a family of five needs P42,000 a month to survive above the poverty line. “Teachers have been shelling out money from their own pockets to provide the learning needs of their students. We receive little to no incentives despite our overtimes and sacrifices in our profession. Just like the Performance Based Bonus for 2021, it has only been recently disbursed due to the lack of urgency provided by DepEd,” said Abrajano, in a statement. He said that even with the existence of annual allowances, teachers have received less of what they deserve and need, such as the case of the rice allowances where teachers received inedible sacks of rice. ACT-VII added that these problems are concrete manifestations of the unpreparedness of the country, especially with the national government and DepEd as its education agency. “Its prioritization is directed on the provision of confidential funds instead of the needs of the whole education sector. A total of 150 Million Pesos has been allocated by DepEd Secretary Sara Duterte to the confidential funds, which is susceptible to corruption as expenditures under this budget do not need reports for transparency and accountability,” it added. ACT-VII regional vice president for senior high Jerry Almojallas, for his part, said that in Central Visayas there are limited items provided for the security of tenure among public school teachers. He said that there is a significant gap and mismatch between the number of teachers, especially in the Junior and Senior High School level, and with the number of enrollees and available facilities. “We have also received reports from fellow teachers that there are also several faulty comfort rooms. Overcrowded classrooms alongside the lack of budget surely affects the quality of teaching in general,” Almojallas said. He said that the confidential budget could have been allocated to the construction of the lacking 159,000 classrooms nationwide. Particularly in the region, wherein about 60 students occupy a classroom supposedly built to cater 30 students only. He added that if only a budget was provided for the acquisition of 4.5 million textbooks, about 4,286 laptops worth P35,000 and 250,000 public school uniforms, millions of students could have benefited. ACT-VII also demanded the DepEd, Marcos Jr., and Duterte to go beyond dramatically painting armchairs. “We demand our leaders to take full responsibility for being accomplices to the continued oppression of teachers in our country. In this new school year, the Union hopes to ignite the genuine spirit of unionism among teachers that is militant, progressive, and nationalist formation of educators and education personnel,” it further said. — (FREEMAN)",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE) said it is looking forward to working with newly appointed Finance Secretary Ralph Recto in introducing reforms that would further deepen the capital market. In a statement yesterday, the PSE’s board of directors chaired by Jose Pardo, and management led by president and CEO Ramon Monzon, expressed confidence Recto would fast-track fiscal reforms “needed to ensure the country’s economic growth, which will help boost investor confidence.” “We look forward to working with him in introducing reforms to further develop the Philippine capital market.” The PSE said that as a long-standing public servant, Recto’s “dedication, hard work, extensive experience and innate desire to uplift the lives of Filipinos will be an invaluable asset to President Marcos’ economic team. Recto, the PSE’s leaders said, is no stranger to the capital market. “He is the legislator behind Republic Act 9243 or the act rationalizing the provisions on the Documentary Stamp Tax of the National Internal Revenue Code of 1997 which introduced for the first time a documentary stamp tax exemption for stock transactions through the local stock exchange,” the PSE said. Outlining his plans, Recto said he would push for the passage of the Capital Markets Development Act and pursue reforms in public and private pensions, prioritizing the interests of beneficiaries while ensuring actuarial health and fund sustainability. Inheriting a running budget deficit of P1.11 trillion and an outstanding debt of P14.5 trillion, Recto said he would advocate for the immediate passage of key tax reforms endorsed by the President as priority measures to Congress. As a legislator, Recto authored and sponsored a number of economic measures such as the Tax Reform for Acceleration and Inclusion Act, Universal Healthcare Act, Rice Tariffication Act, Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act, General Tax Amnesty, Rationalization of Excise Tax on Automobiles, and the Social Reform and Poverty Alleviation Act.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A Filipino national in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been executed for the murder of a Saudi national, the Department of Foreign Affairs said on Tuesday, October 8. The foreign affairs department said the Philippine government provided legal assistance and explored all possible means to stay the Filipino national's execution or to reduce his punishment, but authorities proceeded to use the death penalty after the victim's family refused to accept blood money, a form of financial compensation under Islamic law for heinous crimes. \"The Philippine Government provided legal assistance and exhausted all possible remedies, including a presidential letter of appeal. But the victim’s family refused to accept blood money in return for forgiveness of the Filipino, and so the execution proceeded,\" the department said. No further details were provided regarding the identity of the Filipino national out of respect to the family's request for privacy. President Fedinand Marcos Jr. told reporters on Tuesday that the execution was a \"terrible tragedy\" and \"very unfortunate,\" but that the government had no recourse to prevent the death penalty from being meted out. After extending his condolences, Marcos said both the Saudi and Philippine governments had exhausted all possibilities before carrying out the judgment. The case had also been going on for \"five to six years\" and began well before he took office in 2022, Marcos added. “We tried everything for many, many years. The Saudi government really tried to look and to be sure that the judgment was actually deserved,” he told reporters. \"We appealed to the better nature of our friends in Saudi Arabia, to have another look. And they did,” Marcos said. “Unfortunately, the law there is very strict and apparently, the conviction has stood, and one of ours has been taken away.” Saudi Arabia uses the death penalty for a wide range of offenses, including murder. Its use of capital punishment has drawn criticism from human rights groups who say courts can arbitrarily hand down the death sentence for those peacefully expressing political dissent and drug-related charges after unfair trials. In 2019, a 39-year-old Filipino domestic worker in Saudi Arabia was found guilty of murder and executed as punishment. — Cristina Chi",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A progressive lawmaker in the House of Representatives has asked the chamber’s secretary general to lift the ban he imposed on clothes with political statements for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s first State of the Nation Address. Rep. France Castro (ACT Teachers party-list) said in a letter dated Saturday that there are no congressional rules, parliamentary practice, protocol and social norms violated by wearing statement pieces, which the Makabayan bloc that she is part of has traditionally done in past SONAs. “No such rule has ever been imposed in either House in recent history, given its intrusion into the personal freedom of dress of the Member and, more importantly, the violation of the civil and political rights of the people on whose behalf the House Member sits on the Joint Session,” Castro said. In a July 20 memorandum, House Secretary General Mark Llandro Mendoza laid down a dress code for attendees at the plenary hall and on videoconference platforms which bars the “wearing of clothes with political messages.” Rep. Raoul Manuel (Kabataan party-list) likened the ban to Martial Law, which the president’s father and namesake declared in September 1972 resulting in the curtailment of basic human rights like the freedom of speech and assembly. “This is the first time in recent history that an explicit prohibition is issued. Protests are prohibited, even messages on clothes are prohibited because they’re very afraid of art?” Manuel said partly in Filipino. “They should respect our rights to expression in our little ways.” In her letter, Castro said the wearing of lawmakers of their advocacies to the SONA, and even during regular session days, is precedented, citing the donning of Indigenous clothing, hijabs and ribbons. She added that even the wearing of Barong Filipino and Filipiniana dress as prescribed in the dress code “is a political message in itself — one that claims our heritage as Filipinos and our dedication to the Filipino.”",

    "date_published": "2024-08-14T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The transport strike will proceed today as scheduled, after Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) Chairman Romando Artes downplayed the mobilization of unconsolidated public utility jeepneys (PUJs), transport group Manibela president Mar Valbuena said yesterday. He said the group will insist on the suspension of the implementation of the public utility vehicle modernization program (PUVMP) after President Marcos did not heed the Senate resolution to suspend it. “The transport strike does not only focus on the suspension in the implementation of the PUVMP, but also to express our opposition to a program which is unfair and not affordable to ordinary drivers and operators,” Valbuena said. He added that the success of the transport strike is not measured by an immediate result, but the ability of the affected drivers and operators to unite in expressing their position. “The statement of Chairman Artes downplaying our transport strike only proves his lack of understanding of the purpose of the mobilization,” Valbuena added. He said the transport strike aims to prove that many jeepneys and operators are still against the PUVMP. “We can say that our transport strike is already a success, as we will be able to relay a message to the public and the government,” Valbuena said. He maintained that members of Manibela and another transport group, Piston, will continue to oppose the modernization program. “Win or lose, we still consider this a triumph for the transport sector,” Valbuena said. He said the current PUVMP will lead to the loss of livelihood of drivers and operators. Piston president Mody Floranda has said his group would join Manibela tomorrow, with up to 13,000 drivers, operators and commuters marching to Mendiola. Refuting claims that it was rushed, President Marcos stood firm on his decision to implement the PUVMP. Twenty-two senators signed a resolution calling for the suspension of the program. ‘Libreng Sakay’ Meanwhile, the Office of the Vice President (OVP) has committed fleets of its Libreng Sakay buses to ferry commuters who will be affected by the three-day nationwide transport strike that starts today. The Libreng Sakay buses would be dispatched to seven routes in Luzon, Visayas and Mindanao, the OVP said. Four buses have been dispatched to Metro Manila, and one each will be ferrying passengers in the cities of Cebu, Bacolod and Davao. The buses in Metro Manila, Cebu City and Davao City operate from Monday to Saturday, 5 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 9 p.m. Those in Bacolod City operate from Monday to Friday and Sundays from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. In Metro Manila, two of the four Libreng Sakay buses are currently plying the EDSA Carousel route – from the Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange (PITX) to Monumento. Meanwhile, the two other buses are plying the Quiapo-Commonwealth Avenue route. The OVP said its buses are fully air-conditioned and equipped with necessities such as portable toilet, charging ports and free WiFi connection. On Wednesday, Vice President Sara Duterte will formally launch the PITX-Naic route of its Libreng Sakay program. “The new route will cater to passengers starting from Naic and seven other nearby towns in the province of Cavite all the way to the central terminal in Parañaque City,” the OVP said in a statement. As of July 31, the OVP’s Libreng Sakay program has served over 1.3 million passengers. — Neil Jayson Servallos",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines did not make any commitment to remove BRP Sierra Madre from Ayungin Shoal, the National Security Council said Tuesday after China renewed calls for the removal of the grounded vessel. China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs claimed Monday that Manila had promised “several times” to tow away BRP Sierra Madre—a rusty World War II-era ship that serves as the country’s outpost in the West Philippine Sea—“but has yet to act on it.” NSC spokesperson Jonathan Malaya, however, said this alleged commitment of the Philippines is a “figment of their imagination.” “The Philippines has not and will never agree to abandon its sovereign rights and jurisdiction over Ayungin Shoal,” Malaya said. In 1999, the Philippine Navy intentionally grounded BRP Sierra Madre at Ayungin Shoal to reinforce Manila’s sovereignty claim in the Spratly Islands. Ayungin Shoal is located within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone. Beijing claims the majority of the South China Sea, including parts that Manila calls the West Philippine Sea, as its own, using a “nine-dash line” on maps that an arbitration ruling in 2016 declared has no legal basis. Tensions between Manila and Beijing escalated again Saturday after the China Coast Guard blocked and fired water cannons at Philippine boats on a resupply mission for troops deployed on BRP Sierra Madre, preventing one of the charter boats from reaching Ayungin Shoal. The government condemned China’s maneuvers as dangerous and illegal. The Philippines has issued 445 diplomatic protests over Beijing’s presence and activities in the West Philippine Sea since 2020, the Department of Foreign Affairs said. China defended its coast guard’s actions, saying they were “professional, restrained and beyond reproach.” Intensified patrol The country’s coast guard will intensify maritime patrols in Ayungin shoal, Jay Tarriela, spokesperson of the PCG on WPS matters, told ABS-CBN News Channel Tuesday. “If there’s another resupply mission, we might probably add additional coast guard vessels to support the operation,” Tarriela said. He added that the PCG may deploy its larger vessels to support resupply missions. China’s coast guard, navy and maritime militia vessels routinely block or shadow Philippine patrol and supply boats.

That’s why I released the P265 million to make sure that phase of response is immediate, and people will have something to use for their needs immediately,” Marcos said in Filipino Wednesday. Broken down, the provinces of Davao del Norte, Davao Oriental, Agusan del Sur and Davao de Oro will each receive P30 million, while Surigao del Sur and Maguindanao del Sur will each be allocated P25 million. Davao City, Butuan City and Davao Occidental will each get P20 million, while Agusan del Norte is allotted P15 million. Cotabato and Bukidnon will each receive P10 million.

The Philippines moved to laxer mask rules after Cebu City issued an executive order in late August making face masks optional outdoors. The DOH said then that it was not yet time to lift the mask mandate but the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases later voted to recommend relaxing the rules, which President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. agreed to this week. READ: Marcos OKs voluntary use of masks outdoors \"I know that many feel it is not the right time but when will be the right time? There could be a worse variant, so let us prepare but let's not overcompensate with restrictions that may no longer be practical,\" Concepcion, a member of the president's Private Sector Advisory Council, said in a statement to media. Face masks will still be required indoors and in crowded area and Concepcion clarified that \"we are still encouraging the use of face masks outdoors, especially for those who are at high risk, like the elderly, the immunocompromised, and especially the unvaccinated.\" Citing data from an OCTA Research survey, Concepcion said 30% of Filipinos are seen to continue wearing masks even if the COVID-19 pandemic is delcared over and that many will still wear them outdoors even if doing so would be voluntary. \"How can you inspire confidence when if you go to a beach, you see everybody is still wearing a mask? How do you think foreign tourists will decide if they are made to choose between a destination that requires outdoor masking and one that does not?\" Concepcion said as he backed the easing of mask rules. \"Tourism is one of our biggest advantages. Our warmth, our smiling people are our assets. We should not lose this advantage. We have so many MSMEs, especially in the provinces, who rely on tourism.\" READ: Philippines extends COVID-19 state of calamity for emergency procurement, allowances While he acknowledged concerns raised by doctors, Concepcion said that Filipinos should now see COVID-19 \"like the flu.\" As of Monday, the Philippines had recorded 15,379 additional COVID-19 cases since the previous tally a week ago. The country’s average daily infections were at 2,197 from September 5 to 11.

Cristina Aldeguer-Roque. Prior to her appointment, Roque was DTI undersecretary for micro, small and medium enterprise (MSME) development. Last August, she was named acting DTI secretary following the resignation of Alfredo Pascual. Before CA members approved her appointment, Roque was grilled by lawmakers about the DTI’s plans to help small and medium enterprises and to protect consumers from substandard goods. Roque said the department has used artificial intelligence to activate its chatbot to answer consumers and entrepreneurs’ questions about buying quality products and starting a business. She also narrated to lawmakers how her family was able to set up clothing chain Kamiseta with just a small capital and make a profit after sound investments. Roque said her experience as an entrepreneur has instilled in her a profound understanding of the challenges faced by the country’s MSMEs and the vital role that government support plays in fostering the growth of these businesses. “The MSME is a sector we cannot ignore, being 99.5 percent of the business establishments and 60 percent of the labor force. Therefore, we need to ensure their development, as well as we must realize that they are the game changers of our economy,” she said. In pushing for MSME development, she said the DTI is promoting digitalization, diversification, franchising and improving access to financing.",

Go is among the sponsors and authors of the Regional Specialty Centers Act. “President Marcos’ support has been instrumental in bringing specialized medical care closer to our fellow Filipinos,” Go said. “No one should be left behind when it comes to health. Every Filipino has the right to quality medical services anywhere in the country,” he said. The law aims to create additional specialty centers in various regions to ensure that Filipinos have access to specialized medical services. “With the signing of this law, we are taking a giant leap in improving access to specialized medical care and bringing these services closer to Filipinos in need,” Go added. “Any one suffering from severe illnesses need not travel to Manila to avail themselves of medical care offered by specialty hospitals such as the Philippine Heart Center and Lung Center,” he said. The newly enacted law includes provisions for the establishment of specialty centers within existing government-controlled corporations or specialty hospitals. It outlines specific service capabilities that the Department of Health (DOH) will implement in regional hospitals. “By setting clear standards, we are ensuring that these specialty centers will have the necessary expertise and resources to cater to the patients’ needs effectively,” Go said. The law details the medical specialties that the DOH must prioritize in the establishment of these centers. Go thanked his fellow senators for crafting the law.",

Trade Secretary Cristina Roque told reporters that she will visit Japan this month as part of efforts to encourage more investments into the country. She said the government would also be bringing up the review of the Philippines-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement (PJEPA) during the trip to Japan. “We have to take that up also because there are some agricultural products that we want to push,” she said. The PJEPA, which entered into force in 2008, is the Philippines’ first bilateral free trade deal. Under the PJEPA, the FTA will be subject to review in 2011 and every five years thereafter. While a meeting for the FTA’s review was conducted in 2019, not much progress has been made. Earlier, Trade Undersecretary Allan Gepty said there is room to expand the PJEPA’s coverage. He said the FTA does not have provisions relating to sustainable development, environment, micro, small and medium enterprises, e-commerce or even circular economy, which are important in promoting sustainable trade. The PJEPA covers trade in goods, rules of origin, customs procedures, trade in services, investment, movement of natural persons, intellectual property, government procurement, competition, improvement of the business environment and cooperation. During the visit to Japan, Roque said she would push for investments in semiconductors, as well as retail. Apart from Japan, Roque is also set to fly to South Korea this month for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting.",

    "article_body": "JAKARTA – The Philippine embassy in Washington is arranging a possible visit by President Marcos to a West Coast city and Hawaii after his participation in the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meet in California in November. “Well, it’s going to be a very tight schedule again for the President because the (APEC) summit will actually start on Nov. 15 up to the 18th. And then the President plans to visit another city on the West Coast, and then from there possibly... maybe, we’re still trying to work out a short stay, a short visit to Honolulu,” Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez told reporters here last Tuesday. “But all of these schedules are being worked out,” he added. Romualdez said there is a large Filipino community in Hawaii, where Marcos and his family were exiled after the 1986 People Power revolution that abruptly ended the presidency of his late father and namesake. The administration of then president Corazon Aquino allowed the Marcoses to return to the Philippines in 1991. Marcos also wants to have “a lot of meetings” with potential investors, the ambassador said. “Whenever he goes, especially to the United States, there’s a lot of interest now in the Philippines, from many companies,” Romualdez added. According to the envoy, Silicon Valley tech companies are “very eager” to meet with the President, who has repeatedly cited the importance of digitalization in government transactions. “There’s also quite a number of requests from financial institutions. There are also companies in the manufacturing business in the West Coast, and probably a follow-up on the modular nuclear power plants that we’ve been talking about, and a number of companies that are based in the West Coast,” he added. Trudeau invites BBM Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau yesterday invited President Marcos to visit Canada next year to celebrate the 75th anniversary of diplomatic ties between their two countries. In a statement, the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) said Trudeau extended the invitation during his bilateral meeting with Marcos on the sidelines of the 43rd Association of Southeast Asian Nations Summit and Related Summits here. “Next year, we are celebrating 75 years of diplomatic relations… But the reality is the trade ties, economic ties between our countries continue to grow, the opportunities for investment, the flow of people back and forth as well,” the Canadian leader was quoted by the PCO as saying. Diplomatic relations between the Philippines and Canada started in 1949.",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Families displaced by last week’s magnitude 7.0 earthquake that shook Abra and other Northern Luzon areas are now starting to return to their homes. The number of persons staying inside evacuation centers is starting to go down, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction Management Council (NDRRMC). As of yesterday, only 989 families or a total of 3,319 individuals remained in some 30 temporary shelters in various affected areas. Latest data showed a continuing decrease in number from 40 evacuation centers taking care of 1,070 or 3,781 individuals last Monday. The NDRRMC said the number of affected families, however, has risen to 105,241 as of yesterday which translates to some 404,370 persons mostly from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). One week after the earthquake, the number of injured persons remained at 394 with 10 deaths and no more missing persons. The NDRRMC assured that clearing and relief operations continue as various national government agencies and local government units (LGUs) continue to assess damages. The office of Vice President Sara Duterte has sent relief supplies for those affected by last week’s earthquake in Abra. The OVP team, led by its Disaster Operations Center, delivered bottled waters, food packs, medicines and other supplies to the Abra Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office in Bangued for distribution to affected families. Volunteers from the Philippine Coast Guard, Philippine National Police-Abra and Inday Sara Duterte Ako Movement assisted in the delivery of the relief supplies. “Through the modest relief efforts of the Office of the Vice President, we would like to convey a clear and humble message to the good people of Abra – we are always with you. Abra has a special place in our hearts,” Duterte’s spokesperson Reynold Munsayac said. Meanwhile, volunteers of the Angat Buhay non-government organization of former vice president Leni Robredo distributed relief packs for weaving communities affected by the quake in La Paz and Peñarrubia in Abra and Caoayan in Ilocos Sur. Angat Buhay volunteers earlier turned over relief packs to the local government of Lagangilang, Abra for affected families. In Manila, the organization’s executive director Raffy Magno met with the Planet Water Foundation to explore ways to collaborate in programs that would provide clean water to partner communities, including the deployment of water filtration systems in disaster-hit areas. At least 700 persons affected by the earthquake in Northern Luzon have also received psychological first aid from Philippine Red Cross (PRC) volunteers. – Janvic Mateo, Emmanuel Tupas, Robertzon Ramirez, Pia Lee-Brago, Rudy Santos",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — After the sixth attack of the China Coast Guard on Philippine vessels on a resupply mission in the West Philippine Sea (WPS), a senator is recommending to the executive department the recall of the Philippine ambassador to China as a “high level of condemnation” for their continuous aggression. In an interview over dzBB, Sen. Francis Tolentino said recalling an ambassador does not mean severing diplomatic ties with China but merely a higher level of diplomatic protest. “The executive – President Marcos and the Department of Foreign Affairs will decide on this. They can recall our ambassador who is in Beijing to report to the DFA and the President and also to show that the level of violation of international law is too high and that it damages our right to WPS by the People’s Republic of China,” Tolentino noted. The Philippines’ man in Beijing is former journalist Jaime FlorCruz. “(The recall is a) high level of condemnation because the embassy will have no head of office. Although the embassy is still open, diplomatic relations are not severed or broken, this is still a hint at a high level diplomatic protest and will be noticed. I counted and we already have six violent incidents (in WPS),” he added. The senator was quick to explain that recalling ambassadors has basis as other countries have done so in the past, like Iran and its ambassador to Saudi Arabia in 2016. Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri said he “register my strong condemnation against the recent attack perpetrated by Chinese ships on Philippine vessels out on a resupply mission to the BRP Sierra Madre in its outpost in Ayungin Shoal.” “In this latest incident, we again see China as a bully: using size and brute strength to illegally encroach upon our EEZ (exclusive economic zone) and enforce a baseless right to drive away our protectors,” he said. “But water cannons and blockades will not dampen the will and resolve of our Navy and our Coast Guard to protect our exclusive economic zone in the West Philippine Sea.",

The #0711 healthline and One Health Command Center provides \"immediate attention\" and \"patient navigation\" as it facilitates patient referrals and caters to general health inquiries. \"Namugna nato ang usa ka call center nga diin maoy tawagan...(og) naay pasyente, asa ang bakante nga hospital, asa sila mo paingon aron dili magtapok sa usa (ka hospital) ang mga pasyente,\" Bernadas said during the Kapihan sa PIA yesterday. The healthline is connected to municipal, district, and provincial hospitals, as well as level 2 and 3 hospitals and its apex hospital: Vicente Sotto Memorial Medical Center. Bernadas also explained how the healthline works. By calling the #0711 service, the operator will be the one to contact the appropriate health facility where the patient will be directed. The operator will then schedule the patient to avoid a long wait and ensure they are correctly queued and properly attended to upon arrival at the health facility. \"Kon pananglitan naa siyay mga problema nga madala sa hospital, i-navigate nato ang pasyente nga ma-schedule siya didto sa mga hospitals nga asa siya paingon,\" Bernadas said. \"So motawag sila diha sa 711, ang 711 motawag sa hospital og asa siya paingon, ipa-schedule sila aron dili sila maghulat og dugay, makalinya sila og ensakto, ma antenderan sila og ensakto kon moadto na sila sa hospital,\" Bernadas added. Private hospitals are also included in the service as they have an established unit that monitors the healthline. Bernades said the deployment to public health facilities is free but private hospitals may include payment. On the other hand, the Health Referral System is the electronic system that facilitates coordination among healthcare providers to optimize the delivery of primary care services. \"(Kani para) makahibalo sila asa sila mo tawag, asa ang bakante nga hospital, ug asa ang appropriate hospital pinaagi sa atong refferal system ug pinaagi sa pagtawag sa 711,\" Bernadas said. Implemented in 2020, the healthline catered to COVID-19 cases during the peak of the pandemic. — Jonalyn Infante, CNU intern (FREEMAN)",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — About four to five million members of the Philippine Health Insurance Corp. were found to be already dead but still remain in its database, the PhilHealth president told the Senate yesterday. During the public hearing of the Senate committee on science and technology being chaired and presided over by Sen. Alan Peter Cayetano, Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. said the agency’s database is undergoing extensive cleaning after their system was hacked last week. Ledesma said they need the help of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) to fix their database for fear of using these names. He said about 92 percent of Filipinos are listed in PhilHealth. “The thing with the PhilHealth, database is my understanding is we have to clean it up because I think there are around four to five million people who have already passed away. They have not been removed from the database,” he added. Ledesma said he already asked the DICT and the Philippine Statistics Authority to help them in the cleaning of the PhilHealth database. He noted that Filipinos can easily register with PhilHealth. “Now, what I want to mention also is that there’s this thing called ‘point of care’ that makes it very easy for an individual to become a member,” he said. Cayetano conducted the public hearing anchored on the resolution of Sen. Mark Villar after around 13 to 20 million PhilHealth members’ names and information were leaked online following the recent cyberattack. Villar filed Resolution No. 811 before the Senate directing the appropriate committee to conduct an inquiry in aid of legislation over the cyberattack incident and all other attacks against government websites. “It is high time that we strengthen our cyberspace security as we are dealing with private and delicate information that could endanger, not just of one institution, but of the general Filipino public,” Villar said. “This attack is not just a big case of information theft. This is part of a massive attack against public health and welfare.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has approved the planned initial public offering (IPO) of renewable energy company Alternergy Holdings Corp. for up to P1.89 billion. Alternergy Holdings is a renewable energy holding company with a portfolio of investee companies with wind, solar, hydro, floating solar, and battery storage power projects. Led by former energy secretary Vince Perez, Alternergy has 67.24 megawatts (MW) of operating assets in wind and solar, with potential installed capacity of up to 1,368 MW of renewable energy. Alternergy said it would offer to the public up to 1.3 billion common shares priced at up to P1.48 per share.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Two alert list orders have been issued by the Bureau of Immigration (BI) against expelled Negros Oriental Rep. Arnolfo Teves Jr., who has been tagged as the brains in the assassination of former governor Roel Degamo. At a press briefing yesterday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla Jr. said the alert list orders are meant to restrict Teves’ movement and to facilitate his arrest through international cooperation. Remulla said BI officers were directed to report to the Philippine National Police (PNP) or National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) any information about Teves’ attempted entry or exit. Immigration personnel were also instructed to refer Teves to the PNP or NBI if they chance upon him at any port of entry. The orders, Remulla said, were based on a court warrant dated September 2023 and an Interpol “Blue Notice” published on Feb. 19. “Teves cannot escape the long arm of the law,” Remulla said. A Manila court has ordered the cancellation of Teves’ passport after the Anti-Terrorism Council designated him as terrorist. With his passport canceled, Teves can no longer travel to any country and will be made to return to the Philippines to face the charges filed against him in connection with the Degamo murder. Teves allegedly masterminded the killing of Degamo and 10 others. The expelled congressman is facing another complaint before the Department of Justice for allegedly financing terrorism. Teves has denied all the allegations hurled against him.",

    "date_published": "2023-07-22T19:13:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — After President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. lifted the state of public health emergency, Joey Concepcion, the founder of Go Negosyo, lauded the silver lining that emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. \"The pandemic brought the public and private sectors together. It showcased the formidable strength of government and industry joining forces to combat any adversity,\" Concepcion said. In the lead-up to Marcos' second State of the Nation Address, Concepcion emphasized that the collective effort between public and private sectors exemplifies the best of times for the country. Having served as the Presidential Adviser on Entrepreneurship under the previous administration, Concepcion became a prominent figure during the pandemic. Alongside the private sector, he spearheaded various initiatives, such as Project Ark, facilitating accessible mass testing, and orchestrating A Dose of Hope—a groundbreaking tripartite agreement to surmount bureaucratic barriers and provide vaccines. Concepcion also organized townhall meetings, ensuring the active involvement of medical professionals and scientists in shaping pandemic response policies. “Credit should go to the leadership of people like Secretary Ted Herbosa, Secretary Francisco Duque, Secretary Charlie Galvez, Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, Secretary Eduardo Ano, Secretary Dominguez, Secretary Nograles, Secretary Vince Dizon, Undersecretary Rosette, the doctors and scientists who were all ready to work with one another,” the Go Negosyo founder said. Concepcion also noted the collaborative efforts that brought the AstraZeneca vaccine to the Philippines. Through a unique partnership with the government, the private sector secured the vaccine at a special price and generously donated half of the acquired doses to the government. While the pandemic exacted a toll on lives and livelihoods, Concepcion said the positive shifts it triggered, particularly the accelerated digitalization across the nation. Filipinos embraced e-wallets for contactless transactions, fostering greater financial inclusion, and contributing to the country's robust economic rebound. With COVID-19 still a concern, Concepcion called for a continued focus on strengthening the healthcare sector and producing more nurses and healthcare professionals. As the world increasingly depends on Filipino nurses, the Philippines stands at the center of this vital opportunity to meet global demands. \"We must now strive to revitalize our economy, generate employment, and cultivate livelihood opportunities,\" Concepcion said.",

Marcos did not specifically state how much would be added to the Medal of Valor awardees’ monthly gratuity pay but described the increase as a way for the government to affirm its \"commitment to support and to honor our war heroes.\" The president also called on the AFP to \"remain relentless in countering lawless elements that intend to sow fear and distrust amongst our people.” “We shall continue to assert our rights in accordance with the Philippine constitution and international law,” he added. The Medal of Valor is the highest combat award given to military personnel who perform “a deed of personal bravery or self-sacrifice above and beyond the call of duty so conspicuously as to distinguish him above his comrades.” Marcos’ predecessor, former President Rodrigo Duterte, raised the monthly gratuity of Medal of Valor awardees in 2016 from P20,000 to P70,000. Last week, House Speaker Martin Romualdez told members of the AFP during a House-AFP fellowship event that the lower chamber \"stands beside you\" and will continue to show \"strong support\" for soldiers.

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Secretary Rex Gatchalian of the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) ordered the immediate recall of the reportedly “expired” canned tuna which became part of the agency’s family food packs and sent samples to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for testing. Gatchalian recalled the tuna after some of those who received them in Oriental Mindoro complained that they could not eat it because of foul smell. The May 5 report of DSWD in Region 4B, covering Mindoro, Marinduque, Romblon and Palawan, showed the complaints range from having “unacceptable and unusual taste” to being “unpalatable” and “smells like rotten eggs.” Gatchalian noted that the FDA will serve as the “third party that will determine whether the canned tuna is safe for the consumption of DSWD beneficiaries.” The FDA route was upon the recommendation of the fact-finding board that Gatchalian created for purposes of verifying reports that the canned tuna had been contaminated prior to distribution in the Mimaropa region. Initial feedback gathered by the Mimaropa field office indicated several complaints against Ocean’s Best Tuna from DSWD beneficiaries from the City of Calapan and the municipalities of Naujan, Bulalacao and Roxas. Gatchalian reiterated that the Ocean’s Best Tuna products were not expired but the FDA tests will validate if the expiry date stamped on the cans correspond to the tuna flakes’ quality. During a fact-finding meeting, it was found that the DSWD’s stockpile of canned tuna was not expired, as samples of the canned goods showed that its expiration is in 2025, or a good two years from the present year. “The FDA test will also determine if the expiration date stamped on the cans really corresponds to the state and quality of the tuna flakes inside cans,” DSWD spokesman Rommel Lopez pointed out. The agency claimed it was “unfortunate that Ocean’s Best Tuna, one of the items included in the DSWD’s Family Food Packs, has been the subject of numerous complaints from recipients and beneficiaries.” “The DSWD secretary also directed concerned officials to study all options including sanctions on the supplier, withholding of payment and even blacklisting from the list of accredited suppliers,” it added. “The DSWD will wait for the results of the FDA tests as this will determine objectively and scientifically whether the questioned canned tuna flakes are really safe for the consumption of the beneficiaries or not,” Lopez said. “Until we have the full report of the FDA, we cannot categorically say if the complaints were due to taste preference or if there is really contamination in the cans of Ocean’s Best Tuna,” he added.",

    "article_body": "Kudos to all local chief executives in the Province of Cebu, in particular to Governor Gwendolyn Garcia, for they have shown their mettle to help find the best solution to stop the spread of COVID-19. They deserve to be commended for a job well done at the height of the health crisis in the country. Governor Garcia's hardline stance with regard to the protocols to be followed as preventive measures against the deadly virus pushed her to be at loggerheads with the national government for quite some time. But, in the end, it was through her prudence and wise decision that made her different and unique from the rest of the local officials who preferred to remain silent or just contented with adhering to written health protocols sans outside-of-the-box thinking if the same would really make a difference in controlling the spread of the virus. The national government under the leadership of our new president, Bongbong Marcos, seems to be in control of our country's current state of health, even to the point of encouraging our people to get themselves vaccinated for protection against COVID-19. A significant number of Filipinos even got their booster shots to make them fully protected from the virus. Cooperation really helps in any kind of endeavor. The health crisis that is still battering the world has turned many people's lives into a miserable state; it has caused great damage to the economic system of many countries beyond one's expectation. Many people lost their jobs and stayed at home during the lockdown, relying only on the government's financial assistance for survival. The world, the government, and the people are really unimaginably in shambles. With the help and guidance of the Divine Providence and strengthened by the government's unwavering resolve to bravely confront the health crisis, the demise of the deadly virus is now in the offing. And yes, because of the people's cooperation and willingness to get themselves vaccinated on days allotted to them, the campaign was a huge success, so to speak. As a result, the national government hit the targeted percentage of people being inoculated. Herd immunity against the deadly virus is no longer an impossible thing to achieve, based on the percentage of the people who already got their jabs. And with the people fully protected against the virus' intrusion, it won't be long the virus shall die a natural death. Joselito S. Berdin Lapu-Lapu City",

    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — House Deputy Majority Leader Janette Garin has advised women not to use underwear at home this summer to avoid contracting fungal infections. Garin, former secretary of the Department of Health, said women are prone to fungal infections, due to the nature of their “intimate area.” “It’s not a sexually transmitted disease. It is due to the women’s natural flora in the intimate area… in the perineal area of women,” Garin yesterday said. She said that when this area gets wet because of sweat, it becomes a “perfect petri dish” for fungi to grow. “The candida albicans in the skin will multiply and becomes itchy. The more you scratch, the more it will itch. You should not scratch it,” she said, referring to the naturally occuring fungus in the body. Garin said that while the condition is curable, it is important to keep a woman’s intimate area dry. She asked the public not to put malice on her advice. Meanwile, Health Secretary Ted Herbosa said women need not go “commando” this summer to avoid getting yeast infection. Herbosa made the statement during a Senate committee hearing yesterday, wherein he was asked to comment on Garin’s advice. “That advice is usually for candidiasis,” Herbosa said, referring to the vaginal fungal infection. “Wearing cotton underwear is an option if you don’t want to go commando, because it also does not trap moisture,” he added. While there is nothing wrong with not wearing underwear to keep cool, a better alternative is to wear cotton underpants, according to women health undersecretaries present in the hearing. “I frequent my ob-gynecologists and she recommends cotton underwear for women,” Health Undersecretary Emmie Perez-Chion said. “Aside from using cotton underwear, we have feminine wash that also prevents the development of fungal infection,” Health Undersecretary Maria Francia Laxamana said. Herbosa said that unlike women, men are not as susceptible to fungal infections, because both sexes have different ph levels in their genital areas. FDA issues warning on sunblock cream The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned the public against buying and using an unnotified sunblock cream. In an advisory, the FDA said the Perfect Skin All Naturals Sunblock Gel Cream SPF 45 has not been issued a valid certificate of product notification. It said the use of the product could pose health risks to consumers. “Since the unnotified cosmetic product did not go through the notification process of the FDA, the agency cannot assure their quality and safety,” the FDA said. — Marc Jayson Cayabyab, Rhodina villanueva",

    "date_published": "2024-06-18T18:28:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — New documents obtained by Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian indicate that suspended Bamban Mayor Alice Guo first entered the Philippines when she was already a teen, contrary to her claim and her birth certificate that she was born in Tarlac. The documents Gatchalian sent to reporters came from the Board of Investments from the Guo family's application for Special Investors Resident Visa (SIRV) and the Bureau of Immigration. Gatchalian said the embattled mayor \"might be Guo Hua Ping, who entered the Philippines on Jan. 12, 2003 when she was 13 years old.\" To recall, in May, social media users noted an article on World News, a Chinese-language newspaper based in Binondo, Manila, that said Guo is also known as \"Guo Huaping, the daughter of Mr. Guo Jianjiang of Chaodai Village, Jinjing Town, Jinjiang City, Fujian Province.\" RELATED: Chinese language newspaper celebrating Alice Guo’s mayoral victory earns buzz The senator said the documents show that Guo's real birth date is Aug. 31, 1990, and not July 12, 1986, as stated in her official birth certificate. One document sent by Gatchalian is a photocopy of a passport with the name \"GUO HAPING.\" The place of birth indicated in the passport is Fujian, China, with the date of birth being Aug. 31, 1990. In the document labelled SIRV, Guo Haping's nationality was stated as Chinese. Gatchalian also pointed out that similar to the findings his office earlier gathered, Guo Huaping's registered mother is named \"Lin Wenyi.\" These allegations all add to the confusion that has surrounded the real identity of the Bamban mayor, who earlier on Tuesday called for a fair investigation into the accusations against her in a letter sent to Malacañang. The letter, submitted by her legal representatives, states that Guo's name has been \"dragged unfairly\" after a series of Senate hearings that sought to clarify her links to the POGO hub recently raided in Bamban, Tarlac. On Monday, the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission said it had gathered enough evidence to file a human trafficking case against Guo. For Gatchalian, these new documents could strengthen the filing of a quo warranto case against the Bamban mayor. In the letter sent by Guo's camp to Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, Guo asserted her innocence and denied all accusations against her related to human trafficking, kidnapping and money laundering. Guo also said in the letter that her shortcomings are due to a \"lack of knowledge\" and not intentional wrongdoing.",

    "date_published": "2024-05-31T00:00:00+08:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Justice (DOJ) is only waiting for the Timor-Leste Court of Appeals to decide on Manila’s request for extradition of expelled lawmaker Arnolfo Teves Jr. The country’s extradition request has passed through “first screening” at the Timor-Leste Ministry of Justice, DOJ spokesman Mico Clavano said at a press conference. “The (Timor-Leste) Court of Appeals will decide whether to deport, extradite or transfer former Congressman Teves back to the Philippines,” he added. The deadline for a decision by the Court of Appeals is set on June 20 but the decision could be released earlier than the scheduled date, according to Clavano. For the part of the Philippine government, Clavano said they are “ready” and will execute the decision of the Timor-Leste government as soon as the latter has decided on the request. Teves was arrested in East Timor while playing golf at the Top Golf Driving Range and Bar in March. He is facing murder charges over the assassination of Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo on March 4, 2023. He is also facing several other charges in connection with a series of killings in 2019. Transfer of Quiboloy cases The camp of pastor Apollo Quiboloy, meanwhile, is planning to ask the Supreme Court (SC) to reconsider the transfer of his cases from Davao City to Quezon City. The SC earlier granted the request of the DOJ to transfer Quiboloy’s child and sexual abuse cases to “avoid the miscarriage of justice.” In its administrative order released on Tuesday, the SC Second Division said they “found compelling reasons to justify the transfer of venue as the cases involve public interest.” The SC also cited Quiboloy’s influence in Davao City, which could “cause local biases and a strong possibility that witnesses cannot freely testify due to fear and influence of the accused.” In explaining their plan to file a petition for the reversal of the SC order, Quiboloy’s lawyer Israelito Torreon said there may have been “a violation of due process” as they never heard about the matter. He added that the order may even be interpreted as “an attack on the judiciary” as it was based on unsubstantiated claims of bias in Davao City courts. “It was decided based only on the unfounded and unsubstantiated claims of bias in Davao City courts which, if analyzed properly, may actually constitute a slight on the local courts in Davao City,” Torreon said. “(It) may be interpreted as an attack on the judiciary as a whole as such claims tend to diminish the confidence of the public on our judicial system just because of locational concerns,” he added. Tarreon also noted that the transfer of case would “add a great burden” to the six accused because of the” financial costs, hassles and inconvenience that will ensue upon them.” “However, if they (SC) will stick to their ruling then we will, of course, abide,” he added. For her part, SC spokesperson Camille Ting said the Office of the Court Administrator dispensed some of the requirements on the transfer of cases “in view of the urgent nature of the request and the involvement of public interest,” according to GMA News. Aside from his cases in Davao City, Quiboloy is facing the non-bailable offense of qualified human trafficking before a Pasig City court.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. on Tuesday said nearly 680,000 families have “achieved self-sufficiency” after graduating from the government’s Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps). Under the 4Ps, a program signed into law in 2019, marginalized families will receive incentives to ensure that they will send their children to school and provide them with proper nutrition. Last year, more than 4 million households received support through the 4Ps. “Since its inception, nearly 678,000 families have achieved self-sufficiency,” Marcos Jr. said during the Department of Social Welfare and Development’s (DSWD) 74th anniversary celebration. ADVERTISEMENT “More than a million high school students have graduated, nearly 470,000 elementary school children have completed their primary education... Ibig pong sabihin, kaya na nila na itaguyod ang kanilang sarili dahil may kumpiyansa at pag-asa sila para sa mas maliwanag na kinabukasan,” he added. Some 40,000 4Ps beneficiaries have “passed their licensure examinations and 65 of them stood out—earning spots among the top examinees in their respective fields,” the President said. Despite these achievements, Marcos Jr. underscored that the country needs to do more than just providing monetary needs and incentives to the needy. “We know that progress requires more than just assistance,” he said. “It demands that opportunities be built so that they may earn and they may grow,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT Under the government’s policy, 4Ps beneficiaries are offered training sessions from the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to help them find another source of income. Marcos Jr. also congratulated the DSWD for its decades-long service, and urged the agency to “remain vigilant against modern challenges such as climate change,” noting that “natural disasters are growing more frequent, more severe, leaving communities at greater risk.” “Your vision is simple and profound: to build a resilient, inclusive society where no one is left behind... Lasting change is not built overnight—it takes consistent, and honest, and dedicated effort,” he said. “Every single centavo spent, every program that is implemented, every decision that has been made must serve a very clear purpose: to create opportunities that endure, that uplift, and reach far beyond just today,\" he added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Vice President Sara Duterte on Tuesday claimed her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was arrested ahead of the 2025 midterm elections to temper the growing support for senatorial candidates allied with their family. The former president was arrested in the Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) after he arrived from Hong Kong, where he and Partido Demokratiko Pilipino (PDP) senatorial candidates met with overseas Filipino workers. “Ngayon dahil lumalakas yung PDP bloc voting of 9 candidates, tatanggalin nila si President Duterte,” the Vice President told reporters in a chance interview outside the Villamor Air Base. “Some sort of kidnapping, parang ganiyan na nangyayari. All because mukhang matatalo sila sa midterm elections dahil ang lakas ng vote straight sa candidates ng PDP,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT “I warned you about the budget… I’m warning all of you about election cheating,” she said. The Vice President further claimed that her father’s allegedly unlawful arrest may also be linked to the 2028 national elections, where she has long been rumored to vie for the presidency. But the younger Duterte clarified that she has yet to decide if she would actually run for the Philippines’ highest post in the next presidential elections. “Hindi pa yan yung iniisip natin ngayon,” she said. “Ang iniisip natin ngayon hindi dapat makaalis si President Duterte sa Pilipinas. ADVERTISEMENT Kung pipilitin man ng gobyerno… paano natin siya mapapabalik? ‘Yun lang muna yung aasikasuhin and of course yung pangangampaniya ng 9 candidates ng PDP,” she said. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. denied allegations that his predecessor’s arrest was part of politicking ahead of the upcoming midterm elections. “The government is just doing its job. It’s not because it is one person or another that we do the things that we do,” Marcos Jr. told reporters in a press conference in Malacañang. “Maybe noon sa mga nakaraang administrasyon ganoon, ang ginagawa pero sa akin hindi ganoon,” he said. The President emphasized that charges of crimes against humanity have been filed against his predecessor as early as 2017, when the Philippines was still a member of the ICC. ADVERTISEMENT “It was during the time of former President Duterte. I don’t see why that can be political persecution on my part because it was initiated even before I came to the picture,” Marcos Jr. said. “Civilian pa ako noong nangyari ito, wala pa ako. This is an evolution of his case so this is where we ended up,” he said. Duterte’s arrest is linked to the numerous extrajudicial cases committed under his administration’s crackdown on illegal drugs that saw thousands of drug suspects — including minors and bystanders — killed during police operations.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) chief Brig. Gen. Nicolas Torre III on Monday said he planned to file a cyber libel complaint against former broadcaster Jay Sonza and another vlogger for allegedly spreading false information that he had been hospitalized. Torre confirmed that the complaint was ready to be submitted to the Department of Justice (DOJ) at any time. “‘Yong mga nag-post na ako’y na-ospital, na ako’y nagkasakit, I am going to file cyber libel case against them kasi ang tinatamaan kasi ang pamilya ko eh,” Torre said. (Those who posted that I was hospitalized, that I got sick, I am going to file a cyber libel case against them because it’s my family that’s being affected.) ADVERTISEMENT “It’s really a foul,\" he added. The CIDG chief said that he was never ill and said that the photos circulating, showing him in a hospital, had been manipulated. “Hindi nila puwede sabihin na joke only kasi ‘yan ang nangyayari eh. Ang galing magsalita pero kapag tinanong mo na sa Kongreso, ide-deny na... Hindi puwedeng ganon,” he said. (They can’t just say it was a joke because that’s the problem. They’re good at talking, but when you ask them in Congress, they deny it. Then, the worst part is they say it was ‘just a joke.’ That’s not acceptable.) Earlier, Torre also filed an inciting to sedition complaint before the DOJ against former Philippine Army captain Clemente “Dado” Enrique. Torre accused Enrique of making seditious statements while he was still serving as the Davao Regional Commander during the execution of an arrest warrant for Kingdom of Jesus Christ leader Pastor Apollo Quiboloy.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Armed Forces of the Philippines on Saturday said the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group has been \"reorganized\" as part of efforts to streamline the military that started in February. In a release, the AFP said the vice president's security unit had not been disbanded but had been reorganized into the AFP Security and Protection Group to \"unify security and protection operations.\" It said the reorganization \"ensures the continued, uninterrupted, and robust protection of the vice president within a more integrated and optimized framework.\" The AFP announced the designation and activation of the Vice Presidential Security and Protection Group in June 2022, an expansion of the Vice Presidential Security Detachment, to provide security for then Vice President-elect Sara Duterte. ADVERTISEMENT The AFP said Saturday that the streamlining process was approved by the Department of Defense, which also approved the activation of the VPSPD in 2022. The military said Saturday that the Security and Protection Battalion had provided security to vice presidents of the Philippines prior to June 2022. It said the reorganized setup would be a \"more efficient and effective way\" of protecting Duterte and the future vice presidents. The AFP said it remains \"fully committed\" to protecting the vice president and other government officials. It also appealed to Filipinos to \"avoid spreading false or misleading information.\" ADVERTISEMENT \"We enjoin our kababayans to use our communications platforms to promote unity, peace, and understanding, and not to sow discord, hatred, and division,\" it said. In December 2024, Vice President Duterte told the AFP after the recall of some members of her security detail that she would not accept replacements. This came after Gen. Romeo Brawner Jr, AFP chief of staff, announced the temporary replacement of some VPSPG personnel whom the Philippine National Police were investigating in relation to alleged assassination threats made by Duterte against the President, First Lady, and House speaker during an online briefing on Nov. 23, 2024. “So kung magtanggal sila, hindi na nila i-replace. Iwan na lang nila yung maiwan and kung wala man maiwan dahil tatanggalin nila lahat,” Duterte said. (If they recall anyone, they shouldn't send replacements. Just leave the people who will be retained and if nobody will be left, then recall everyone)",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Members of the Filipino community in Washington state in the US are calling on the Philippine Consulate General in San Francisco to lay out concrete steps it is taking to assist Filipinos facing deportation and other immigration issues. In an open letter, Migrante Seattle and Migrante sa University of Washington Medical Center said it would bring these issues to the consulate general’s outreach activity in Washington state this weekend. “Within the past few months, there has been an increase in the number of Filipino migrants detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Washington state has one of the largest detention centers in the country, and Filipinos here know intimately the inhumane conditions of these facilities,” they said. They said detained Filipinos they visited “reported little to no response from the Philippine Consulate” and had only been given “empty promises or redundant advice to hire legal support after weeks of voicemails.” ADVERTISEMENT The groups said they would press the consulate general to give concrete steps on assisting Filipinos already detained as well as those who have been deported or repatriated. “What is the plan to reach out to all registered OFWs, Filipino nationals, and their families here in [Washington State] to inform them of their rights and what the [consulate general] can do to support them?“ Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez said in January that the US had deported 24 Filipinos by then, with around 80 more set to be sent back to the Philippines. The Department of Foreign Affairs that month also advised Filipinos in the United States to stay “low key” and work on legalizing their stay to avoid deportation amid the Trump administration’s fresh crackdown on illegal migrants. “‘Yung mga overstaying Filipinos… maybe it is best to be low profile and not join rallies,” Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega said in a news forum then. ADVERTISEMENT The Philippine Embassy in the United States also put up 24/7 hotlines for Filipinos and stressed that all Filipinos in the US have rights regardless of their immigration status. The deportations were initially thought to target undocumented foreign nationals in the US but has also led to the detention and repatriation of nationals there legally. “Our overseas compatriots, the Philippines’ ‘new heroes’, deserve timely, meaningful, and concrete support from our government,” Migrante Seattle and Migrante sa University of Washington Medical Center said in their open letter. “The Philippine government does not get to force us to carry the Philippine economy and then turn their backs on us in our time of need,” they also said. “What we in Migrante want from our consulate and government is simple. We want to ensure the well-being, rights, and welfare of our kababayan, especially those who are trafficked and in detention, are seriously and diligently addressed,” they also said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) – Malacañang on Thursday urged candidates of the 2025 midterm polls to promote integrity, respect, and truthfulness in campaigning for the upcoming polls. This, as the Palace slammed as unacceptable the recent misogynistic and insensitive remarks made by several local bets during their campaigns. Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said that while making such sexist or derogatory comments were accepted and had even been applauded in the past, such remarks will not fly with the Marcos administration. “Paano nga ba na ang ganitong klaseng pananalita noon ay pinapalakpakan? Parang pinagbubunyi ang mga kandidato o mga lider na nagsasalita ng walang karespe-respeto lalong-lalo na sa mga kababaihan? Ipinagmamalaki at ginagawang katatawanan, ginagawang joke ang pangbababae ng mga kalalakihan. Ginagawa ring issue at katatawanan ang rape na sitwasyon,” Castro said in a Palace briefing. ADVERTISEMENT “Hindi na po ito dapat. Hindi dapat gawing idolo ang ganitong klaseng tao. Hindi ito dapat pamarisan, hindi dapat pinapalakpakan. Kung ginawa ito dati at pinapalakpakan hindi na ito sa administrasyon ni Pangulong Marcos na dapat ito mangyari. Kaya ayon sa Pangulo, hindi katanggap tanggap ang mga kandidato na ganito ang naratibo sa kanilang pangangampanya,” she continued. While the Palace official refused to mention any names, she was clearly referring to former President Rodrigo Duterte whose numerous sexist and derogatory comments against women had repeatedly landed him in hot water during his term. “Dapat mapanatili ng bawat isa, bawat kandidato lalong lalo na ng mga kandidato na nagnais na maging lider ng bansa, dapat ipagpatuloy nila ang pagpromote ng respeto, ng integridad, ng truthfulness sa kanilang sinasabi, habang sila ay nagbibigay ng mga pangako sa kanilang mga constituents at mga botante,” Castro said. In a statement, former senator Leila de Lima criticized the “degrading remarks” of Rep. Ruwel Peter Gonzaga, who is running for governor in Davao de Oro. De Lima – a target of mysoginistic remarks during the Duterte administration – described Gonzaga’s statements during his campaign as “vulgar and misogynistic” that “reflects a dangerous mindset.” ADVERTISEMENT “His sexist ‘jokes’ are not merely inappropriate—they are symptomatic of a broken political culture that continues to treat women as objects, not as equal citizens. This is not just about words. This is about power—and how some choose to abuse it,” De Lima said. “Leadership is not about drawing laughs from a crowd—it’s about drawing the line between what is right and what is wrong. It’s about protecting those who are often unheard, unseen, and unrepresented,” she added. De Lima urged the gubernatorial candidate to issue an apology and respect women. The Commission on Elections earlier issued a show-cause order against Gonzaga and three other candidates to explain the remarks made during their campaign. The Palace meanwhile commended Comelec for immediately taking action against erring candidates.",

Zaw Htun, AFP MANILA — The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Thursday confirmed the death of a second Filipino from a devastating earthquake in Myanmar. The agency said it was \"informed by the Philippine Embassy in Yangon of the positive identification of the remains of a second confirmed Filipino victim of the powerful 7.7 earthquake which hit Myanmar last March 28.\" \"The family of the deceased Filipino has been informed. They have requested media to respect their privacy in this very difficult time,\" the agency said. ADVERTISEMENT \"Out of respect for the wishes of the family, the Department is unable to provide any further details,\" it added. Two Filipinos remained unaccounted for in Mandalay, Myanmar, the DFA said. The agency on Wednesday confirmed that another Filipino fatality in the Myanmar quake had been identified. Last month's tremor razed thousands of homes, schools and monasteries in Myanmar’s central belt. Junta spokesman Zaw Min Tun said on Tuesday evening that 148 people remained missing from the March 28 quake as fatalities hit 3,645, with 5,017 people injured. ADVERTISEMENT The earthquake has compounded the economic woes of the country gripped by a civil war since the military seized power in a 2021 coup. With the junta at the helm, Myanmar has become internationally isolated and sanctioned while its territory has split into areas controlled by the military, anti-coup guerillas and ethnic armed factions. Half the population of 51 million live in poverty while more than 3.5 million people are displaced.",

DMW Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac said several countries have taken note of recent mass actions and are currently monitoring the activities of Filipino communities. “So, mag-ingat lang po – doble, triple ingat at sundin ang patakarang batas ng host country,” Cacdac said in a televised briefing. Malacanang earlier announced that the Qatari government will no longer file charges against the 17 Filipinos arrested last month following their provisional release a few days ago. ADVERTISEMENT “So, their lives will hopefully—of the 17, will hopefully be back to normal, they can move on, learn from this incident, kasi alam naman natin na sa mga kababayan natin kailangan talagang sumunod sa regulation from host country, lalo na sa aspeto ng mass actions or assembly. Dito sa Qatar, nagkaroon ng arrest pero hindi naman kailangan humantong sa arrest para maging maingat, ‘di ba,” Cacdac said. Malacañang earlier said the cases against 17 Filipinos who were arrested in Qatar for participating in a recent illegal assembly have been dismissed, after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. directly talked to Qatari ambassador to the Philippines Ahmed Saad Al-Homidi to resolve the problem. Unauthorized public demonstrations are illegal under Qatar's law and gatherings and protests require approval from the government. Three of the 20 arrested Filipinos were still minors and were the first to be released. The other members of the group were given provisional release last week.",

He said this before the beneficiaries of the Comprehensive Social Benefits Program at the Armed Forces of the Philippines headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City, Wednesday. The president said he was saddened upon learning the untimely release of benefits due to “complicated” documentary requirements. “Kaya’t nagtanong po ako at tinatanong ko sa kanila, ‘Ito bang mga benepisyo na ating ipinapangako sa mga nagseserbisyo para sa atin ito ba ay nabibigay nang tama? Ito ba ay nabibigay nang mabilis?’ Eh medyo nalungkot ako dahil ang sagot, ‘Hindi pa. Hindi ba naibigay,’” Marcos Jr. said in his speech. ADVERTISEMENT “Sabi nila sa akin ay masyado kasing mahaba ang proseso. Mahaba ang – at saka kumplikado ang mga documentary requirements at kung ano-ano. Ika ko, ‘Hindi siguro tama ‘yan,’” he added. The commander-in-chief said the benefits due to the families would be expedited by streamlining the processes. “Kaya’t ang aming ginawa ay sabi ko kami na, tayo na ang magbuo ng mga dokumento. Tayo na ang mag-ayos ng kanilang mga pangangailangan upang maging mas makabuluhan ang ating selebrasyon sa Araw ng Kagitingan, upang mas mabibigyan ng kahulugan ang ating ginagawa ngayong araw na ito. Dapat sa araw na ito maibigay na natin,” he added. Sixty-two beneficiaries attended the ceremony, including families of uniformed personnel from AFP, Philippine National Police, Philippine Coast Guard, and Bureau of Fire Protection who were killed in action or during operations. They will receive P500,000 in two tranches. Another P100,000 was given to the beneficiaries by the Office of the President during the event. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, AFP Deputy Chief of Staff LtGen. Rommel Roldan recognized the gallantry and sacrifice of uniformed personnel in safeguarding national security. “The role of every uniformed personnel is crucial. It is indispensable. It is through their valor, dedication, and quiet resolve that our republic stands strong,” he said. He also assured assistance to the men in uniform and their families. “It is an affirmation of our ongoing commitment to stand by our troops and their families not only in battle but even beyond it,” he stated.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on Monday inked a memorandum of agreement to provide a P10,000-cash aid for indigents who need to finance their transportation and other needs when tending to their legal cases. Those who would qualify for the “Client Referral and Psychosocial Intervention Program” could use the P10,000 aid for transportation to and from courthouses, meals when attending a hearing, and other expenses related to their cases and legal proceedings. “Ang kulang talaga namin dito na kayang punuan ng DSWD ay yung budgetary support na kinakailangan para masuportahan natin yung victims,” Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said. “Kapag nalagay ka sa isang kasong katulad nito at maging biktima, halos tumitigil ang buhay at mundo kaya kinakailangan silang suportahan,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Kapag hindi nagsama ang DSWD at ang DOJ, parang yung kawawa lalong nakakawawa. Wala silang pamasahe man lang o pangtustos sa anuman ang kanilang pangangailangan,” he added. DSWD Secretary Rex Gatchalian described the partnership between the two agencies as “a true pursuit of social justice.” “[We are] recognizing the need of individuals in crisis for psychosocial assistance to help them recover with what they are going through,” Gatchalian said. “When those in crisis are unable to pursue justice, they are also denied of the opportunity to develop their full capacity in other aspects in their life,” he said. Crime victims who do not have the means to fund their legal needs may go to a DOJ action center, where they will undergo an assessment to see if they are qualified to receive the DSWD’s funding support. ADVERTISEMENT Those who will receive the cash aid may reapply for another P10,000 fund after 3 months, said Joanne Carla Guevarra, Assistant State Prosecutor at the DOJ Action Center. “First time po ito kaya medyo kinakabahan kami na baka biglang dumugin. Tatanggapin po namin talaga, but subject po sa assessment. Indigents po yung tunay naming target kasi sila po yung nangangailangan,” she said. “We’re hoping na kapag gumugulong na itong programa ay mabigyan ng additional budget si DSWD because this is a very new partnership,” she said. So far, DSWD action centers are located in Metro Manila, Ilocos, Central Luzon, Bicol, Central Visayas, Northern Mindanao and Davao. The DOJ is working to open up more action centers in other regions, Guevarra said.",

Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said chartering the flight was part of extending assistance to the International Criminal Police Organization, Interpol, in serving the International Criminal Court warrant on the former president. \"Sabi nga po natin, 'pag hiningi po ang assistance siyempre po dapat kumpleto po, dahil kung wala naman pong ipo-provide na sasakyan para madala po ang dating pangulo sa ICC, eh parang hindi rin po naging kumpleto ang pagtugon natin sa ating commitment to the Interpol,\" she said at a press briefing. (As we said, if they ask for assistance, we should give complete support. Without that airplane to bring the former president to the ICC, it would be like an incomplete response to our commitment to Interpol) ADVERTISEMENT Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla earlier Friday said that the Philippine government paid for the flight. Castro, when asked about how much the charter cost the government, said she did not have complete information to comment on that. \"Maaari po siguro ay hindi ko agad masasabi, kung meron man po ah, dahil meron pong kaugnayan ito sa isang pribadong korporasyon,\" she also said. (It may be that I cannot say right now because it may involve a private corporation) A Gulfstream G550 jet carrying Duterte landed at Rotterdam-The Hague Airport on March 13, 2025 following his arrest for charges of crimes against humanity before the ICC.

Palace Press Officer Undersecretary Claire Castro made the statement as Manibela began on Monday its 3-day transport strike to protest the LTFRB’s alleged misrepresentation of data regarding the PUV modernization program. “Ang hiling lamang po natin at hiling din po ni Secretary Vince Dizon, makipag-usap muna po sana ang pamunuan ng Manibela dahil tandaan po natin, hindi lamang po ang pamahalaan ang maaaring magkaroon ng … kumbaga, iyong impact ay hindi lamang po sa pamahalaan kung hindi mismo sa mga commuters. Alalahanin po natin, ang mga commuters ay inosente po at nalalagay lamang po sa gitna,” Castro said. “Ang nais po ni Secretary Vince Dizon ay mag-usap po at ibigay nila sa bagong liderato po ng DOTr kung ano po iyong ninanais nila. Sana huwag na po nating madamay ang mga commuters dito.” According to Malacañang, initial reports showed that the effects of the transport strike to commuters had so far been minimal, noting that authorities provided free rides to stranded commuters. ADVERTISEMENT “Sa aking pagkakaalam, sa ngayong kasalukuyan ay hindi pa naman po apektado iyong mga commuters natin lalu’t lalo na po na talaga naman pong handa ang ating pamahalaan, ang administrasyon na tumulong sa anumang puwedeng maging inconvenience sa mga commuters,” she said. Castro meanwhile said that the government would revisit its earlier data on the PUV modernization program. “Aaralin po natin ngayon iyan, kung 43%, at hihikayatin po natin na lahat ng maaaring mangyari ay pabor sa commuters, pabor din po sa mga jeepney operators at drivers. Lahat po ay dapat win-win solution po tayo,” she said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Bureau of Immigration has found and taken into its custody Na Ikhyeon, a South Korean fugitive whom three of its staff helped escape last week, it said Sunday morning. Na had been hiding in a residential area in Angeles City in Pampanga and was arrested through the joint efforts of BI’s Fugitive Search Unit and Intelligence Division, city and regional police units, the Philippine National Police Intelligence Group and naval intelligence. Authorities also arrested Kang Changboem, who authorities said helped Na escape. South Korean police have since confirmed that Kang is also wanted in South Korea for fraud. The two will be brought to the BI detention facility in Camp Bagong Diwa in Taguig and, the bureau said, \"special arrangements will be made to ensure heightened security, as they are now tagged as high-risk detainees with intent to escape.\" ADVERTISEMENT The bureau said last Wednesday that Na is wanted in Korea for his alleged involvement in deceptive investments and misleading his fellow Koreans by directing them to invest in non-existent accounts. He was arrested in May 2023 but his deportation had been deferred pending the resolution of an estafa case against him at the Quezon City Prosecutor’s Office. Na slipped BI custody during a hearing last week, with the help of BI personnel. The bureau said last Wednesday they would also look into whether Na's lawyer was involved in the escape. \"The swift and decisive actions taken by the BI and the DOJ in this case demonstrate the unrelenting efforts of the agency to uphold justice and maintain the integrity of its operations,\" the BI said Sunday. In a related development, the BI also addressed the involvement of three employees in aiding Na’s escape, as shown in CCTV footage. ADVERTISEMENT Two of the employees, both contractual workers, were immediately terminated from the service. The case of a permanent employee was escalated to the Department of Justice, which also eventually led to dismissal. The BI has been plagued by corruption issues since in recent years, including a scheme where immigration officers would escort foreign nationals past passport screening at Ninoy Aquino International Airport. In recent months, it has been in the news for incidents of persons of interest in cases managing to slip out of the country. — from a report by Karen De Guzman, ABS-CBN News",

    "article_body": "Malacanang denied Tuesday that former presidential spokesman Harry Roque is a victim of political persecution after the latter faced arrest for evading a congressional inquiry on offshore gaming operators in the Philippines. Roque said Monday he would seek asylum in the Netherlands, where he has joined the legal team defending former President Rodrigo Duterte from crimes against humanity charges before the International Criminal Court. He told reporters the warrant of arrest issued by the House Quad Committee is “unjust prosecution\" against him. \"Dito sa Europa, unheard of 'yung may warrant of arrest na indefinite ang lifetime,\" he said. \"I am confident that I can prove political persecution through unjust prosecution.\" ADVERTISEMENT Speaking to TeleRadyo Serbisyo, Palace Press Officer and Undersecretary Claire Castro said Roque must prove that his allegations of political persecution are well founded before he is granted asylum. She noted that evidence showing Roque’s links to POGOs “just fell into the hands of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission” during its investigation into POGO operations. “Lahat ng ebidensya na nagpapakita diumano na siya ay involved sa POGO ay lumagpak lang sa kamay ng PAOCC. Nung sila ay nag imbestiga sa Lucky South 99, dun lang nakita ‘yung dokumento at lumabas ang pangalang Harry Roque,” she said. Lucky South 99, located in Porac, Pampanga, was raided by Philippine law enforcers last year due to suspected criminal activities such as human trafficking and torture. PAOCC Spokesperson Winston John Casio later revealed authorities found several documents bearing Roque’s signature during the raid. ADVERTISEMENT Roque was implicated in the POGO controversy for accompanying and helping Cassandra Li Ong, an official of Whirlwind and Lucky South 99 gaming firm, to pay off arrears totaling USD500,000. He has admitted, on record, to being a lawyer for Whirlwind, the company that is leasing its Porac compound to Lucky South 99. He has also admitted that he owns part of a corporation that owns a house in Tuba, Benguet where 2 foreign nationals were arrested over alleged visa violations. Roque has also evaded the QuadComm hearings and failed to submit subpoenaed documents include his Statements of Assets, Liabilities, and Net Worth and records connected to his family firm, Biancham Holdings, as well as a land transaction in Parañaque City. “Nung nagkaroon ng hearing sa QuadComm, siya mismo ang nagsabi na siya - ang mga dokumento niya kumpleto ito - may BIR, ‘yung auntie niya pinamanahan siya dapat may extrajudicial settlement of estate, BIR of course to prove na bayad ang estate tax, ‘yung SALN niya, lahat ito supposed to be hindi na dapat private,” Castro said. ADVERTISEMENT The Palace official said the Department of Justice has not discussed whether or not to contest Roque’s petition for asylum or even to revoke his passport. “Sa ngayon po, walang napapag-usapan tungkol kay Harry Roque,” she said. She said the Prosecutor's Office has yet to recommend the filing of human trafficking charges against Roque.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Lawyers of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources will be deputized as special prosecutors of the National Prosecution Service to address the rising cases of environmental crimes. The deputation of DENR lawyers is part of the memorandum of agreement signed by Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla and Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga Friday. The agreement, titled “Strengthening of Coordination and Collaboration between the DENR and DOJ-NPS in Investigating and Prosecuting Environmental Crimes”, extends the case build-up policy of the DOJ under Department Circular No. 20 to environmental crimes. Under the circular, there is increased prosecutor involvement to achieve reasonable certainty of conviction if cases are filed in court. ADVERTISEMENT “The case buildup is so important that is why this memorandum of agreement is so important to all our offices because we are the ones who are the main actors in this theater of life,” Remulla said. According to data from the DENR, from 2010 to 2022, there were only 42 convictions out of 170 cases filed against 549 violators caught in 264 wildlife operations. The DENR added that as of October 2024, there were 6,446 environmental crime cases, of which 27.2 percent were pending with prosecutors, 7.2 percent were dismissed by the prosecutors, 38.6 percent resulted in convictions and 22.5 percent remained under trial. Loyzaga underscored the policy of the Marcos administration that those who extract and exploit the country’s natural resources should follow the law. “We are not able to actually fulfill that directive without this cooperation with the Department of Justice, so we thank the leadership of Secretary Remulla for his pro-active pursuit of this commitment by the national government to uphold the principles of justice and to safeguard against those who seek to exploit, desecrate the natural resources of this country,” Loyzaga said. ADVERTISEMENT During the program, Remulla honored environmental lawyer Antonio Oposa, whom he referred to as the father of Philippine environmental law. Remulla noted that his children were among the petitioners in the landmark Supreme Court ruling on Oposa vs. Factoran which dealt with intergenerational responsibility or the responsibility of each generation to the next to preserve the environment. Remulla stressed the memorandum of agreement is part of that responsibility of the present generation to the next. “This is an institutional measure that we want to last two lifetimes, to several lifetimes, to the generations that would come after us that finally we do something in place that will ensure that environmental justice is done,” Remulla said.",

    "article_body": "The Philippine National Police has confirmed the incident involving its convoy, which was stopped and ticketed for illegally using the EDSA Bus Carousel lane in Ortigas on Tuesday, February 25. PNP Spokesperson Police Brigadier General Jean Fajardo said that while the police force is fully aware of existing traffic rules, the convoy had to take the restricted lane due to the urgent need for a senior officer to reach Camp Crame. \"The convoy was headed to Camp Crame because a closed-door meeting was taking place that required the urgent presence of our officer,\" she said. Despite the urgency, Fajardo emphasized that the convoy did not resist when flagged down by enforcers from the Department of Transportation - Special Action and Intelligence Committee on Transportation (DOTr-SAICT). ADVERTISEMENT The officers initially attempted to explain their situation, but upon refusal from enforcers, they accepted the ticket. \"Linawin po natin na iyon pong mga sasakyan na iyon ay nagpa-ticket. In fact, noong una po ay nag-attempt na makiusap iyong isa sa security explaining po iyong urgency kung bakit po sila dumaan doon sa lane. However, since hindi na nakipagtalo iyong security ay nagpa-ticket na lang po sila. Bagamat nakiusap na payagan pong makaalis iyong dalawang sasakyan,\" she said. According to the sequence of events, two motorcycle escorts were first stopped by DOTr-SAICT enforcers, who declined their explanation that the convoy was en route to Camp Crame. To express their intent to comply with traffic rules, one of the motorcycle escorts stayed behind to acknowledge their liability. \"At tama po, iyong dalawang sasakyan po ay bumalik. In fact, just to show their intention to really follow po iyong implementing guidelines po sa paggamit ng carousel lane, ay iniwan po doon iyong isang motorcycle escort para sabihin at maipakita na walang intention na takasan iyong kanilang liability,\" Fajardo added. ADVERTISEMENT The PNP also addressed the backlash on social media, acknowledging the criticisms and reiterating their respect for traffic regulations. However, the names of the senior officers onboard were withheld for security reasons. \"For security reasons, we will not disclose the identities of those in the convoy. What we can confirm is that they are senior officers holding sensitive positions,\" Fajardo said. The PNP assured the public that it remains committed to upholding the law, even when its own personnel are involved in such incidents.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) on Friday endorsed a barrage of criminal complaints against the 10 police officers who allegedly served a fake warrant of arrest and robbed a woman's house in Taguig City. The incident took place last Sunday and was caught on CCTV. The footage showed the cops entering the victim's house as they told the family they would be serving a warrant of arrest related to drugs. The victim's child, a minor, was allegedly hurt while helping her mother resist the cops. The officers succeeded in taking the mother and her daughter in their police vehicle — telling them they were going to the barangay office. ADVERTISEMENT But when the vehicle did not stop when it passed by the barangay hall, the victim decided to jump from the mobile, followed by her daughter who sustained an injury. Witnesses also took videos of the incident, which went viral. Police B.Gen. Anthony Aberin, the acting regional director of NCRPO, ordered the dismissal of the 10 cops from their respective posts. In cooperation with witnesses and the complainants who reported three cellphones missing from their store along with P50,000 cash, Taguig City Police submitted to the Taguig prosecutor's office complaints of Robbery, Grave Coercion, Physical Injury, Obstruction of Justice, Malicious Mischief, RA 7610, Unlawful Arrest, and Violation of Domicile against each of the 10. The complaints are \"based on their individual illegal actions committed and degree of participation in the illegitimate operation\", the NCRPO said in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT The Department of Justice (DOJ) will evaluate the complaints for filing in court if warranted. The NCRPO, however, assured the public that the cases they forwarded through Taguig City Police are \"airtight\", saying they are based on \"the pieces of evidence uncovered during the investigation, with the sole intention of ensuring that justice will be served to the victims.\" The involved officers will also be subject to an administrative investigation. \"If substantial evidence is found that transgressions against PNP rules were committed, concerned police officers will be dismissed, demoted or suspended, depending on the degree of their participation of the illegal act,\" Aberin stated. He said that NCRPO leadership has warned police personnel to follow protocol and to do their jobs correctly. ADVERTISEMENT “Any violation of law will not be tolerated and those who violate will face the full force of the law,\" he added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The lead counsel of Vice President Sara Duterte in her impeachment case on Wednesday hoped that their petition would be heard before the Supreme Court, noting the “constitutional issues” surrounding her case. “Sana mabigyan ng pansin ang aming petition. These are really constitutional issues. Kung babasahin niyo ang ating Constitution, even as the House has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment, hindi yun absolute,” said lawyer Sheila Sison. “Is the House permitted to have that unbridled discretion not to comply with its own set of rules that it had promulgated for impeachment proceedings just so it could pave the way for the fourth impeachment complaint that we think is Constitutionally proscribe,” she told reporters in a chance interview. Sison said the Duterte camp already asked the House Secretary General to provide a copy of the over 200 signatures of the lawmakers on the fourth impeachment complaint. ADVERTISEMENT “Humihingi kami ng certified true and correct copy from the Secretary General and I think this is a request that was refused,” she said. “We formally requested the Secretary General to provide us a certified true and correct copy of that,” she added. Reacting to some House lawmakers saying their petition is an act of desperation, she said this is a “normal” response. “I think sa kahit anumang issue na may magkatunggaling panig, may ganoong reaction. Hindi ko alam san makikita yung desperasyon kung pinag-aralan ang argumento, diba?” Duterte's camp filed the second legal challenge against the Vice President's impeachment at the Supreme Court. ADVERTISEMENT In her petition, the Vice President questioned the validity and constitutionality of the fourth impeachment complaint that was eventually transmitted by the House of Representatives to the Senate. Duterte stressed that the first three impeachment complaints were not transmitted by House Secretary General Reginal Velasco to House Speaker Martin Romualdez. But on February 5, 2025, the fourth impeachment complaint signed by 215 congressmen was endorsed by the House to the Senate. The Senate has yet to act on the articles of impeachment, with Senate President Francis Escudero saying the trial may begin after a new set of senators takes office in July.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Education will review the implementation of the Comprehensive Sexuality Education. This, following the House Committee on Basic Education Chair Representative Roman Romulo suggestion to suspend its implementation. Speaking to ABS-CBN News, Education Secretary Sonny Angara said the matter is expected to be tackled during their Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday. “Well isa yon sa mga tinitingnan natin kung papayagan ng batas na isuspend namin yung implementation dahil kami sinusundan lang naming kung ano yung nasa batas,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT (That’s one thing we will look at if the law will allow its implementation to be suspended because we are just following what’s stipulated in the law.) “Tama po si Chairman Roman na dapat i-review at tingnan yung laman ng ating sex education na siguraduhin na angkop sa edad na tinuturuan at angkop din sa ating kultura.” (Chairman Roman (Romulo) is right that it should be reviewed and the contents of sex education should be scrutinized to ensure that it is age-appropriate and in line with our culture.) The education chief assured that contrary to criticisms that sexuality education exposes young children to “intimacy and reproduction”, what is actually being taught at kindergarten is basic foundational knowledge like body parts with no “sexual references”. Angara says they agree with President Ferdinand Marcos Junior’s view that Comprehensive Sexuality Education should be age-appropriate. “Hindi dapat ituro yung hindi pa niya naiintindihan at maaaring hindi maganda ituro sa bata. Maganda naman ang intention pero ang importante hindi lang implementasyon, di lang yung intention, kundi yung implementation or yung execution noong batas,” Angara said. (Teaching children things they don’t have the ability to understand yet may not have good outcomes. The intention of the CSE is good, but aside from intention the implementation or execution of the law should also be good as well.)",

    "article_body": "“Congratulations to POTUS @realdonaldtrump and to the American people on another peaceful transfer of power in their Nation’s nearly 250-year history. I look forward to working closely with you and your Administration,” Marcos told Trump on X. “The strong and lasting PH-US alliance will continue to uphold our shared vision of prosperity and security in the region,” he added. Before Trump assumed office, Marcos this month said he was hopeful Manila and Washington would maintain their \"strong and dynamic\" relationship under the new US administration. The United States has a decades-old security alliance with the Philippines that includes a mutual defense treaty and a 2014 pact which allows the US military to store equipment on nine Philippine bases. ADVERTISEMENT Manila has stepped up security cooperation with Washington to blunt China's efforts to control most of the disputed South China Sea. While Trump underscored in his inauguration speech that the US will retake the Panama Canal from the control of China, the US chief executive was noticeably silent on how it plans to address Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, a strategic waterway where trillions of sea-borne goods pass through annually. While heads of states are not traditionally invited to the inauguration of a US president, Trump made an exception for several world leaders including Chinese President Xi Jinping, Argentinian President Javier and Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, among other far-right political figures. Xi did not attend the inauguration and instead sent Chinese Vice President Han Zheng, while the Philippines was represented by Filipino Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez. Under the previous Biden administration, the US provided $500 million in military funding to the Philippines as Washington sought to boost ties with Manila amid its maritime tensions with Beijing. Before ending her term earlier this month, former US Vice President Kamala Harris told Marcos Jr. that there was bipartisan support for the US to continue its close relationship with the Philippines.",

In a protest rally in front of the DOJ, the group said at least 69 development workers and 29 NGOs all over the country are currently facing charges related to terrorism. “Unang-una sa lahat itigil na iyong maling practice ng pag-file ng gawa-gawang kaso, iyong paglikha ng mga charges batay sa mga testimonya ng mga huwad na testigo kasama na ang mga rebel returnees,” said National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers Secretary General Josa Deinla. The group said the Philippine government has a Project Exit Grey List through the filing of supposedly trumped-up charges to meet the alleged quota of the FATF. ADVERTISEMENT The FATF is an international body that sets standards to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. Defend NGOs Alliance also appealed to the FATF, through an open letter, to scrutinize the terrorism-related charges being filed by the Philippine government in courts. “Dapat suriin nilang maigi kung ano ang inihahatag sa kanilang mga numero, numero lamang ito, pag nalaman nila ang katotohanan sa likod nito ay makikita nila iyong tinatawag na Project Exit Grey List ng Pilipinas,” Deinla said. The group also urged the Anti-Money Laundering Council to halt the issuance of freeze orders against NGOs which ultimately affect their beneficiaries. \"Itigil na rin ng AMLC ang pagi-issue ng freeze orders na alam natin isang proses na hindi rumerespeto sa due process dahil napaparalisa ang operasyon ng napakaraming CSOs na naghahatid ng serbisyo sa mahihirap na pamayanan sa Pilipinas, kasama na jan iyong mga disaster relief NGOs natin,\" it said.",

This is a stark contrast with the usual P100 to 120/kilo retail price of ginger. ADVERTISEMENT Consumers and retailers in markets are surprised with the spike of the price of ginger. The Department of Agriculture said production of ginger is seasonal, and harvest usually happens during summer. \"Yung mga na harvest noong March-April, nasa mga palengke na ngayon. Tumaas ang presyo dahil nasa stage na rin ng tag-ulan,\" said Usec. Ching Caballero, Undersecretary for High Value Crops of the Department of Agriculture.

According to the DOT, the program, which was launched last year, facilitates “a cultural tourism circuit development focused on heritage, culture, and arts to enhance current tour and domestic circuit offerings, which include: Food and Gastronomy, Pilgrimage and Wellness, Living Cultures and Heritage, and an Arts caravan.” Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco said that the caravan started Wednesday in General Santos City where the delegates were given the opportunity to experience the beaches of Sarangani. “They also had the opportunity to experience the actual tuna harvest which is quite an immersive weave into this thriving economic source for this region,” Frasco said in a televised briefing. ADVERTISEMENT “Tapos, we also had the opportunity to visit Malungon in Sarangani kung saan nagkaroon po tayo ng immersion and the opportunity to reach iyong B’laan and Tagakaolo communities and tribes and there we were able to appreciate their culture and tradition and their way of life.” Frasco said the caravan will make stops in Koronadal City, Lake Sebu, Sultan Kudarat, and North Cotabato. “Napakaganda po ng Mindanao and this region of Soccsksargen presented a wide variety of diverse tourism experiences – from mountainscapes to beaches, to immersions in our local indigenous tribes and really opportunities to get to know the heart and soul of the Philippines,” Frasco said. The Tourism Chief meanwhile highlighted efforts of the national government to boost tourism by investing in road infrastructures as well as in the improvement of airports and seaports. “And dahil po na iyong Pilipinas ay surrounded by water comparative to our ASEAN neighbors na magkakatabi lang po sila – iyong biggest challenge din po natin is really connectivity – that is why we’re working very closely with the Department of Transportation para naman po mas dumami pa iyong ating direct flights into the Philippines,” she said. Frasco said domestic tourism in the Philippines generated P53.3 billion in 2022, while the country reaped over P482 billion in international visitor receipts in 2023.",

The President says the probe will not only look into allegations of the anomalous sale, but also how it was carried out without the approval of proper authorities. “The situation actually does not only involve the anomalous sale of NFA rice. It also is an examination of some of the procedures within the NFA that were undertaken without board approval, without the proper discussion within the NFA and with the DA and with the rest of the Cabinet,” the President said in a recorded interview.

Sad naman if they are allowing this so close to the beautiful natural wonders of our country,\" she said. In an Instagram post, Janno Gibbs called out the DENR regarding the issue. \"At binabuy na ang Chocolate Hills. May basbas ng DENR,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT Another netizen likened the situation to Torre de Manila near Rizal Park. \"This resort within the landscape of the Chocolate Hills and Torre de Manila behind Rizal monument sits on the same table.\" The DENR said that the Chocolate Hills were declared a protected area in 1997 to preserve its iconic landscape and promote sustainable tourism. If a land was titled prior to an area's designation as a protected area, \"the rights and interests of the landowner will generally be recognized and respected,\" the agency added. The Chocolate Hills in Bohol was declared a national geological monument by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1988 \"in recognition of its scientific value and geomorphic uniqueness.\" ADVERTISEMENT \"Similar to the formations found in Java, the conical and almost symmetrical and same-sized hills known as the 'Chocolate Hills', are more aesthetically extensive. These were the uplift of coral deposits and the result of the action of rainwater and erosion,\" UNESCO said in its website. \"The hills are located throughout the towns of Carmen, Batuan and Sagbayan and consist of about 1,776 mounds of the same general shape. During the dry season when precipitation in inadequate, the grass-covered hills turn chocolate brown, hence the name in reference to a branded confection,\" they added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday left the country for the fifth time this year to travel to Germany and Czechia, a trip he describes as a “pivotal moment in our efforts to deepen bilateral relations.” German and Czech leaders had invited Marcos to travel to their respective countries after they visited Manila in April 2023 and January 2024, respectively. “During our time in Germany and the Czech Republic, I will underscore our unwavering commitment to strengthening partnerships with like-minded countries, promoting the rules-based international order which serves as the cornerstone of global peace and stability,” Marcos said in his pre-departure statement at the Villamor Airbase. Marcos' trip to Europe’s largest economy comes on the heels of his back-to-back trips in Australia, where he urged international leaders to rally behind the Philippines in pushing back against China’s expansionist agenda in the South China Sea. ADVERTISEMENT At least 2 agreements will be signed between Manila and Berlin, including a “joint declaration of intent on strengthening maritime cooperation” and a deal to forge closer cooperation between the two countries’ vocational education agencies. In Prague, Marcos and his Czech counterparts will witness the signing of agreements that will “elevate cooperation for the Safe and orderly migration of Filipino workers and provide a higher level of protection for Filipinos.” “We will also focus on expanding economic cooperation, opening up more avenues for mutually beneficial trade and investment opportunities,” Marcos said, noting that he will be meeting with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and Czech Republic’s 4 Constitutional heads of government. “It is important that as we enhance our labor cooperation with these countries, our highest priority remains the protection of the rights and the welfare of our overseas Filipino workers,” he said. The Philippines seeks to “tap Germany’s expertise in renewable energy to assist us in our energy transition efforts,” Marcos Jr. said. ADVERTISEMENT The Czech Republic, on the other hand, has expertise in the fields of agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, and scientific instruments, among others. “We are eager to invite Germany and the Czech Republic to consider the Philippines as a production hub for their products,” he said. “I will be meeting confident that this visit will yield a fruitful outcome,” he added. The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier defended the frequency of the president’s overseas trips, saying that these are investments for both diplomacy and trade.",

Marcos assured the government is in constant contact with the families of the victims. \"We will spare no effort in bringing their remains home,\" he said. The two Filipino seafarers were killed in a recent attack by Houthi rebels on the bulk carrier MV True Confidence navigating the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. ADVERTISEMENT The incident is the first Houthi attack that resulted in fatalities. It is the latest of a series of sea attacks that the group has carried out since November 2023. Marcos also reported that the 13 surviving Filipino seafarers, including the three who were injured during the attack, are now safely in Djibouti. They are being assisted by the Philippine Embassy in Cairo to return safely home as soon as possible. \"I have instructed the DFA, DMW-OWWA, DOH, and DSWD to provide assistance to the seafarers and their families,\" said the President. \"We remain firmly committed to the safety and welfare of our seafarers and overseas Filipino workers in the region. \"The Philippines joins global calls for the end to this conflict and for full respect for the principle of freedom of navigation.\" Earlier, a group of local manning agencies condemned the Houthi attack and the militants' threat to the lives of seafarers. ADVERTISEMENT According to the Joint Manning Agency (JMA), 70 percent of ships have already rerouted to avoid the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden. However, some are forced to continue taking this route due to the heavy commercial impact of taking alternative and longer routes. The first vessel that fell victim to the attacks of the Houthis was car carrier Galaxy Leader and its 25 man crew - 17 of which are Filipinos. All crew members are still currently being held hostage in Yemen. Shortly after the seizure of Galaxy Leader, the Houthis made a pronouncement that it shall only release the crew and cease from sea attacks, if Israel will end its war on Gaza.",

Una, hindi pinapayagan ng LTFRB (Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) na mag-renew ng kanilang PA o temporary permit to operate,” Floranda told ABS-CBN News. He said drivers and operators would attend another the continuation of the House of Representatives probe on Wednesday to iron out issues on PUV modernization.

The DOH official also urged Filipinos to leave fireworks display to professional to avoid injuries. MANILA — The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) honored the legacy of Fernando Poe Sr., with the unveiling of his statue at the Fernando Poe Sr. Reservist Firing Range in Camp Aguinaldo. The event, held on the 73rd anniversary of his passing, celebrated the life of Captain Allan Fernando Reyes Poe (his real name) remembered both as a father of Philippine cinema and as a decorated hero of World War II. The statue, donated by the Poe family, commemorates his exploits during the war. Poe was the father of \"The King of Philippine Movies\" Fernando Poe Jr. ADVERTISEMENT Maj. Gen. Ramon P. Zagala, Commander, Reserve Command, Philippine Army (RESCOM, PA) cited Poe Sr.’s service as a good example of a true Filipino hero and reservist. “Fernando Poe Sr. served during world war 2 and defended our country as a citizen soldier from the reserve serving the 2nd Infantry division. Like many Filipinos, he defended the country from invasion and occupation by the imperial Army of Japan until liberation. He brought with him specialized civilian skills and became a role model who embody civic duty, community spirit, and resilience, demonstrating that patriotism and service are responsibilities shared by all citizens,” he said. FPJ Panday Bayanihan Representative Brian Poe, speaking on behalf of the family, said the event was both a personal and national moment of pride. The younger Poe said the tribute honors “not just a man of film, but a man of action—one who lived with courage, served with honor, and inspired with his example.” Born in San Carlos City, Pangasinan, Poe Sr. was called to active duty on December 20, 1941, as a member of the Reserve Officers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. ADVERTISEMENT He served as Assistant Provost Marshal and later joined the Lamao Combat Team Regiment in Bataan. When the Bataan Peninsula fell on April 9, 1942, Poe endured and survived the Bataan Death March—one of the most harrowing episodes in the nation’s history. He later joined the guerrilla movement, continuing to fight for the Philippines’ liberation from Japanese occupation. For his heroism in Bataan in 1942, Poe was awarded the Gold Cross Medal, one of the Philippine Army’s highest honors, for meritorious service under intense bombing and strafing, and for his daring sacrifice and devotion to duty. The younger Poe described the statue’s installation at the RESCOM Firing Range as a symbolic return to the ranks of those who served the nation. ADVERTISEMENT “By placing this statue here, we bring him back to his first home—among those who serve quietly, steadfastly, and with honor,” he said. “Ang mga reservist ay patunay na ang kabayanihan ay hindi nalilimita sa panahon ng digmaan,” he said. “Ito ay buhay sa bawat Pilipinong handang mag-alay ng oras, lakas, at talento para sa kapwa at sa bansa.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Amid parties and gatherings during the holiday season, the Department of Health-Metro Manila Center for Health Development (DOH-MMCHD) advised the public to avoid so-called \"MA-food\": maalat (salty), mataba (fatty), and matamis (sweet) dishes. Dr. Aleli Annie Grace Sudiacal, director of DOH-MMCHD, said this is part of the agency's wish for healthy gatherings and celebrations. \"Huwag pa rin po mag-salty at saka matataba at fatty food, iyong matatamis. Doon naman sa mga hypertensive o may sakit sa puso, totally avoid these... We can still enjoy the season with all the parties that we are having, mga salo salo pero eat everything in moderation,\" she told reporters during the launch of the agency's Ligtas Christmas and Iwas-Paputok campaign in Mandaluyong. If it were up to the agency, Sudiacal said it will also be better to stop drinking alcohol. ADVERTISEMENT \"We're asking people na huwag nang uminom. Before sabi natin moderation, pero ang sinasabi ngayon ng WHO (World Health Organization), there's no safety level for alcohol so talagang avoid alcohol na po,\" she said. The official added there's also an increase in the number of people who suffer from heart attack amid the holiday season, citing data from the American Heart Association. \"Ina-attribute siya sa mga kinakain natin, iyong iba ina-attribute din doon sa hiwalay sa pamilya or hindi kasama ang pamilya for some reason. This season brings joy and sadness at the same time, so kailangan natin paigtingin iyong mensahe na we have to be healthy during this season,\" Sudiacal explained, basing on local data. She also appealed to the public to take precautions, as COVID and influenza-like illnesses are on the rise. \"We advocate lang for those who are sick to still wear masks, but we are not saying na huwag kayong lumabas, huwag kayong mag-converge. Doon po sa halimbawa, masama ang pakiramdam, may ubo, may sipon. Kung maaari po, just stay in the house. Or if you have to go out, mag-mask pa rin po tayo.\" ADVERTISEMENT ON FIRECRACKERS, TOYS DOH-MMCHD data showed a 101.43 percent jump in firecracker-related injuries in the past two holiday season, from only 70 injuries recorded in December 21, 2021 to January 6, 2022, to 141 injuries in the 2022-2023 season. Sudiacal explained this can be attributed to the \"increase[d] mobility of people\". \"But if you compare it with previous years, it's not that high pa naman po. And we're hoping that sa kampanya na ito, people still will follow iyong sinabing resolution ng MMDA na they'll be in common areas na lang. Bawal na po kasi ang household paputok, dapat sa community na lang.\" As this is also the season of gift-giving, the DOH-MMCHD asked the public to give \"age-appropriate\" toys, especially to children. \"Aside from being age-appropriate, sana iyong something that cannot be swallowed or paghiwa-hiwalayin ng mga bata. Dapat alam natin iyong nagfo-follow ng standards. Hindi gawa sa lead, mga pintura na gawa sa lead. Kung maaari din po huwag sana iyong nag-create ng malakas na sound which can cause temporary deafness sa ating mga kabataan. Huwag din po sana iyong parang mga baril, pwedeng tamaan nila iyong mga mata ng kanilang kalaro,\" Sudiacal said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- The Bureau of Fire Protection on Tuesday announced that they will stay under code red, or full alert status, nationwide until January 1, 2024 as it prepares for possible fire incidents during the New Year celebration. \"Lahat ay kailangang rumesponde in case na kailanganin ang ating serbisyo. Aala pong allowed na naka-leave ngayong panahon na ito, dahil kailangang full-force ang Bureau of Fire Protection,\" BFP Spokesperson F/Supt Annalee Atienza said in a televised briefing. The BFP also continued to remind the public to be mindful of fire prevention measures. Atienza says the BFP supports the Department of the Interior and Local Government memorandum encouraging local government units (LGUs) to ban the use of firecrackers in households, and instead hold their own designated fireworks displays in their localities. ADVERTISEMENT \"In case na mag-fireworks sa ating sariling area, siguraduhin na ito ay safe, malawak at gagawin ng adult. At ganun na rin, ang nakaantabay na balde ng tubig o buhangin. At mainam na rin po na mayroon tayong fire extinguishers sa ating tahanan,\" she said. The BFP official also noted safer alternatives to using fireworks, such as pots and pans, videoke machines, and using car horns. Meanwhile, as of January 1 to December 26, 2023, the BFP recorded a total of 15,679 fire incidents, which is 20% more than the over 12,000 fire incidents recorded last year. Atienza says the majority of the fires were caused by electrical ignition caused by arching, loose connection, and cigarette smoking. \"Majority sa mga sunog ay residential. Sa residential po, hindi sya sakop ng fire code, kung saan merong annual fire safety inspection,\" she explained. \"Bagkus, only kapag ito ay nako-construct at bago i-occupy. But over time, nagdadagdag ng appliances, nagkakaroon ng panibagong miyembro ng pamilya, kumbaga ay lumalago ang household, ay nao-overlook ang mga linya ng kuryente kung angkop pa ba yung ating suplay, or capacity ng kuryente.\" The BFP has also recorded 24 fire incidents caused by firecrackers from January 1 to December 26, 2023, lower than the 28 fire incidents recorded in the same period last year. \"Nitong dumaan ang December 24 hanggang ngayong araw, zero fire incidents po tayo pagdating sa firecrackers,\" she said. \"Panatilihin na natin ito na zero fire incident hanggang pumasok ang 2024.\"",

    "date_published": "2023-12-22T13:18:55+00:00",
    "article_body": "Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista is seeking a study into the Passenger Bill of Rights after several passengers at the Manila North Port Passenger Terminal complained about how their cancelled trips were handled. Passengers said shipping companies texted them late about the cancellation. They had already left the house and many couldn’t go back because they came from provinces. Passengers also had to contend with sleeping on the floor with a carton as their mat since there were not enough chairs. Some hoped for free food because their budget was running out, but did not get any. ADVERTISEMENT “‘Yung Passenger Bill of Rights dapat it should apply not only to airplane passengers, dapat yan siguro sa lahat ng transport sectors,” Bautista said. “Siguro magkakaroon lang ng kaunting variation depende sa sector…So ‘yan pag-usapan namin sa aming mga meetings with the attached agencies.” Sharon Ngo, VP-Business Unit Head for Sea Solutions of shipping company 2GO, said they gave water and snacks. They also allowed early embarkation on their cargo-passenger RoRo vessel to provide better accommodation for passengers. Ngo was quick to say that they sent out advisories and text messages about the rescheduling of trips. “Kami naman po ay nagbibigay ng mga advanced na anunsiyo sa ating mga pasahero through our social media, makikita niyo po. At saka po kami po ay nagtetext po sa mga pasahero. So ang pakiusap po namin, at the time of booking, pakideclare po ang tamang numero kasi ‘yun po talaga ang aming mga kino-contact,” Ngo said. ADVERTISEMENT “Ang amin pong pakiusap ay kung sakali po ay huwag po kayo masyadong maagang pumunta po sa ating pantalan because ang gusto po natin ay mas komportable po sila at ma-manage ang volume ng ating passengers,” she added. Bautista acknowledged the efforts of 2GO, but said that meals should be given instead. “Dapat bigyan natin ng tamang pagkain ang mga pasahero pero siguro isipin din natin na meron ding limitasyon ang mga ship owners. May limitasyon din ang port operators kaya ang mahihiling ko lang sa ating mga pasahero ay dumating nang tamang oras lang,” Bautista said. As to the allegedly high fees of porters that some passengers complained about, Bautista said they will review the subject with the Board of the Philippine Ports Authority. Meanwhile, Philippine Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Ronnie Gavan said he has given clear instructions for the checking manifesto. ADVERTISEMENT “Dapat lahat ng pasahero ay nasa manifesto. So ‘yung mga pasahero na nalaman nila na walang manifesto, ‘yung isang biyahe ng barko ay ating nire-request na i-report agad sa nearest Cost Guard station. Hindi ko po ito-tolerate ang aking mga tauhan na magpapalusot ng biyahe na walang manifesto,” Gavan said. “Walang overloading. Very explicit din ang guidance lalo na ni Secretary na dapat lahat ay nasa tamang bilang lang sa authorized number of passengers,” he added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Wednesday reminded the public to check the authenticity of the firecrackers and fireworks they would use to welcome the New Year. The DTI issued the warning after more than 1,500 illegal products were confiscated in Bulacan last week. Forty-four out of 33 manufacturers who have licenses from the government have used their Philippine Standard (PS) mark in models that were not approved by the DTI, Assistant Secretary Amanda Nograles told state television PTV. “Ang inspeksyon natin hanggang Bagong Taon yan tuloy-tuloy… kasi delikado yung fireworks and firecrackers na dinidikitan lang basta-basta ng PS mark,” she said. “Ang ordinaryong consumer, mahihirapan na masuri ang mga PS mark,” she said. Those who plan to buy fireworks and firecrackers should first check if the seller has a license from the Philippine National Police (PNP), and if their products have PS marks. Once the PS mark is found, consumers should check if the type of product they are buying is included in the list of legal fireworks and firecrackers posted on the DTI’s website (bps@dti.gov.ph), the official said. “Kada manufacturer na mayroong lisensya mayroon lang specific models na puwede silang imanufacture at ibenta,” she said. “Mas maganda icheck yung bawal ng PNP at ano yung pinayagan ng DTI. Kailangan balik-balikan natyin yung listahan,” she said. Imported fireworks and firecrackers are also banned in the Philippines, Nograles said. “Bawal ang imported so pag mayroon po kayong nakitang imported, hindi yan otorisado ng DTI,” she said. Manufacturers who will violate government regulations on the production of these items will face a P300,000 fine, while sellers will be slapped with a P25,000 fine per violation, the Assistant Secretary said. Other agencies may also impose additional penalties against erring manufacturers and sellers, she said. ADVERTISEMENT RELATED VIDEO",

Jean Fajardo said in a press briefing at Camp Crame. Fajardo was reacting to Pennsylvania Rep. Susan Wild’s measure at the US Congress seeking to limit her country's security assistance to the PNP over human rights concerns. Wild’s proposed amendment to the US’ National Defense Authorization Act states that “no funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available to the Department of State are authorized to be made available to provide assistance for the Philippine National Police, including assistance in the form of equipment or training.\" ADVERTISEMENT The American legislator listed down four conditions for the PNP in order for aid to continue: On her Twitter account, Wild said that \"taxpayer dollars shouldn't be used to supply weapons, training, or any other assistance to state security forces that violently target political opponents.\" The PNP was quick to make a defense. “The PNP, as an institutional policy has always been advocates and defender of human rights,\" Fajardo said. She said the PNP has been a partner of the US government and has received assistance in the form of training and equipment, and in the field of investigation, drug enforcement and child trafficking. ADVERTISEMENT Fajardo noted that from June 2016 to 2021, the PNP received 655 trainings from the US government, participated by around 11,000 personnel. For 2022, the program of the American government offered 115 courses held in the country, overseas and other regions. She said the PNP's programs for 2023 and onwards may be affected should the US Congress pass Wild's measure.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) on Thursday updated the details of the reported fifth fatality from the powerful Luzon earthquake. NDRRMC spokesperson Mark Timbal said that the initially reported fifth fatality from Cagayan province has been verified to be non-existent. But the death toll remains at five as another report of a person who died in Ilocos Sur was received by the agency but still subject for verification. \"Earlier today, we went to four fatalities because the Cagayan fatality was already tagged as non-existent... But this morning, we had another item reported to us. So, we're back to 5. We have five fatalities reported now at the NDRRMC again,\" Timbal told ANC's Dateline Philippines. ADVERTISEMENT The other reported deaths from Wednesday's magnitude 7 quake are from La Trinidad and Tuba in Benguet, Balbalan in Kalinga province, and Bangued in Abra. Timbal said these have since been confirmed by local officials. Up to 131 people have also been reported wounded following the quake. Majority or 113 of them were from the Cordillera Administrative Region (CAR). The affected population stood at 12,945 from six provinces, latest NDRRMC data also showed. Twenty-one evacuation centers have been opened, catering to 541 families. The NDRRMC recorded 857 partially damaged and 11 destroyed houses in the CAR. ADVERTISEMENT Damage to infrastructure is initially estimated to cost P33.8 million. No dams were damaged by the quake, said Timbal. He said search, rescue, and retrieval operations are being done by local governments, although so far, they have not yet received a complete report of missing persons. Meanwhile, Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista said that the public transport system in the quake-affected areas has returned to normal. Bus companies and seaports have went back to their normal operations, he said. No major damage was reported in the airports within the areas hardest hit by the earthquake. But there were cracks seen in the terminal buildings of the Laoag Airport and in Loakan Airport in Baguio City, Bautista said. ADVERTISEMENT Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Manuel Bonoan said that most of the major roads in Region 1 and CAR have been cleared, except for Kennon Road in Benguet. \"For safety reasons, we are closing iyong Kennon Road because may mga aftershocks pa. And we don't want to endanger iyong motorists natin doon kung may malaglag pa na mga bato na maliliit,\" Bonoan said. The DPWH is now also planning to reinforce slope protection projects in some of the quake-hit roads in Luzon, but it would take some time before it is safe to do so, he said.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Anxious residents slept outside after hundreds of aftershocks rattled the earthquake-hit northern Philippines, locals said Thursday, as President Ferdinand Marcos Jr flew to the region to inspect the damage. Five people were killed and more than 150 injured when a 7.0-magnitude quake struck the lightly populated province of Abra on Wednesday morning, authorities said. The powerful quake rippled across the mountainous region, toppling buildings, triggering landslides and shaking high-rise towers hundreds of kilometers away in the capital Manila. \"Aftershocks happen almost every 20 minutes, 15 minutes since yesterday,\" said Reggi Tolentino, a restaurant owner in Abra's provincial capital Bangued. ADVERTISEMENT \"Many slept outside last night, almost every family.\" Hundreds of buildings were damaged or destroyed, roads were blocked by landslides and power was knocked out in affected provinces. But in Abra, which felt the full force of the quake, overall damage had been \"very minimal\", police chief Colonel Maly Cula told AFP. \"We don't have a lot of people in evacuation sites although many people are staying in the streets because of the aftershocks,\" Cula said. \"Abra is back to normal.\" ADVERTISEMENT More than 800 aftershocks have been recorded since the quake hit, including 24 that were strong enough to feel, the local seismological agency said. In Vigan City, a UNESCO World Heritage site and tourist destination in Ilocos Sur province, centuries-old structures built during the Spanish colonial period were damaged. Governor Jeremias Singson told Teleradyo that 460 buildings in the province had been affected, including the Bantay Bell Tower, which partially crumbled. \"Our tourism industry and small business owners were really affected,\" Singson said. The Philippines is regularly rocked by quakes due to its location on the Pacific \"Ring of Fire\", an arc of intense seismic activity that stretches from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin. ADVERTISEMENT Wednesday's quake was one of the strongest recorded in the Philippines in recent years and was felt across swathes of Luzon island, the most populous in the archipelago. In October 2013, a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck Bohol Island in the central Philippines, killing more than 200 people and triggering landslides. Old churches in the birthplace of Catholicism in the Philippines were badly damaged. Nearly 400,000 were displaced and tens of thousands of houses were damaged. The powerful quake altered the island's landscape and a \"ground rupture\" pushed up a stretch of earth by about 2 meters, creating a wall of rock above the epicenter. In 1990, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake in the northern Philippines created a ground rupture stretching over a hundred kilometers. ADVERTISEMENT Fatalities were estimated to reach over 1,200, with major damage to buildings in Manila.",

Sherwin Gatchalian, 44 percent of Filipinos are dissatisfied with the K-12 system. This is higher than the 28 percent dissatisfaction rate in a 2019 survey. The agency had ordered a review of the Kinder to Grade 10 program before President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s administration, Densing said. \"I believe they're now finalizing their assessment and will be proposing revisions any time soon,\" he told ANC's Headstart. ADVERTISEMENT Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte has also ordered a review of Grades 11 to 12, Densing added. \"Hopefully we’ll have the immediate results as soon as possible,\" he said. Densing said his personal opinion was English should be taught from Kindergarten instead of the mother tongue, which is mandated under the current curriculum. \"I would want to say we use regular English language as medium of instruction, with the mother tongue as an exception,\" he said. \"Use mother tongue only as an exception in case that area is not really introduced to English.\" Densing added that teachers should be trained yearlong instead of being given a week of seminars. \"Training teachers should be on a module basis. In other terms, there should be a yearlong program, but the modules would be given in tranches,\" he said. \"Based on the assessment being done right now, it's something we expect to hear from the evaluators of the K to 12 program.\"",

There were no truly bold ideas which I find surprising given his mandate. Somebody who allegedly got 31 million votes has really an overwhelming mandate, tawag po ata dyan political capital which you could use to propose new bold ideas,\" he told ANC's Headstart.

The fight against inflation, how will we solve our debt problem?\" he said. \"I don't think we can go on forever borrowing. If our generation keeps on borrowing to support our lifestyle we’re actually depriving our descendants of their own quality of life.\" Pimentel said he would fulfill his duties as Senate Minority Leader even if he is friends with Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri. \"We are good friends.

The platform of unity was Marcos' main campaign message in the lead-up to the May elections that he won by a landslide. \"For the SONA, we expect na mag-go beyond na siya doon sa empty rhetoric ng unity kasi kung taumbayan naman, actually, we have lots of unity,\" Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel told ANC's Dateline Philippines. (For the SONA, we expect him to go beyond the empty rhetoric of unity because among the people, actually, we have lots of unity.)

Marcos will unveil his economic “game plan” when he delivers his SONA on Monday, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno earlier said. Manuel urged the Marcos administration to reject new taxes for the already \"overburdened\" public. \"Dapat din hindi i-deny 'yung mga statistics, dapat kilalanin 'yung mga statistics, 'yung ganung figures kasi puwedeng nagre-reflect na 'yan kung 'Kumusta na ba nagugutom na ba 'yung taumbayan?' Ang daming walang trabaho,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT (Statistics should not be denied, these must be recognized. Those figures may reflect the people's situation, \"Are they suffering from hunger?\" Many have no jobs.) As government eyes full face-to-face classes, Manuel urged it to build confidence among students and parents as the threat of COVID-19 lingered. \"Sa part natin sa legislation, na-file na natin 'yung Safe School Reopening bill to outline kung ano 'yung mga pangangailangan for immediate and safe reopening of campuses,\" Manuel said, adding that he hoped Marcos would identify it as a priority measure. (For our part, we have filed the Safe School Reopening bill to outline the needs for the immediate and safe reopening of campuses.) \"'Yun 'yung ating babantayan (that's what we will watch out for).\"",

Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles issued the statement after being asked whether Marcos' stance on \"not giving up a square inch\" of the country's territory applies to Sabah, which is now a Malaysian state. \"The President’s articulation of his statement about not giving up a square inch of territory will have to be reduced into writing and into specifics after which we will announce these to you if they are in anyway related to the Sabah claim,\" Cruz-Angeles told reporters. \"At the moment wala pa pong articulation so we have to wait,\" she added. ADVERTISEMENT A French Arbitral court earlier ordered the Malaysian government to pay the heirs of the Sulu sultanate $14 billion for its land lease violation dating back to 1878. Malaysia has refused to recognize the ruling. The Philippines lays claim over Sabah, citing a land lease agreement in 1878 between the Sultanate of Sulu and the British North Borneo Chartered Co. Malaysia has governed Sabah while the Philippines continues to assert its claim. Former presidential spokesman Harry Roque, Marcos' private counsel, has praised the French court's decision against Malaysia, saying it \"strengthens\" the Philippines' claim to Sabah. ADVERTISEMENT \"The Philippines has never surrendered its claim to the territory,\" said Roque in a Facebook post in July. \"I advise our President to clarify whether the country will actively pursue this claim or allow the Sultanate heirs to negotiate privately with the Malaysian government,\" he added. Roque said in 2020 that Manila remains firm in its claim on the territory based on an agreement with the Sultanate of Sulu. Malaysia had denied that the Philippines has a claim on Sabah. In March 2013, Marcos Jr. said Sabah belongs to the Philippines. ADVERTISEMENT \"We, as a republic, have a claim over Sabah since the 1960's, we have historical claim over Sabah and that's a fact,\" Marcos, then a senator, said in a press release. \"The Sultan of Sulu and his people are Filipino citizens and, by virtue of that fact, they deserve protection from the government of the Philippines... it's the responsibility of the government to protect its citizens,\" he added. His father, the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Sr., in September 1968 said the Philippines would pursue any peaceful means to stake its claims to Sabah and bring the issue to the International Court of Justice.",

Enrique Manalo told US State Secretary Antony Blinken in a joint press conference. Manalo credited the US for giving the Philippines some 33.6 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, the “largest we have received from a single country partner.” “The Philippines is grateful for the substantial and critical support of the United States in our COVID-19 recovery efforts,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “The over 33.6 million donated vaccine doses… have saved millions of lives and supported our economy and health system.” Blinken said the US “seeks to work closely” with the Marcos administration to ensure that the alliance between Manila and Washington would “make the proud history that we share into a living history for the benefit of Filipinos and Americans alike.” “The US remains a top 3 trading partners for the Philippines. American firms are among the largest employers, the biggest tax payers and the highest value exporters here,” Blinken said. “We wanna expand those ties on private sector investments, on public-private partnerships and by working together to address leading challenges of the 21st century economy like shaping emerging technologies, strengthening our supply chains, accelerating our transition to a green economy,” he said. “This is not about getting back to where we were before COVID-19, it’s about moving forward and transitioning all our economies to the needs and events and opportunities that are in the 21st century,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT In May, Indian Ambassador to the Philippines Shambhu Kumaran said Marcos was “very keen” on developing PH’s domestic pharmaceutical sector and Indian firms “are looking forward to a strong engagement.” The United States and India are among the countries that house the largest pharmaceutical firms in the world. On Friday, Marcos spoke to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the phone, but no specifics were mentioned as of posting time.",

    "date_published": "2025-03-17T09:25:42+00:00",
    "article_body": "MANILA — At least two leaders of the House Quad Committee want the Bureau of Immigration (BI) and the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) to explain how former Presidential Spokesperson Atty. Harry Roque was able to leave the Philippines. This, despite a contempt and detention order issued by the mega-panel against him last September for skipping its hearings. Roque is currently in the Netherlands as part of the legal team defending former President Rodrigo Duterte from crimes against humanity charges before the International Criminal Court (ICC). Quad Comm co-chairperson and ABANG LINGKOD Party List Representative Joseph Stephen Paduano said he will move to invite the representatives of the DFA and the BI in the mega-panel’s next hearing, tentatively scheduled on Friday. ADVERTISEMENT “As of now, we cannot talk about the liabilities of the two agencies, but… they have to explain to the committee na Harry Roque is cited in contempt, but he's scot-free, especially ngayon, lumabas na talaga, with VP Sara pa and all other entourage doon sa The Hague,” Paduano said. “Explain to the committee with regards to the documents, especially this passport being used by Harry Roque... Hindi pa nga namin alam talaga kung from what country siya before Netherlands nanggaling. Malalaman natin siguro ‘yan in the next hearing,” he added. The House’s contempt and detention order against Roque stemmed from his repeated failure to attend the Quad Comm’s inquiry into Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators. It remains in effect, according mega-panel’s overall chairperson and Surigao del Norte 2nd District Representative Robert Ace Barbers. “I think we should already ask the Bureau of Immigration: Ano ba’ng nangyari? Saan ba galing ‘yan? Kasi I’m sure gumamit ng passport ‘yan pagdating niya doon sa Netherlands, and ‘yung kanyang port of origin will definitely be reflected in his passport. So bakit hindi naiinform ang Bureau of Immigration tungkol dyan? Bakit walang aksyon ang ating Bureau of Immigration?” he told the media in an interview. ADVERTISEMENT He, however, believes that Roque cannot be arrested in the Netherlands on the basis of the House Quad Comm’s contempt and detention order. “Jurisdictionally kasi ‘yung contempt order ng House, sa Pilipinas lang ‘yun… I think ‘yung Interpol will only come into the picture if there’s already a case (before the court), or a case has already been decided, or a warrant (from the court),” Barbers explained. Roque, who had served as Palace spokesperson during the Duterte administration, said he would file the asylum application. House Assistant Minority Leader and Gabriela Party List Representative Arlene Brosas slammed Roque's announcement to seek asylum in The Netherlands as a “mockery of justice” and an alleged “attempt to dodge accountability”. \"Roque’s asylum bid is nothing but a pathetic attempt to dodge accountability. He’s not seeking refuge—he’s looking for an escape route. Roque has a lot of explaining to do—from his ties to Lucky South 99 to his sudden ‘jackpot’ in wealth,\" she said. ADVERTISEMENT Brosas urged the DFA and the Department of Justice to coordinate with international authorities to ensure Roque faces the House Quad Committee. Roque had repeatedly denied links to Lucky South 99, a formerly-registered Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) raided in Porac, Pampanga over allegations of illegal activities. He also denied having unexplained wealth.",

CIDG Director MGen. Nicolas Torre III said this would still depend on the opinion of the justice department and the prosecution panel and whether or not they need the CIDG's testimony. The CIDG in November launched efforts to track those who Duterte allegedly contracted to exterminate President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. should a kill plot against her succeed. \"Sa ngayon, let me not put the cart before the horse kasi ang investigation kay VP Sara ay ginagawa joint palagi ng NBI at ng CIDG, under the offices of the DOJ,\" Torre told reporters in a news forum. ADVERTISEMENT \"Pero siyempre kapag pinatawag kami, bilang CIDG chief, kapag pinatawag ako in matters I investigated, obviously I have no other course but to appear in the impeachment court kung kinakailangan,\" he said. The National Bureau of Investigation served Duterte a subpoena on November 26, and required the Vice President to present herself before the agency to explain why she issued a kill threat against the chief executive. She, however, excused herself from appearing before the NBI. The Vice President was impeached by the House of Representatives on charges of \"violation of the constitution, betrayal of public trust, graft and corruption, and other high crimes.\" Accusations spelled out in the 44-page document include an alleged plot to assassinate President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., First Lady Liza Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, a Marcos cousin. The Vice President earlier said that her comments – taken from an expletive-filled speech where she claimed herself to be the subject of a plot – had been taken out of context. -- With reports from Katrina Domingo, ABS-CBN News",

    "article_body": "MANILA —The Palace on Sunday maintained that former President Rodrigo Duterte's March 11 arrest based on an International Criminal Court warrant was lawful. Sen. Ronald \"Bato\" dela Rosa, in a speech at a prayer rally at the Liwasang Bonifacio in Manila on Saturday, claimed that the Marcos Jr. administration illegally arrested the former president since the Philippines left the ICC in 2019. The ICC has retained jurisdiction for alleged crimes against humanity reported before the country's exit from the court, a move prompted by its inquiry into the situation in the Philippines. Palace press officer Claire Castro responded to Dela Rosa's latest accusation, saying that a domestic law — Republic Act No. 9851 — was followed for Duterte's arrest. ADVERTISEMENT The Philippine Act on Crimes Against International Humanitarian Law, Genocide, and Other Crimes Against Humanity penalizes crimes against International Humanitarian Law, genocide, and other crimes against humanity. Duterte stands accused of the crime against humanity of murder over his years-long campaign against drug users and dealers that rights groups said killed thousands. \"Wala tayong magagawa sa kanyang sasabihin... siyempre 'yan ang sasabihin niya 'yan. Ang gusto niyang iparating sa taumbayan na ilegal 'yung pagsuko,\" Castro said, referring to the lawmaker. (We cannot stop him from saying that... Of course, he would say something like that because he wants to convince people that it was illegal) The government has maintained its position that it will not cooperate with the ICC but is bound to help the International Police Organization, or Interpol, if it asks for help, as it did in serving the warrant last week. ADVERTISEMENT Duterte supporters argue the former president should be tried in the Philippines for the alleged extrajudicial killings. Families of drug war victims have said however that they went to the ICC because domestic processes were not working. Dela Rosa was Duterte's first chief of national police and a key implementer of his anti-illegal drugs crackdown. The lawmaker is also one of the subjects of the ICC probe into the alleged crimes against humanity and could also face a warrant from the international tribunal soon. In the prosecutor's application for his arrest, he said Duterte's alleged crimes were \"part of a widespread and systematic attack directed against the civilian population in the Philippines.\" ADVERTISEMENT \"Potentially tens of thousands of killings were perpetrated,\" the prosecutor alleged of the campaign that targeted mostly poor men, often without proof they were linked to drugs. —with Agence France-Presse",

ADVERTISEMENT Pro-impeachment lawmakers have criticized the Senate leadership for not convening immediately as an impeachment court, even as the Constitution is clear that the upper chamber should act on the impeachment \"forthwith.\" \"Marami pong mga iba-ibang klase ng opinyon but if you will look and read the provisions of the constitution, you will see po to forthwith proceed, right? Pero wala pong makikitang time element. Is it to forthwith proceed even during recess? Because they can proceed definitely if there is session, there’s no question about that. But, to proceed during recess, grey area po iyan sa constitution,\" she said. \"So, they may forthwith proceed after the recess. ‘Pag may session po walang problema eh, they have to do. But during the recess, wala pong sinasabi ang konstitusyon na you have to call for a special session to proceed with the impeachment proceedings or with the impeachment trial. Wala po kasing ganoon nakasabi sa konstitusyon.\" On Monday, three lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc at the House of Representatives urged the president to call for a special session of Congress so that the Senate may convene as an impeachment court.

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Bureau of Immigration (BI) relieved seven personnel from their post for suspected involvement in the trafficking of Filipino workers in Myanmar. The employees, assigned to Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) Terminals 1 and 3, are under investigation for allegedly facilitating the illegal departure of trafficking victims, who returned to the Philippines on March 25. “If found guilty of assisting the victims, the employees will face charges before the Department of Justice,” the BI said in a statement. The victims were rescued from online scam syndicates operating in Myanmar and arrived in Manila on a Philippine Airlines flight from Bangkok, Thailand. ADVERTISEMENT BI Commissioner Joel Anthony Viado acknowledged the challenge of identifying trafficking victims at airports, particularly those from affluent backgrounds who often disguise themselves as legitimate tourists. “He said syndicates have adapted by recruiting individuals with clean travel records, making it harder for immigration officers to detect potential victims.” In 2024, the BI intercepted 1,093 trafficking victims, all of whom were referred to the Inter-Agency Council Against Trafficking (IACAT) for further investigation and legal action against their recruiters. Viado said the fight against human trafficking requires a whole-of-government approach to dismantle criminal networks, starting at the grassroots level. He also warned that traffickers continue to exploit backdoor routes to evade stricter immigration controls. ADVERTISEMENT Viado reiterated the need for strong border security and interagency cooperation to combat human trafficking. Earlier this month, the BI reported the repatriation of three trafficking victims from Cambodia, who were forced to work in scam hubs. Investigations revealed they had no official departure records, having been smuggled by boat from Jolo, Sulu, to Sabah, Malaysia, before traveling to Cambodia through Malaysia and Thailand. “Traffickers are always looking for ways to evade detection,” Viado said. “It is crucial that we remain vigilant and work together across agencies to stop these criminal activities.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Three lawmakers from the Makabayan bloc at the House of Representatives urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday to call for a special session of Congress, so that the Senate may convene as an impeachment court for the trial of Vice President Sara Duterte. They issued the statement after Senate President Francis Escudero said that the Senate cannot, on its own, cannot call for a special session. \"Kung talagang bukas ang Pangulo sa special session, dapat ay tahasang gawin na niya ito. Hindi na dapat maghintay pa ng kahilingan mula sa Senate President o House Speaker. The people demand accountability now,\" ACT Teachers Party List Representative France Castro, Gabriela Party List Representative Arlene Brosas, and Kabataan Party List Representative Raoul Manuel said in a joint statement. \"Nakakabahala ang patuloy na pagpapaliban sa impeachment trial. Ang bawat araw na dumadaan ay isang araw na pinapatagal ang hustisya para sa mamamayan. Hindi pwedeng patuloy na gawing hostage ng mga pulitikong may makitid na interes ang impeachment process,\" they added. ADVERTISEMENT But some congressmen from the House majority are against involving the President in the impeachment process, which they said may be perceived as influencing the senator judges. “Baka sabihin naman ng mga kritiko ng ating pamahalaan na ‘pag ang Presidente ang mag-request ng special session, baka sabihin nila, it woud translate into influencing the senator judges at baka sabihin naman nila ito ay political move. So ang position ko dyan is we should not allow the direct participation of the President. It is the sole mandate of Congress, meaning both Houses of Congress to approach the case of an impeachment process,” House Assistant Majority Leader and Lanao del Sur 1st District Representative Zia Alonto Adiong said. “Nasa Senado ‘yung bola. Nasa kanila kung ishoo--shoot or ipapasa,” House Deputy Majority Leader and La Union 1st District Representative Paolo Ortega added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Education (DepEd) has promised to deploy around 15,000 qualified teachers as principals this year, saying the process of hiring principals in public schools is also being reviewed. DepEd stated the report by the Second Congressional Commission on Education (EDCOM II), which showed 55 percent of public schools in the country “operate without principals.” Among the factors on this include the supposedly low passing rates for the National Qualifying Examination for School Heads, high turnover rate of personnel, the lack of qualified candidates, and the “burdensome qualification processes.” The agency, citing EDCOM II’s findings, also cited the insufficient mentoring, coaching, and formal induction programs. ADVERTISEMENT DepEd said to immediately address these issues, the 7,916 NQESH passers in 2024 will be deployed to fill the vacant slots for principals. It will also release interim guidelines “to ensure that principals detailed to offices return to their assigned schools.” “These guidelines will also facilitate the reassignment of surplus principal positions to schools in need,” the release read. Based on the release, Deped will reclassify 14,761 Head Teachers (I-V) as School Principal I as it also implements the Expanded Career Progression Policy. Around 954 Head Teachers VI and Assistant School Principal II positions, DepEd said, will also be retitled as School Principal I. ADVERTISEMENT “Under this process, acting school heads will be prioritized as ‘on-stream candidates,’ ensuring a faster promotion to principal roles. Eligible personnel undergoing retitling will also secure their rightful positions as principals in their designated schools,” DepEd said. These plans aim to achieve a 1:1 principal-to-school ratio by 2026, as the education department also sought to adopt the School Organizational Structure and Staffing Standards. “An additional 5,870 School Principal I positions will also be created to support this initiative,” the release read. Education Secretary Sonny Angara described the lack of principals in schools as an “eye-opener.” “So many of our schools operate without brains—because that’s what our principals are, the brains of our schools. Rest assured, DepEd is taking swift action to address this problem,” said Angara.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Tuesday jested about having a social welfare program for Filipinos who are stuck in situationships, saying that there seemed to be a high demand for it due to the number of people who invested in relationships without labels. The President was speaking about the social welfare department’s Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP) during the agency’s 74th anniversary celebration, when he suddenly went off script and clarified that the SLP does not cover skills training to have a “sustainable love life.” “Kung ang SLP ay para sa love life, siguradong dagsa ang aplikante,” the President said, days after Valentines’ weekend. “Lalo na yung mga nasa situationship, yung invested ka na pero wala pa din label,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT Marcos Jr. proceeded to tease Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian, who has been dubbed as an eligible bachelor since he first rose to power in the early 2000s as a local politician in Valenzuela City. “Mayroon bang training para sa mga pusong laging nalulugi? ‘Yan yun mga ano, personalities without jowa. Nangunguna na diyan ‘yung inyong kalihim,” the President said, laughing. “Masyadong masipag itong ating Secretary, wala nang panahon para magromansa,” he added. Marcos Jr. then reminded government officials to make room for enough rest despite the demands of their job. “Lahat naman sa inyo — the Secretary, the Usecs (undersecretaries) — kahit alas-tres ng umaga ay tumatawag ako, sumasagot. Hindi na ata kayo natutulog,” the President said. ADVERTISEMENT “Matulog naman kayo paminsan minsan at baka kayo ay magkasakit. Kailangan namin ng sigla ninyo,” he said. Gatchalian laughed at the President’s remarks and smiled when asked how long he has been single. “I just don’t talk about it,” the 46-year old DSWD chief told ABS-CBN News. “I’d rather people talk about what we do in the department,” he said.",

ADVERTISEMENT Teodoro did not give a direct answer on whether Washington is interested in increasing the number of Philippine bases it can access, or if discussions would involve the positioning of the US Typhon missiles, a pain point for China. “The content? Let’s wait for the meeting,” he said. “All I can say is we will talk about our existing partnerships, bilaterally and multilaterally and how to move it further,” he said. The US Department of Defense earlier said that Hegseth “will travel to the Philippines to advance security objectives with Philippine leaders and meet with U.S. and Philippine forces.” “Secretary Hegseth's trip comes as the United States builds on unprecedented cooperation with like-minded countries to strengthen regional security,” the statement read. Hegseth’s trip to the Philippines next week will be his first as US President Donald Trump’s defense chief.

The Department of Migrant Workers said Saturday in a release that it was \"closely in touch with local authorities to monitor the case and ensure the welfare\" of Filipinos in Qatar, including the 17 overseas Filipino workers who were being investigated over their political activities. Supporters of former President Rodrigo Duterte staged rallies in various parts of the world on March 28 to mark the former chief executive's 80th birthday. They also protested against his detention in the International Criminal Court detention facility in The Hague. Under Qatar's Law No. 18 of 2004, unauthorized protests and demonstrations are illegal, with public gatherings and protests requiring approval from the government. ADVERTISEMENT The DMW, in coordination with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Embassy in Doha, added that it had sent Labor Attaché Eduard Ferrer, a lawyer, to the police station to provide necessary assistance to the affected OFWs in Qatar. Migrant Workers Secretary Hans Leo Cacdac in the statement reminded all OFWs to adhere to and respect the laws and customs of their host countries. Meanwhile, Migrante Middle East in a statement expressed its deep concern over the recent arrest of Filipino workers in Qatar, urging all OFWs in the Gulf Cooperation Council region to exercise caution in expressing their political views. \"While we acknowledge that every individual has the right to express their opinions, even if we may differ in our political beliefs, we emphasize that this should not compromise their safety or jeopardize their employment abroad,\" the group said. It urged OFWs to take a \"deeper look\" into the political issues in the Philippines, saying it is time to \"stop idolizing political leaders, particularly those from political dynasties, who abandon their campaign promises and duties once elected.\" Migrante Middle East also called on OFWs to refocus their attention on issues that affect their lives and the lives of their families. \"We need to continue fighting for a living wage for Filipino families, genuine agrarian reform, an end to contractualization, and the creation of more job opportunities within the Philippines,\" the group said.",

    "article_body": "Was former president Rodrigo Duterte’s arrest on the basis of the International Criminal Court warrant a form of “state kidnapping” as claimed by Vice President Sara Duterte? Former Supreme Court magistrate Antonio Carpio said Section 17 of Republic Act 9851 or the Philippine International Humanitarian Law may be used to explain why the Philippine government allowed Duterte to be flown to The Hague to face an ICC complaint for crimes against humanity even without a trial in his own country. “Merong batas tayo yung RA 9851, that is the Philippine International Humanitarian Law. Kasi we adopted the Rome Statute into our law. Nakalagay sa section 17, ‘In the interest of justice the relevant Philippine authorities may dispense with the investigation or prosecution of a crime punishable under its act. If another court or international tribunal is already conducting the investigation or undertaking the prosecution of such crime.’” “Instead, the authorities may surrender or extradite suspected or accused person in the PH to the appropriate international court if any or to another state pursuant to the applicable extradition laws and treaties.” ADVERTISEMENT Carpio said the petition for TRO against the arrest warrant is moot and academic since Duterte is already out of the country and will soon be under the jurisdiction of the ICC. He cited the legal doctrine of ‘Male Captus Bene Detentus’ or “wrongly captured, properly detained” amid the Duterte camp’s claim that no warrant was served during the ex-president’s arrest. “The principle says na ‘yung tribunal will have jurisdiction, will continue to have jurisdiction even if the accused is wrongfully arrested because the arrest has nothing to do with the tribunal,” he said. “If the accused is surrendered to the ICC, the circumstances of his arrest by the surrendering state will not be inquired into,” he added. He said the principle is followed in many countries including the US except in cases where there is torture or serious mistreatment. ADVERTISEMENT Philippine authorities arrested Duterte Tuesday on an arrest warrant issued by the ICC. The ICC sought Duterte’s arrest on a crimes against humanity charge in relation to alleged extrajudicial killings occurring between 2011 and 2019. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. later confirmed that an aircraft carrying Duterte to The Hague left Manila at 11:03 p.m.",

Paduano cited a social media post by Lopez that attacked the House panel. ADVERTISEMENT \"It was blatantly obvious that there was a concerted effort to humiliate us and bring us down our knees...

After all, if we indeed are fake news purveyors, the best thing they could do is fight us with their own information dissemination,\" Paduano added. Lopez was ordered detained at the House of Representatives for 10 days.

    "article_body": "MANILA – The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) on Friday vowed to probe illegal recruitment schemes as some Filipinos were trafficked in Myanmar to work for scam centers. DMW Undersecretary Bernard Olalia said the Philippines already has a labor attache in Thailand as they work with their counterparts to rescue Filipinos in Myanmar scam centers. “Pinakaimportante dito is we are trying to get to the bottom of this and we are trying to find out kung sino ang nag-recruit sa kanila kasi kailangan natin ito na huwag ma maulit ang nangyari. Paano sila nadala doon through illegal means offshore,” said Olalia in a press briefing. “We are willing to file the necessary criminal case at sasampahan natin ang mga nag-recruit sa kanila,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT Pressed by the media how many Filipinos were still in Myanmar, Olalia said there were still “some” individuals still stuck in the Southeast Asian nation due to lack of necessary documents to leave. “Pag mayroong ire-rescue, nakaantabay lang ang team doon, tayo ay willing to operate with the [Department of Foreign Affairs],” he said. “Ang challenge kasi natin ay hindi natin sila mauwi nang walang papeles. Ang karamihan sa kanila ay walang visa at ang kanilang pasaporte ay hindi nila hawak kasi tumakas lang. Kailangan natin tulungan sa document,” he said. On Feb. 20, 12 victims who were recruited illegally to work in Myanmar finally came home to the country. The victims said they were recruited through Facebook by another Filipino who offered jobs as customer sales representatives in Myanmar, only to be exploited to work as online scammers there supposedly without pay or rest days. ADVERTISEMENT They were also physically abused, beaten, subjected to electric shocks, and sometimes forced to duck walk, frog walk, jump, and squat for hours. This was why Olalia warned Pinoys not to leave the country through illegal backdoor migration, as there are processes that need to be followed. “Kinakailangan huwag tourist visa ang gagamitin. Dapat palaging employment visa yan at kung maaari ay dadaan sa proseso nang sa ganon,” he said. The Bureau of Immigration earlier also warned that illegal gambling syndicates are now luring Filipinos to work in scam hubs overseas, citing intelligence reports that showed POGOs funding some call center agents to act as \"brand ambassadors\" to promote the illegal jobs.",

    "article_body": "Malacanang on Thursday said it is thankful that majority of Filipinos agree that former President Rodrigo Duterte should be held accountable for the extra-judicial killings done during his term's bloody war on drugs. “Natutuwa po tayo na majority po ng mga taumbayan ay sumasang-ayon sa ginagawa ng pamahalaan,” Presidential Communications Office Undersecretary Claire Castro told TeleRadyo Serbisyo. A Social Weather Stations survey conducted from February 15 to 19 showed that 51 percent of Filipinos believe Duterte must be liable for the drug suspects that have been killed under his administration, while 25 percent said they disagree. Meanwhile, 14 percent indicated they are undecided while 10 percent said they lack knowledge to give an opinion. ADVERTISEMENT The survey asked over 1800 respondents nationwide for their insights. The survey was commissioned by the Stratbase Group. Despite being deemed as a Duterte stronghold, the SWS said Visayas has the highest agreement to holding former Philippine leader accountable for the EJKs at 62 percent. In Mindanao, which is known as Duterte's bailiwick, 47% also agree to holding him liable. In the interview, Castro said the Palace aims to address “fake news” surrounding Duterte’s arrest following the issuance of a warrant by the International Criminal Court. Even the Supreme Court is taking action following a false report that the High Court had issued a temporary restraining order against the arrest and transfer of former president Duterte to The Hague. ADVERTISEMENT She also reminded Vice President Sara Duterte about her duties after the latter followed her father to The Hague in The Netherlands after his arrest. The former president is currently at the ICC’s detention center at The Hague in the Netherlands. He is facing a complaint on crimes against humanity of murder in relation to alleged killings in his years-long brutal drug war. Bato says he has 'no idea' about alleged reward system for cops in drug war The ICC only mentioned about 43 alleged EJK cases, though right groups said there were around 30,000 killings recorded. A hearing to confirm the charges is set at September 23.",

In his speech, Marcos Jr acknowledged the courage, dedication, and patriotism of the AFP leadership, as he reminded them that the evolving security environment requires the military to be innovative, agile, and to have foresight. “This career milestone testifies to the hard work, dedication, and adherence to the fulfillment of your duties as vanguards of your security,”” Marcos Jr said. “As you move forth with your journey on this lifelong commitment to the nation, carry always with you the core values of the AFP. I am certain that you can never go astray so long as you are guided by the time-honored principle of serving with honor and with integrity.” ADVERTISEMENT The President also urged the graduates of foreign academies to be inspired by the achievements of their senior officers as they grow into the AFP organization. “The training, the discipline, the strategies that you acquired abroad will certainly boost our forces’ capabilities especially amidst the increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape,” he said. He said the country will count on them for fresh perspectives to improve national defense and cooperation with other countries. He also assured the officers that the Philippines is resolute in preserving its sovereignty, in part by ensuring regional peace and international cooperation in activities like the recent joint maritime activity with Canada and the United States. Speaking of the May elections, Marcos Jr. said the Philippines is at a “critical juncture” for the integrity of elections and of democracy. “As a nation that deeply values and honors our right to vote, we are counting on the armed forces to ensure a peaceful, credible, and orderly conduct of the electoral process that the Filipinos expect from us. We cannot fail them.”",

    "article_body": "MANILA (2nd UPDATE) — Malacañang on Friday said it will exhaust all legal remedies after Timor-Leste's appeals court rejected the government's request to extradite expelled congressman Arnolfo Teves, who faces criminal cases in the Philippines. \"Hangga’t makakaya ng administrasyon, ilalaban natin ito para sa hustisya para sa mga diumano’y biktima,\" Palace Press Officer Claire Castro said in a briefing. (We will fight on as long as we can for his alleged victims) Teves is facing multiple murder cases in connection with the killing of former Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo and other individuals in 2023. ADVERTISEMENT He was arrested in Timor-Leste in March last year. The Department of Justice announced in June that the extradition request of the Philippines was granted by the Timor-Leste government. Ferdinand Topacio, one of the lawyers of Teves, showed to the media on Thursday a photo of the court document that “unanimously” granted their appeal. The court noted the “well-founded risk of being subjected to torture, inhuman and degrading or cruel treatment” as the reason to reject the extradition. Castro said that the Department of Justice had tried to assure the Timor Leste court that Teves would be safe while being tried in the Philippines. ADVERTISEMENT She said the government will appeal the rejection and show the court that Teves should be sent back to the Philippines. Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Friday said the Philippine government will file a motion for reconsideration before the Timor-Leste Court of Appeal on the extradition. “We are exhausting all remedies possible because the flawed notion that we have a death penalty to implement in this country is crazy. There is no basis for that decision,\" he said. \"So it’s obvious that some people are making money out of this, maybe the lawyers, more than the lawyers,” Remulla said, hinting at potential corruption. The justice secretary stressed that the decision premised on the death penalty and torture that Teves might face are unfounded. ADVERTISEMENT “I don’t know where they are coming from, it’s a decision signed blindly by people who knew nothing about our country,” Remulla said. Remulla also assured the families of the victims of the March 4, 2023 attack, including Pamplona Mayor Janice Degamo, that the DOJ will continue to pursue the multiple murder cases against Teves. “We will have to discuss these things, this is a work in progress, it is not easy to run after a fugitive of this country who has lots of money to burn.",

Trump’s order authorizes economic and travel sanctions targeting people who work on ICC investigations of U.S. citizens or U.S. allies such as Israel. The sanctions coincided with the visit to Washington by Israel's Prime Minister Benajmin Netanyahu, who is wanted by the ICC over the war in Gaza. READ: White House sanctions on the International Criminal Court Speaking to TeleRadyo Serbisyo, Palace Press Officer Claire Castro questioned if the Philippines is included in the list of “major and nonmajor allies” of the US as defined in the Trump EO. “Parang hindi naman tayo included sa list,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT The EO defines the term “ally of the United States” as: In the interview, Castro also criticized Senator Marcos for accusing Malacanang of engaging in a cover-up in the Interpol arrest of former president Rodrigo Duterte last month. She said Cabinet members already spent 6 hours answering Marcos’ questions during the first hearing of her committee. “So anong cover-up dun? Hindi naman pwedeng ibibigay sa kanila o isapubliko ‘yung mga covered ng executive privilege…Sana maintindihan nila ‘yun,” she said. She said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr is not obligated to stop his sister, Senator Imee Marcos, from continuing the investigation. Instead, the President is obligated to reveal to the public all relevant information regarding Duterte’s arrest.

Duterte was arrested in Manila last March 11 following the issuance of an ICC warrant for the crimes against humanity of murder. The ICC only mentioned about 43 alleged EJK cases, though right groups said there were around 30,000 killings recorded.

In a press conference on Thursday, Ortega said Duterte's latest remarks on the authenticity of the documents are just \"excuses\" that can be addressed when Duterte's impeachment trial, expected to begin in late July, starts. \"Meron pong forum at magkakaroon ng impeachment para masagot lahat ng mga tanong natin. Kasi hanggang ngayon ako rin po hindi ko rin alam ang sagot sa mga tanong na yun,\" Ortega added. (There will be a forum at the impeachment to answer all these questions. Until now, I still don't know how they will address that. ADVERTISEMENT Duterte on Wednesday said she cannot answer questions on the matter because she does not know how the lawmakers \"handled the chain of evidence.\" She added she is unsure if the documents in question are the same ones submitted by the Office of the Vice President. Ortega said Duterte has not yet given a clear and direct answer despite repeatedly being questioned on the matter. \"Kasi sabi ko nga if that's a procedure, may procedure po tayo with handling confidential intelligence funds, madali pong sagutin talaga yun. Kasi nga kung sumunod ka sa procedure, at diba mas madali po talagang sagutin pag alam mo,\" he said. (As I said, if that's the procedure, we do have a procedure handling confidential and intelligence funds. It will be easy to answer these questions. Because if you followed the procedure, then that will be easy to answer) ADVERTISEMENT In a statement, Ortega earlier said Duterte's response shows she does not care about the issue \"as she continues to shrug it off.\" The lawmaker pointed out how the numerous fictitious names who allegedly signed the receipts like \"Jay Kamote\" and \"Miggy Mango\" do not have official documents. \"Walang birth certificate, walang marriage certificate, wala rin death certificate,\" he said, referring to Philippine Statistics Authority findings. (They don't have birth certificates, marriage certificates or death certificates) Ortega reminded Duterte to prepare for the impending impeachment trial, while understanding her situation to attend to her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, who is in The Hague, the Netherlands. ADVERTISEMENT “Nung wala pa naman sa The Hague, wala din naman tayong nakuhang sagot. Actually, during the hearings, puro parang ano nga maraming sagutan, maraming drama pero there wasn’t a straight answer na nakuha natin,” he said. (Even when she wasn't at The Hague, we didn't really get an answer. Actually, during the hearings, there was a lot of back and forth, a lot of drama, but no straight answers) The lawmaker is confident they will get answers from Duterte when the impeachment proceedings begin. House Quad Committee Lead Chairperson Robert Ace Barbers of Surigao del Norte said the additional receipts signed by the fictitious names may be used as evidence for the impeachment trial. The issue of alleged misuse of confidential funds is included in the Articles of Impeachment filed by the House before the Senate.

Speaking at a forum organized by the Management Association of the Philippines in Taguig City, Brawner said the planned acquisition will be part of Re-Horizon 3 of the AFP Modernization Program. “Hopefully. It’s a dream for us to get at least two submarines,” Brawner said. “Being an archipelago, we need to have this kind of asset because it is really difficult to defend an archipelago,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT The submarines will strengthen the AFP’s defense capabilities amid China’s continued aggression in the West Philippine Sea. Although he did not give a specific timeline, Brawner said he is hopeful that the submarines will be acquired before the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ends in 2028. “What we need really is funds in order for us to achieve the objectives we have set for Horizon 3. Kulang pa po talaga ang budget na binibigay ng ating gobyerno, kaya’t naghahanap pa tayo ng ibang sources. We are looking at local, then foreign financing,” Brawner told reporters in an ambush interview on the sidelines of the forum. Brawner said the AFP is also expecting the delivery of the first of its two brand-new corvettes from South Korea this year. The Department of National Defense procured two new corvettes from South Korean firm HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI) in 2021 as part of the AFP Modernization Program. ADVERTISEMENT Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. launched the future BRP Miguel Malvar in Ulsan in June last year. “This year, we will be getting two corvettes from South Korea. This is an actual picture of BRP Miguel Malvar that will be sailing this March to the Philippines. We are getting one for this year,” Brawner noted. Corvettes can perform anti-air warfare, anti-surface warfare, and anti-submarine warfare operations. Two more landing docks and six offshore patrol vessels are also in the pipeline for acquisition, according to Brawner.",

ADVERTISEMENT Manalo's attendance at the conference comes amid China's increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea where the West Philippine Sea is located. Beijing claims almost the entire South China Sea that cuts through parts of the West Philippine Sea, a name created by Manila to assert its exclusive economic zone in the waterway. An international court rejected China's assertion and ruled it had no legal basis. However, the superpower dismisses that ruling and continues to insist on its \"rights\".",

    "article_body": "MANILA -- The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) on Tuesday launched online portals for the acquisition of several permits to reduce processing time from 180 days to just one week. The DSWD's Harmonized Electronic Licensing Permit System (HELPS) is a digital one-stop shop for organizations that seek government registration, license to operate and apply for duty exemptions, while the Minors Traveling Abroad (MTA) portal allows the online processing of travel clearances for minors who are traveling abroad alone. \"It has been a nightmare to get registration, accreditation and license to operate permits. Before it would take an average of 6 months… Now, you get to do everything with one simple step,\" DSWD Sec. Rex Gatchalian said during the agency's 74th anniversary celebration in Pasay City. \"Gone are the days when you have to do registration first, come back to us for your license, then come back to us for public solicitation, then come back to us for your duty exempt,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT The DSWD has reduced the number of steps from 49 to just 12 steps, Gatchalian said. \"We want to make sure we bring back simplicity in governance,\" he added. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. lauded the DSWD's digitalization efforts, and the agency's work to provide a \"steady, reassuring presence for many, many Filipinos for countless generations.\" \"These endeavors reflect a government that listens and responds, a government that evolves to meet the needs of its people,\" Marcos Jr. said. \"Your courage, particularly during the recent spate of calamities, has been nothing short of extraordinary,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT The government will continue to support the DSWD's programs as \"the mission does not end here,\" the President said. \"Lasting change is not built overnight… Every single centavo spent, every program implemented must serve a very clear purpose: to create opportunities,\" he said. \"To my fellow Filipinos, the success of these programs does not rest on the DSWD efforts alone. It requires our collective determination, support and our effort,\" he said. Aside from the HELPS and MTA portals, the DSWD is also set to launch a digital initiative that will streamline the agency's donation process. The upcoming \"Kaagapay Donations Portal\" is expected to cater those who seek to send either in-kind or cash donations to the DSWD for disaster relief efforts and care facilities.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Malacañang on Thursday reiterated that it will not cooperate with the International Criminal Court on the crimes against humanity charges against former President Rodrigo Duterte as it does not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC in the Philippines. This was the Palace’s response when asked to comment on a recent statement by the ICC that the Philippine government must first accept the technical measures and conditions before judges would consider any application for the interim release of the former President, who is currently detained at the Hague. “With that, does it mean that we have to recognize that ICC has jurisdiction over the Philippines? I believe the family of former President Duterte is asking and praying from the Supreme Court that the government should not cooperate with the ICC. So, it means that if we will not cooperate with the ICC, even that prayer or even that manifestation of the ICC, we will not recognize as of that,” Palace Press Officer Undersecretary Claire Castro said in a Malacañang briefing. Castro pointed out should the Philippines cooperate with the ICC on the request for Duterte’s interim release, the government will also be constrained to comply with the international tribunal if or when it releases a freeze order for the assets of the Duterte family. ADVERTISEMENT “Mahirap po kasi na sasabihin natin—although, that’s hypothetical, sasabihin natin na makikipag-cooperate tayo sa ICC pagdating po sa interim release dahil lahat po ng isyu diyan ay mabubuksan. Mabubuksan din po kung magkakaroon ng freeze order sa kaniyang mga assets.” “Gugustuhin po ba din ng Pamilya Duterte na makipag-cooperate tayo sa ICC para lahat ng kanilang assets, nakatago man o hindi nakatago, ay makikipagtulungan tayo sa ICC para mahagilap lahat ng kanilang assets?” Castro added. “Though it’s hypothetical, but as we speak now, we do not recognize the jurisdiction of the ICC over the Philippines. So, that’s it.” Duterte was arrested on March 11 on his arrival from Hong Kong at the request of the International Criminal Court (ICC) as part of its probe into his \"war on drugs\" that defined his presidency. The ICC warrant for Duterte's arrest said that as president, the 79-year-old Duterte created, funded, and armed death squads that carried out murders of purported drug users and dealers. He was brought to The Hague in the Netherlands on the same day he was arrested. Duterte on March 14 appeared via video link before ICC judges. He is set to attend a September 25 hearing to confirm the charges against him.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — Four Filipinos in Mandalay are unaccounted for after a 7.7-magnitude earthquake struck Myanmar, according to Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Undersecretary Eduardo De Vega. Two of the four are a married couple, and all four are professionals. Meanwhile, the families of two overseas Filipino workers in Mandalay, Alexis Gale Adalid and Edsil Jess Adalid, continue to plead for help in searching for the two. ABS-CBN News is awaiting confirmation from DFA on whether or not the two individuals are the married couple documented missing. ADVERTISEMENT The OFWs are teachers residing in Sky Villa condominium, one of the many buildings that collapsed due to the earthquake. There are various accounts on where the two are now, according Edsil’s mother, Hermosila Adalid. “Hanggang ngayon wala pa kaming correct na information na na-recover na sila. Kasi nakita namin ‘yung video na ‘yung gumuho, may jacket niya na nakasampay doon sa iron. Then may naghanap sa kanila doon. Tinatawag pangalan niya at pangalan ng asawa doon sa gumuho na structure. ‘Yung debris,” Hermosila Adalid told ABS-CBN News in a Zoom interview, adding they were able to get information from the community of Filipino teachers in Myanmar.4 A comment on the post of her daughter-in-law’s sister claimed the two were already found and are now in the hospital. “Pero ‘di namin alam kung [totoo.] Sana totoo ‘yun,” Hermosila said. Hermosila added she hopes the government would extend help in finding the two as other family members tried to reach out to the Philippine Embassy in Yangon, Myanmar, but cited challenges due to a language barrier. “Wala siyang nakausap na naintindihan kasi iba ang lenggwahe. Parang may chaos pa rin,” Hermosila said. ADVERTISEMENT In an advisory, the Philippine Embassy in Myanmar (Yangon) said it is preparing to deploy a team in Mandalay for “on-the-ground assessment and direct welfare checks on Filipinos in the area.” It also encouraged continued communication among Filipinos in the community for everyone’s safety. \"I’m also hoping po dahil dito—increase of manpower, ganoon—mapapabilis po ‘yung search, operation and rescue for Alex and Edsil kasi more than 48 hours na po silang missing [...] Sana po mayroong progress with all these plans na ginagawa ng embassy ng Pilipinas doon,\" Adalid's sister, Veronica May Concepcion, said regarding the team promised by the Embassy. In an email to ABS-CBN News, the embassy said it is also conducting status verification for all Filipinos in Mandalay. The city has over 1.7-million residents and is among the areas hardest hit by the earthquake. The embassy’s assistance-to-nationals (ATN) hotline (+95 998 521 0991) and the official Philippine Embassy in Myanmar Facebook Messenger is open for those in need of help following the earthquake. ADVERTISEMENT De Vega added there are no reports yet of casualties among Filipinos due to the earthquake. There are also no reports of missing Filipinos in Thailand following the quake. The death toll from the earthquake has reached over 1,600.",

That leaves more than 11,000 of the 33,863 registered foreign POGO workers who are still in the Philippines. \"So yung mga natitira ho dito na non-compliant, yan po yung subject of our law enforcement operations (So those who stayed are non-complaint, they are the subjects of our law enforcement operations),\" BI chief legal officer Arvin Santos told the Senate Committee on Games and Amusements. The Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corp. (Pagcor) told the panel that prior to President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.'s decision to ban POGOs, there were 42 internet gaming licenses, 7 gaming content providers, and 11 support providers in the industry. ADVERTISEMENT All the licenses of those firms have been cancelled, Pagcor Assistant Vice President for Offshore Gaming Licensing Department Jessa Mariz Fernandez told the panel. \"As of January 1, 2025 po, all 42 internet gaming licensees and all 18 authorized providers are already canceled po,\" Fernandez said. Pagcor Senior Vice President for Security and Monitoring Cluster Raul Villanueva told the panel that that those left behind have gone on \"guerrilla\" operations — a term authorities use for smaller operations run in secret . \"We have plenty of targets now because some of these have gone on guerrilla operations already,\" Villanueva said. Villanueva said they have gotten emails from concerned citizens complaining about these rogue POGOs. Pagcor also said they have reported about 276 illegal websites, which included e-sabong, online casino games, and others connected with POGO. However, only 136 have been blocked. Marcos banned POGOs last year after these were linked to illegal activities like kidnapping, online scams, human trafficking and even torture.",

Palace Press Officer Claire Castro noted that the repercussions of such a plan would affect the country’s economy and OFWs’ families. Castro reiterated that Philippine authorities only complied with the law during the former president’s arrest. “Of course, mas gugustuhin po natin na maging mahinahon ang bawat Pilipino sa ganitong klaseng isyu. Sana po ay malaman din po nila na ang pamahalaan at ang gobyerno ay tumutupad lamang sa ating batas. At may mga Pilipino rin naman po na nagreklamo, nag-file ng complaint laban sa dating Pangulong Duterte, sana ay maging patas din po sila sa kanilang pananaw para po maibsan ‘no ang anumang puwedeng kahinatnan ng kanilang gagawin,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT “Pero siyempre po, kung hindi po sila magkakaroon at hindi sila magri-remit ng kanilang mga maaaring ipadala sa mga pamilya nila, hindi lamang po gobyerno ang maaapektuhan, pati ang kanilang mga pamilya. So, sana po ay maging mahinanon tayo sa ganitong mga klaseng issues.” Malacanang said there was no commitment from the Marcos administration on complying with any ICC, following reports that the tribunal could soon release a freeze order on ex-President Duterte’s assets. “When it comes to the alleged incoming freeze order to be issued by the ICC, there is no commitment on our part, on the part of the administration if we will comply with any order issued by the ICC considering that the ICC as of the moment has no jurisdiction over the Philippines,” Castro said. Asked whether the Philippines was looking to rejoin the ICC, the Palace official said there was no directive yet from Marcos on the matter. “As we speak, we have not yet discussed any plan of rejoining the ICC. Iyong huli po nating nakausap ang Pangulo, tinanong po natin iyan nang personal at siya’y ngumiti lamang at sasabihin ko daw dapat na wala pa talagang napag-uusapan patungkol doon,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT The 79-year-old former president faces a charge of crimes against humanity tied to his \"war on drugs\" in which thousands were killed. He is currently in a detention center in The Hague, awaiting a confirmation of charges hearing on September 23, where he will have the opportunity to contest the accusations against him. Duterte was bundled into a plane in Manila and brought to the Hague via Dubai, before facing an initial hearing two days later. Duterte believes he has no case to answer at the International Criminal Court and is confident he has a strong legal argument, his daughter Vice President Sara Duterte said Sunday. \"He's very confident about the legal arguments. He's very confident... that what they did was wrong and there is no case to begin with,\" she told reporters.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Saturday said the Mutual Defense Treaty between the Philippines and the United States is in “constant evolution”, because of the two countries' long history and deep relationship. “The Mutual Defense Treaty is in constant evolution. I’d like to think of it,” Marcos told US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who is in the Philippines for an official visit. “We can no longer isolate one part of our relationship from the other. We are too closely tied because of the special relationship between the United States and the Philippines and the history we share, and all the assistance and help and support that we have received from the US over the years. “They can no longer be categorized as one thing or another because they cover such a large scope.” ADVERTISEMENT Marcos said a \"volatile\" international diplomatic scene — with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and China-Taiwan tensions — highlights \"the importance of the relationship between the United States and the Philippines.\" “I hope that we will continue to evolve that relationship in the face of all the changes that we have been seeing and the changes between bilateral relation between us and the United States,” the President said. Meanwhile, Blinken assured Marcos that the world’s largest economy and military power is committed to keeping its Mutual Defense Treaty with the Philippines. “The alliance is strong … We’re committed to the Mutual Defense Treaty,” Blinken said. “We’re committed to working with you on shared challenges but I think what is so striking to me is we are working together on bilateral issues between us, we are working together in the region, and increasingly, we are working globally because so many of the challenges we face are a global issue.” ADVERTISEMENT Former President Rodrigo Duterte had threatened to cancel the Visiting Forces Agreement, which governs the conduct of American soldiers in the Philippines, after the United States canceled the visa of his ally, Sen. Ronald dela Rosa. Duterte eventually kept the defense pact in place as Chinese incursions in the West Philippine Sea continued throughout his administration. The US State Secretary added that the Philippines-US relationship is “quite extraordinary because it is really founded in friendship.” “It’s forged as well in partnership and it’s strengthened by the fact that it is an alliance as well,” Blinken said. “The people to people ties between us are almost unique and it is something that we tremendously value in the United States just as I know that you do here.” ADVERTISEMENT Marcos told Blinken that he is glad that Washington’s top diplomat could come and visit the Philippines. “Unfortunately with your crushing schedule, I don’t know if you can do any actual visiting,” Marcos said in jest. After his meeting in Malacañang, Blinken is set to meet Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo, travel to a COVID-19 vaccination clinic in the capital city, participate in a clean energy fair in Makati, and visit the employees of the US Embassy in Manila. Bliken is expected to travel to other Southeast Asian and African countries as part of his tour to strengthen the United States’ ties with its allies and partner nations.",

    "article_body": "MANILA - A House lawmaker urged Senator Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa on Thursday to face the allegations before the International Criminal Court over the bloody anti-drug campaign when he was still chief of the Philippine National Police during the Duterte administration. House Assistant Majority Leader and Zambales 1st District Representative Jefferson Khonghun issued the statement after dela Rosa said he felt betrayed by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who supposedly promised that his administration would never cooperate with the ICC. Dela Rosa said he would seek refuge from the Senate for as long as it can protect him from the ICC, amid speculations that an arrest warrant against him was looming, following the Tuesday arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. But “if all legal remedies are exhausted”, dela Rosa said he will turn himself in peacefully. ADVERTISEMENT “Hindi ko alam kung saan nanggagaling si Sen. Bato, pero kailangan niyang harapin ‘yung kaso. We are a country that is governed by certain rules. Talagang kailangan natin harapin ‘yung mga kasong fina-file sa atin at walang exempted doon. So ang suggestion ko nalang kay Sen. Bato is harapin ‘yung mga kaso na kinasasangkutan niya ngayon kasama ang dating Pangulo,” Khonghun said. He reiterated the President’s position that the Philippine government did not cooperate with the ICC, but complied with the country’s commitment to the Interpol, where the ICC warrant for Duterte was coursed through. House Deputy Minority Leader and ACT Teachers Party List Representative France Castro, meanwhile, called on the Marcos Jr. administration to “fully” cooperate with the ICC. In 2019, the Philippines, under Duterte, officially withdrew from the ICC. But the court said that it still has jurisdiction over the alleged crimes that happened while the country was still a member. “Dapat i-full cooperation niya na kasi hindi naman magagawa ni President Duterte ‘yan kung walang nag-execute din nung kanyang mga order… katulad ni Senator Bato dela Rosa... Kung hilingin ng ICC na pumunta or through Interpol na pumunta rin sa Hague ay dapat ay mag-cooperate ang Marcos administration,” Castro said. “Tama lang na tumulong si President Marcos para makakuha ng hustisya and accountability… ‘yung pamilya ng mga biktima… Actually nga, long overdue na ito. Tatlong taon nang nakalipas ‘yung administration ni Presidente Marcos. Dapat nga may ginawa na rin sila para mapanagot din hindi lang si Duterte, pati siya, si Bato, at saka ‘yung iba pang mga pulis,” she added.",

    "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Justice (DOJ) said it is not yet the end of the road for Vice President Sara Duterte, who is facing complaints of grave threats and inciting to sedition filed by the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) before the National Prosecution Service (NPS). Justice Assistant Secretary Mico Clavano said the NPS could send the complaint back to the NBI or call for a preliminary investigation, which may lead to the eventual filing of cases in court. “'Yung antas po na tinitignan ng mga prosecutors ngayon ay hindi na probable cause, ngayon ay reasonable certainty of conviction, at mataas po 'yan na antas or level ng ebidensyang kailangan para magsampa ng kaso,” Clavano said. (The level that prosecutors are looking for now is not probable cause but reasonable certainty of conviction. That is a higher level of evidence need to file a case in court) ADVERTISEMENT He added there is no timetable for the prosecutors to complete their evaluation, which will include checking the completeness of the records submitted and checking \"ministerial matters\" like errors and missing signatures. He also emphasized that while the NPS is under the DOJ, the prosecutors will evaluate the NBI complaints independently. “We have to give them the due independence that they deserve, saka po this is something that has reached national significance and it would be very prudent na bigyan na lang natin sila ng pagkakataon na talagang i-verify at siguro i-analyze and evaluate the complaint,” Clavano said. (This is something that has reached national significance and it would be prudent to give them the opportunity to verify, analyze, and evaluate the complaint) Clavano said Vice President Duterte may be invited to the DOJ to air her side if prosecutors decide to conduct a preliminary investigation. “Kasi karapatan po niya 'yan na magsubmit ng counter-affidavit ng kanyang mga depensa, so we are hoping na gamitin din niya or she will take the chance, the opportunity to clear her name na din,” Clavano said. (Because it is her right to submit a counter-affidavit of her defenses. so we are hoping she will take the opportunity to clear her name)",
