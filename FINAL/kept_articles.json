      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has ordered the review and overhaul of two performance evaluation schemes due to its duplication with existing mechanisms—a move that may affect bonuses given to government employees. Executive Order No. 61 suspended the implementation of the Results-Based Performance Management System and Performance-Based Incentive System, which are effectively bonus schemes. Likely to be affected are the performance evaluation schemes called Productivity Enhancement Incentive, an across-the-board P5,000 bonus given before Dec. 15 of every year, and the the Performance-Based Bonus which may reach up to two months’ worth of a government worker’s basic salary. Both are under the Performance-Based Incentive System. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/454317/public-school-teachers-slam-performance-bonus-introduced-by-palace#ixzz8cZvkk7Pg\">Public school teachers slam performance bonus introduced by Palace</a></strong> EO 61, dated June 3, said both the Performance-Based Incentive System and the Results-Based Performance Management System are “duplicative and redundant” with internal and external audit and evaluation systems and lacked a review mechanism. To review and streamline the bonuses, the President created a technical working group (TWG) composed of the budget secretary as chairperson and the executive secretary as cochair, with the finance secretary, socio-economic planning secretary and director general of the Anti-Red Tape Authority as members. <h2>Transition plan</h2> The TWG will submit recommendations to the President within six months and create a transition plan for the grant of a new performance-based bonus to government employees within the next three months. The new bonus scheme will “integrate, streamline and align the new government performance management system” with other programs and systems as provided for by existing laws and issuances. “The new government performance management and incentives systems shall be aligned with ease of doing business initiatives, the Philippine Development Plan, the socio-economic agenda of the administration and international standards and best practices,” EO 61 read.",

Angara said there was a slow turnover of positions among public school teachers due to a “block” in the Teacher 3 rank. “So above the Teacher 3 position, we will create other teaching positions to pave the way for those down the ranks,” he said, adding that the new ranks would be “plantilla” positions.

Citing the 2021 labor force survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, the CPD said the labor force participation rate is lower for women at 51.2 percent, compared to men at 75.4 percent. As such, the unemployment rate is higher for women at 8.2 percent compared to men at 7.5 percent. There is also a higher proportion of unpaid family women workers, 11.3 percent, compared to men, 4.7 percent. According to a study released in February by the Congressional Policy and Budget Research Department, a think tank of the House of Representatives, more female than male workers have completed secondary and college education. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://entertainment.inquirer.net/600270/womens-month-11-fearless-female-characters-who-redefine-empowerment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Women’s Month: 11 fearless female characters who redefine empowerment</a></strong> The study, citing the 2021 labor force survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority, showed the percentage of women who have completed college at 14.5 percent, compared with the percentage of men at 10.5 percent. Women also dominated completion levels for secondary education at 84.8 percent, as compared with the men’s completion rate at 81.4 percent. <strong>READ:<a href=\"https://www.inquirer.net/womens-month/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">#HerStory: Women Transforming Society</a></strong> In a statement, CPD executive director Lisa Grace Bersales said: “We have come a long way, but we still have more work to do. We need more opportunities, particularly in fields that are dominated by men.” <h2>Family planning</h2> The CPD said the rising numbers of women using family planning methods are “a remarkable progress in the empowerment of women.” It cited a Department of Health report in 2023 showing that more than 8.6 million Filipino women were using family planning methods, higher than the 2022 figure of 8.3 million. “This corresponds to the country’s current state, showing that births among women are lower, at 1.9 children, which is below replacement level,” the CPD said. For modern methods of family planning, pills remain to be the most popular method, with 34.48 percent of the total current users, and injectables coming in second at 20.66 percent. <h2>Implants</h2> Implants had the highest increase in the numbers of users, growing by 24.11 percent. Bersales emphasized the importance of data—particularly disaggregated data—to enable targeted programming and ensure that vulnerable groups, specifically women and girls, indigenous peoples, persons with disabilities, and those in isolated and disadvantaged areas, are effectively reached. The advancement of women from different demographics is among the main thrusts of the Philippine Population and Development Plan of Action 2023-28 that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. approved in November 2023.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Next year’s proposed funding for the feeding of children of P15.795 billion is 45 percent higher than this year’s P10.89 billion and may mean 857 million meals for nutritionally deficient kids. “Never has the budget for child feeding been supersized to this big. On this, the government has put its money where its mouth is,” House Deputy Speaker and Batangas Rep. Ralph Recto said over the weekend, noting that the program was “unprecedented.” A check of the 2024 National Expenditure Program showed that the <a href=\"https://www.deped.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Education</a> (DepEd) requested P11.711 billion for its school-based feeding program, while the <a href=\"https://www.dswd.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Social Welfare and Development</a> (DSWD) asked for P4.084 billion for its supplementary feeding program. These sums are higher than the P5.69 billion and P5.2 billion approved for these programs under the 2023 spending law. The proposed funding for feeding programs for kids in 2024 is P4.9 billion higher than this year’s approved allocations. <h2>Big catering operation</h2> Recto said the P15.795 billion may translate to 857 million meals for nutritionally deficient children, at current prices. “Costing for 2024 might still be adjusted to inflation, but it will not change the fact that the two agencies will have in their hands a big catering operation next year,” he said. Recto cited data from the two agencies, which showed that for 2023, the DepEd will provide 1,678,704 students one meal a day for 120 days, while DSWD will serve one meal for 120 days to 1,754,637 beneficiaries. The DepEd’s school-based feeding program caters to students from Kindergarten to Grade 6 who come from indigent families and are suffering from child wasting or stunting. On the other hand, the DSWD’s supplemental feeding program is for children aged 3 to 5 years old who are placed in daycare and other child development centers. <h2>Better canteens sought</h2> Recto said the increase in the budget for school-based feeding should be accompanied by higher funding for food preparation and handling facilities, cooking equipment, and canteens. “Procuring more of these serves a dual purpose as these facilities can become teaching laboratories for senior high students taking culinary classes under the technical-vocational track. They can feed the body and feed the mind at the same time,” he said. He added that the P15.795 billion funding for the two agencies may also help local farmers and food producers if schools will buy from them. “In essence, it is a food purchase budget, which can be spent locally, resulting in a virtuous cycle wherein food grown by the village will end up being consumed by their children,” Recto added. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1703436/hunger-in-ph-real-solutions-needed-astronaut-meals-not-included\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hunger in PH: Real solutions needed (astronaut meals not included)</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1684002/deped-plans-to-transfer-feeding-program-to-lgus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DepEd plans to transfer feeding program to LGUs</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1681160/in-finland-school-meals-keep-students-going\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">In Finland, school meals keep students going</a></h3>",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A total of P544 billion in lump sum appropriations in the proposed budget of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) for 2023 may just end up as pork barrel of lawmakers, Senate Minority Leader Aquilino “Koko” Pimentel III warned on Sunday. “Budgeting via lump sums does not conform to the spirit and requirements of our budget law and policy,” Pimentel told the Inquirer. “Lump sum funds lack details. The policy of the law is ‘line item budget,’ meaning ‘as detailed as possible.’ Lump sum [budgeting] is the work of lazy people,” he added. Such budgeting practice, he noted, “lacks transparency. Hence, it is not to be desired.” “What I fear the most is that it could be a rich source of pork barrel funds. That is why DPWH should disaggregate them and publicize the details immediately,” Pimentel said in a separate statement. In 2013, the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional the allocation of pork barrel, officially known as Priority Development Assistance Fund, and similar lump sum allotments in the national budget. According to the Senate minority leader, the unspecified allotments were about 75 percent of the DPWH’s proposed budget of P718 billion as stated under the Marcos administration’s P5.3-trillion <a href=\"https://www.dbm.gov.ph/index.php/dbm-publications/national-expenditure-program\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">National Expenditure Program</a> (NEP) for next year. Last week, the House of Representatives concluded its plenary debates on President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.’s first national spending program as it approved the NEP, which would then be transmitted to the Senate as the General Appropriations Bill. “This is no small amount,” Pimentel said. “Every peso in the budget should be disaggregated. Hiding billions of pesos in lump sum funds is nothing new. Let’s shun this practice.” Among the questionable outlay was P214 billion for “convergence and special support programs,” which included P105 billion for Sustainable Infrastructure Projects Alleviating Gap and P52 billion for Basic Infrastructure Program. <strong>RELATED STORIES</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1664488/pork-trading-replaces-horse-trading-in-19th-congress\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pork trading replaces horse trading in 19th Congress</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1673759/koko-having-confidential-funds-not-a-deped-norm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Having confidential funds not a DepEd norm – Pimentel</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1672191/minority-calls-out-huge-confidential-funds-in-2023-budget-couldve-been-for-classrooms-cash-aid\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Minority calls out huge confidential funds in 2023 budget</a></strong>",

With God’s mercy, I have no more symptoms and I am feeling better,” the president said in Filipino at the start of the 3-minute, 18-second video filmed in a Malacañang bedroom he described as the one he slept in during his late father’s rule. It was Marcos’ 219th vlog cross-posted on his Facebook and YouTube pages and the third since he took office on June 30. In his latest video, which drew 310,000 views on Facebook and 140,000 on YouTube as of mid-Sunday, the president assured his followers that he was in good health and thanked them for their well wishes on social media, some of which were flashed on screen. “I’d like to report, if you’re wondering where I am making this vlog for you, this is my old bedroom. I used to sleep here when my father was still president,” Marcos said. Malacañang announced on July 8 that the president tested positive for the coronavirus, but he showed no major symptoms except a mild fever. He stressed the importance of getting the vaccine or booster shots. “This is my second bout with COVID but I think that if it were not for the vaccine and booster shot, then perhaps my condition would be a lot worse off,” he said. <h6><em>—DJ YAP</em></h6> <strong>RELATED STORIES</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1628620/bongbong-marcos-ends-isolation-after-bout-with-covid-19-palace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos ends isolation after bout with COVID — Palace</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1627401/bongbong-marcos-now-free-from-covid-19-symptoms-may-end-isolation-on-friday-palace\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos now free from COVID symptoms — Palace</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1626019/bongbong-marcos-on-way-to-complete-recovery-after-covid-19-bout-says-doc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos on his way to ‘complete recovery’ after COVID-19 bout, says doc</a></strong> &nbsp;",

      "article_body": "Eager to put the past weeks behind her, Vice President Sara Duterte expressed hope that the criticisms over the lack of transparency in her request and use of confidential funds would “eventually lose its charm,” while deflecting questions about her use of public money by saying Alliance of Concerned Teachers Rep. France Castro and Sen. Risa Hontiveros were being dramatic. On Monday, Duterte thanked President Marcos, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, and Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo for defending how her office got P125 million in confidential and intelligence funds (CIF) when there was no line item for it under the 2022 General Appropriations Act. Several experts, including the Makabayan bloc, former Senate President Franklin Drilon, and former lawmakers Barry Gutierrez and Neri Colmenares, have pointed out that it was unconstitutional to realign funds to nonexistent budgetary items, more so without prior approval of Congress. But instead of answering squarely, Duterte said only she believed “the lies they peddled to the public will eventually lose their charm and the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the Department of Education (DepEd) will persist and be vindicated.” <strong>‘Flair for drama’</strong> She also came after Hontiveros, who interrogated her during the OVP budget deliberations last week and whom she said “amuses the nation with her flair for drama, could only wish the 2022 OVP CIF was accessed illegally.” “It’s a shame they still cannot produce any proof to support their dirty imagination,” she added. Duterte said the arguments on the unconstitutionality of the CIF were “a legal opinion of Ms Castro, who is not a lawyer/auditor.” Castro, who has butted heads with Duterte over her policies at DepEd, led the charge in interrogating the OVP’s confidential funds after discovering that they were spent in just 19 days last year. Hontiveros, for her part, on Monday reminded Duterte that she is “not special.” “Given the significant responsibility of government officials, I demand a shred of competence when it comes to fiscal matters—like any Filipino taxpayer,” Hontiveros said in a statement. Contrary to the Vice President’s claim that the senator was just “amusing” the public with her “flair for drama,” Hontiveros said she was just doing her job to scrutinize the spending plans of the OVP like all other state agencies. <strong>Secret funds for DMW</strong> “No drama. We just work hard,” she said. Amid the controversy over confidential funds, Sen. Raffy Tulfo on Monday sought P25 million in secret funds for the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) to fund its covert operations. The DMW has requested a budget of P15.5 billion for 2024. The proposal, however, was met with opposition by some of his colleagues, including Sen. JV Ejercito, who said it would be better to just strengthen the DMW’s existing programs to combat human trafficking. Senate Minority Leader Aquilino Pimentel III and Senate Majority Leader Joel Villanueva also expressed their reservations over Tulfo’s suggestion.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Healthcare workers have slammed the proposal of the Commission on Higher Education (CHEd) to implement “exit credentials” to address the shortage of nurses in the country, calling it a mere “band-aid solution.” Ronald Ignacio, a registered nurse and one of the conveners of United Private Hospital Unions of the Philippines, said such a plan would affect the quality of care provided by Filipino nurses to patients. “I think it is a mere band-aid solution. This isn’t long-term. And [patients] would question the quality of service because [the nurses] don’t have experience,” he said at a recent press briefing. Filipino Nurses United vice president Leni Nolasco also criticized the CHEd’s plan as the government should instead solve the problem of low wages that discourage registered nurses to practice their profession, thereby causing understaffing in hospitals. Nolasco told the Inquirer on Saturday that there was “no shortage issue, but understaffing” in hospitals. “Raising the salaries of private health workers to match those in the government is a good start. But the nurses’ salaries are not enough,” she said. Her group has demanded a P50,000 starting salary per month for nurses in the country, calling it a “living wage.” President Marcos earlier directed the CHEd to carry out interventions to curb the growing number of nurses who either migrate abroad or switch to a more stable career. Last month, CHEd Chair Prospero de Vera III said his agency would facilitate the signing of memoranda of agreement between the private sector and higher education institutions on the direct hiring of nursing graduates in healthcare facilities, particularly those with “exit credentials.” The proposed shorter program will allow those who completed only one to three years of nursing studies to join the profession and augment the medical workforce. Based on data from the Department of Health, about half of the 316,405 licensed Filipino nurses had migrated to other countries. According to Nolasco, a third of this number have chosen not to practice nursing and instead look for more lucrative job opportunities. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1751515/scholarship-return-program-eyed-to-solve-nurses-shortage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Scholarship, return program eyed to solve nurses shortage</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1750723/zubiri-want-nurses-to-stay-in-ph-then-increase-their-salaries\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zubiri: Want nurses to stay in PH?

EO No. 44 also directs the agency to work with other government offices and local governments which, in turn, are ordered to provide the DSWD their full support and cooperation. In addition, the DSWD was tasked to determine the “appropriate staffing pattern and corresponding qualification standards” for the creation of additional positions for the administration and operation of the food stamp program. The department must also submit to the <a href=\"https://www.dbm.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Budget and Management</a> the proposed changes in the agency’s organizational structure and staffing pattern. <h2>Development goals</h2> The food stamp project aims to lower the incidence of voluntary hunger in low-income households by providing P3,000 in financial aid through Electronic Benefit Transfer cards, which can be used to buy selected food commodities from eligible partner merchant stores. A whole-of-government approach is required for the program to succeed, as the EO itself noted. Its implementation is in line with the country’s commitment to realizing the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal No. 2 of ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030.

We, of course, we have to apologize to our kababayans who, especially those who came from abroad because their vacation is limited,” Marcos told reporters in an interview after he inspected Ninoy Aquino International Airport (Naia) Terminal 3. Despite the airport chaos, Marcos believed that airport authorities and his Cabinet officials “have done a reasonably good job,” saying that “six hours is rather a short time considering how much [was] needed to be done to get the system back up into working condition.” <h2>‘Back to normal’</h2> He said operations at Naia were now “back to normal” but he said the Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines (Caap) must have “a proper backup system” to prevent similar incidents happening in the future. “That’s why we are asking for your forgiveness. But we’ll do everything we can to make sure it doesn’t happen again,” he assured travelers. <h2>Proper backup system</h2> He ordered Transportation Secretary Jaime Bautista to “fast-track” all negotiations for the upgrade of equipment at the country’s airports. “What I told [Transportation] Secretary Jimmy [Bautista] is to make sure that we fast-track all of—whatever negotiations we have with our—with the equipment suppliers who can help us with the upgrades, for the software and the hardware of our equipment,” he said. “And beyond that, is to have a proper backup system so if the whole system fails, like it did on Jan. 1, we have a complete system ready to go,” he added. On New Year’s Day, about 56,000 passengers were stranded at Naia and other airports in the country after 361 flights to and from Manila were either canceled, diverted or delayed. Both the Senate and the House of Representatives have called for an investigation of the fiasco. <h3></h3> <h3>RELATED STORIES:</h3> <h3 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1712172/senators-seek-thorough-probe-of-naia-fiasco\">Senators seek thorough probe of Naia fiasco</a></h3> <h3 class=\"entry-title\"><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1711413/naia-power-outage-tech-glitch-shut-ph-airspace#ixzz7pdgspadj\">Naia power outage, tech glitch shut PH airspace </a></h3>",

Conducted between Dec. 12, 2024 and Dec. 18, 2024, the survey showed that 41 percent of Filipinos support the Vice President’s impeachment, while 35 percent disagree and 19 percent are undecided. The rest, 5 percent, said they “don’t know enough” about the issue. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2021731/more-endorsers-back-4th-impeach-rap-vs-vp#ixzz8wlgewUMW\">More endorsers back 4th impeachment rap vs VP Duterte</a></strong> According to the survey results, the call for Duterte’s impeachment resonated most strongly in Luzon outside of Metro Manila, with 50 percent advocating for her removal and 25 percent disagreeing with it. Only 18 percent were undecided while 7 percent were not informed enough. <h2>Most opposed region</h2> This was followed by Metro Manila, with 45 percent agreeing to the call for impeachment. A close 37 percent disagreed and only 14 percent said they were undecided. The remaining 4 percent said they did not know enough. Mindanao showed the most opposition, with 56 percent opposing it and 22 percent advocating for it. The region had an undecided rate of 18 percent and 4 percent uninformed. The Visayas had the highest percentage of undecided respondents at 24 percent, in contrast to 40 percent who agreed, 33 percent who disagreed and 4 percent who did not know enough. Among socio-economic classes, support for the impeachment was strongest among Classes ABC, with 50 percent agreeing, 34 percent disagreeing and 14 percent undecided. Opposition to the impeachment was strongest in Class E, with a disagreement rate of 36 percent; however, the agreement rate in this sector was 37 percent, while the undecided rate was 20 percent. <h2>Refusal to answer</h2> Across sectors, 2 percent of Class ABC, 5 percent of Class D and 7 percent of Class E said they lacked knowledge about the issue. The survey results also showed that 46 percent of Filipinos believe the unexplained spending of confidential funds by the Office of the Vice President and the Department of Education may be the best basis for Duterte’s impeachment. Her refusal to answer investigations into these funds was also a concern for 36 percent of Filipinos. Accusations of ill-gotten wealth that could not be explained in her statement of assets, liabilities and net worth (SALN), and threats to the lives of prominent figures, including President Marcos, also ranked highly with 25 percent and 24 percent of Filipinos, respectively, believing them to be possible bases for her impeachment. <h2>Other issues</h2> Other allegations include Duterte’s involvement in extrajudicial killings during her tenure as Davao City mayor (23 percent), her failure to condemn China’s aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea (13 percent), her display of lack of self-control (12 percent), her trip to Germany during the onslaught of Typhoon “Carina” (11 percent), and ordering her subordinates to prepare accomplishment reports on the distribution of confidential and intelligence funds, supported by fabricated receipts and documents (11 percent). Around 17 percent of Filipinos stated that none of the mentioned allegations may be the basis for her impeachment. The survey involved 2,160 respondents with a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points.",

DOTr Secretary Vince Dizon first identified the ROW issues as the main reason for the delays of the many flagship and priority projects of the administration when he recently met with Senate Deputy Majority Leader JV Ejercito. <strong>READ:<a href=\"https://business.inquirer.net/507850/dizon-wants-to-solve-right-of-way-issues-that-delay-govt-infra-projects\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dizon wants to solve right of way issues that delay govt infra projects</a></strong> &nbsp; “His (Dizon) concern is the right of way and that’s the one that’s really causing the delay of the projects and at the same time it was placed in the unprogrammed funds for a while,” Ejercito said in a Zoom interview on Wednesday. The senator was asked if there was a commitment from the DOTr about the major infrastructure projects that may be completed before the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., ends in 2028. Ejercito lamented the delays in the implementation of some projects that fell under the government’s unprogrammed funds in the past budget law. <h2>Programmed allocation</h2> This was also the reason he insisted that all flagship programs should fall under the programmed allocation. But the DOTr is not just hoping for allocation but legislation that would address the ROW issues to expedite the completion of the government’s priority projects, according to the senator. “He emphasized that for the project to move forward, there really needs to be a budget allocation, and at the same time, the right-of-way bill must be passed so they won’t keep encountering difficulties—since legal issues are usually the main problem,” Ejercito said in Filipino. “That’s what he requested, along with airport upgrades, to help decongest NAIA,” Ejercito added. In particular, Dizon talked about allowing other provincial airports to operate at night to “spread out the flight, instead of all trying to beat the 5 o'clock sunset limitation.” /MR",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) plans to carry out an ongoing trial run of African swine fever (ASF) vaccines bought from Vietnam in even more areas to help hog farmers find a cure for the viral disease. In a statement on Monday, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the DA “[would] cast a wider net” to include areas in Luzon and regions designated as red zones (with active ASF cases) in Visayas and Mindanao. He added that 150,000 doses of the ASF vaccine would be used to inoculate hogs in La Union, Quezon, Mindoro, North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat and Cebu provinces as part of the controlled testing being conducted by the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI). <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://plus.inquirer.net/business/da-expecting-440000-asf-vaccines-to-arrive-in-oct/\">DA expecting 440,000 ASF vaccines to arrive in Oct</a></strong> Commercial pig farms in areas with numerous infections will also be covered to safeguard their stocks. All vaccines will be provided free of charge. “Our goal is to ensure a steady supply of pork in the market and stabilize prices,” Tiu Laurel said. This marked the first time the government conducted controlled vaccine testing after it recorded the first ASF outbreak in the country in 2019. The DA earlier earmarked P350 million for the program: P300 million for the procurement of about 600,000 doses of Vietnamese-made ASF vaccines and P50 million for inoculation-related costs. The first shipment covering 10,000 doses arrived last month. Another 150,000 doses were later delivered, but these have yet to be used. Among the initial recipients of the ASF vaccines in an inoculation drive conducted on Aug. 30 were 41 hogs in Lobo town, Batangas province—ground zero of the ASF resurgence in the country. Five of the hogs, however, eventually died, Lobo Mayor Lota Manalo said during a hearing conducted by the Senate committee on agriculture, food, and agrarian reform. Over the weekend, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa said the remaining 440,000 doses were expected to arrive and be released within October to sustain the government-controlled vaccination campaign. The country has active ASF cases in 14 regions, 31 provinces, and 109 municipalities, based on the BAI’s tally as of Sept. 6. ASF is a highly contagious viral disease afflicting domestic and wild pigs with a possible mortality rate of 100 percent, according to the World Organization for Animal Health. While considered not a danger to human health, the disease can have devastating effects on pig populations and the farming economy. The industry-wide losses to the country’s swine sector have been estimated at around P100 billion. The total swine inventory also dipped by 2.1 percent to 9.86 million heads as of September last year, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority.",

According to the DSWD, a total of 18,055 college students will undergo a five-day training program for its cash-for-work tutoring program, called “Tara, Basa!” tutoring program, next month. Other topics to be discussed in the mentor training sessions are basic gender and cultural sensitivity, financial literacy, and an “in-depth orientation” on their tasks as tutors and youth development workers. “We are preparing these students not just to teach, but to become holistic support systems for both children and parents,” DSWD spokesperson Irene Dumlao said in a statement. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://opinion.inquirer.net/178877/reviving-basic-education\">Reviving basic education</a></strong> A guidebook for tutors and a workbook for learners will also be provided to the program participants to serve as their reference materials in the sessions. These were developed by the DSWD with the Ateneo Center for Educational Development and the Department of Education. The tutors and youth development workers, mostly education majors in college, will receive compensation based on the prevailing regional daily minimum wage rate over the 20-day learning session. Tutors will guide elementary students having difficulties in reading, while the youth development workers will hold “Nanay-Tatay teacher sessions” with the parents or guardians of the students to espouse “positive parenting” and other related topics such as Filipino family dynamics and understanding oneself as a parent. One of the tutors in the program, third-year college student Jomel Sabalboro from Albay, said that his role goes beyond teaching, as it is important to also “create meaningful learning experiences tailored to the needs of the struggling learners.” <h2>Teachers’ training, too</h2> “I thought my role was simply to teach struggling readers using printed materials, like storybooks. However, through the sessions, I realized that my responsibilities go far beyond that,” he said in the DSWD statement. For this year, the program, deemed supplementary learning sessions, was further expanded to a total of 12 regions, namely Metro Manila and the regions of Ilocos, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Bicol, Central Visayas, Eastern Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, Northern Mindanao, Soccsksargen, and Caraga. It had a pilot run in Metro Manila when it was launched in 2023, before it was introduced to six other regions.",

Marcos said there were six or seven major <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1858826/dof-chief-diokno-maharlika-fund-irr-revisions-within-bounds-of-law\">changes</a> and they dealt with the powers and authorities of the board of directors of the Maharlika Investment Corp. (MIC) that will manage the fund. The revised rules also gave the President freedom to accept or reject nominees to the MIC board, an advisory body to be composed of the finance, budget socioeconomic planning secretaries and the national treasurer. The president said he preferred to let the board of directors decide as much as possible even with the choice of people, and the structure of the organization. “As much as possible, on the day-to-day workings of the fund, we leave it to the board. We leave it to the managers,” Marcos said, reiterating that “I do not want political forces to interfere with financial decisions of the investment fund.” The president did not specify what “political forces” he meant but stressed that the MIC was not any different from other government corporations, like the Land Bank of the Philippines and the Development Bank of the Philippines, which will provide the bulk of MIC’s capitalization.",

These included requiring local governments to adjust their office hours from 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., and prohibiting electric-powered bikes, tricycles and trailer tractors on major roads. “While we understand the intention behind the proposal, I’ve decided to prioritize discipline over penalties,” Marcos said. <strong><em>—MELVIN GASCON</em></strong>",

PAF 15th Strike Wing commander Brig. Gen. Juliano Llarenas said during the decommissioning ceremony over the weekend that a contract was signed for six additional Super Tucano aircraft on Dec. 27. “Hopefully, the notice to proceed will be issued today,” he said during the ceremony on Saturday at Sangley Point in Cavite City, which was aired live on Facebook. He did not provide details. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2017034/keep-modernization-a-priority-marcos-tells-paf-at-turnover-rites#ixzz8vuk2zUb9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Keep modernization a priority, Marcos tells PAF at turnover rites</a></strong> Brazil’s Embraer SA delivered the first batch of six Super Tucano aircraft for the PAF worth P4.698 billion in 2020. But even with the additional aircraft, the PAF has a long way to go to reclaim its title of being the finest in the Asean region. <h2>Lack of funds</h2> Over the years, its air assets have declined with no replacements coming in due to funding problems and the painstaking process involved in the country’s military modernization program. The last two OV-10 Broncos retired over the weekend were operated by the 15th Strike Wing, which is responsible for tactical and close air support for the military’s ground operations. The PAF unit used to operate over 30 aircraft, which were acquired from the United States and Thailand, making the OV-10 its stalwart workhorse since the 1990s. The two AH-1S Cobras, the PAF’s first pair of dedicated attack helicopters, were donated by the Kingdom of Jordan only in 2019. These were previously operated by the Royal Jordanian Air Force and Israeli Air Force. Sourcing spare parts, however, became a challenge in maintaining the ageing air assets, prompting the PAF leadership to decide to finally retire them, Llarenas said in his speech. “We do not mourn an end but celebrate a legacy. Their decommissioning marks the culmination of years or decades of steadfast service and heralds a new era of innovation and progress built upon the foundation of their enduring contribution to our nation’s defense,” he said. The Philippines was one of the last operators of the legendary Vietnam War vintage OV-10s, which patrolled the West Philippine Sea and saw action in numerous internal security operations against the New People’s Army and Abu Sayyaf Group, including the Marawi siege in 2017.

(PhilHealth) is set to increase again the benefit package for each session of hemodialysis, which will lessen the out-of-pocket payments of patients with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD5). But there’s a catch: Despite the increase in the benefit package, the PhilHealth board has also allowed private dialysis providers to charge patients out of pocket, if there are services needed beyond the “minimum standards of care.” According to Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa, chair of the PhilHealth board, PhilHealth increased the new rate to P6,350 from the previous P4,000 per dialysis session in both public and private dialysis units. Herbosa said the decision to increase the cash rate by 58.75 percent was reached by the board on Wednesday, “following the guidance of President Marcos” <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1945943/philhealth-eyes-100-percent-hike-in-coverage-for-dialysis-patients#ixzz8lutSs8j6\">PhilHealth eyes 100 percent hike in coverage for dialysis patients</a></strong> Last week, Herbosa convened the PhilHealth benefits committee, which heard feedback from hospitals, dialysis centers, and the Philippine Society of Nephrology about the “persistent challenges of dialysis.” Herbosa said “we have also reminded [the PhilHealth] management to work fast on urgent care and emergency benefits to complete the picture,” referring to the needed circular and operationalization so that the higher rate can be claimed. This will be the second time this year that the health insurance agency increased its case rate for hemodialysis since June. PhilHealth earlier increased the case rate from P2,600 to P4,000 for each hemodialysis session for CKD5 patients. It also increased the maximum number of hemodialysis sessions from 90 to 156, equivalent to P990,600 a year under the new rate. But now, nephrologists in private dialysis units are allowed to bill an additional fee of up to P450 for services rendered and private dialysis centers can charge for medicine or procedures not considered under minimum standards. This also means that only publicly accredited dialysis centers are prohibited from billing additional charges to their CKD5 patients under the “no balance billing” system. Based on the current circular, included in the minimum standards for CKD5 patients are erythropoietin, intravenous iron sucrose, and heparin or enoxaparin. There are also eight laboratory tests, which a CKD5 patient may take “any or all, as needed:” complete blood count; serum creatinine; hepatitis profile; alkaline phosphatase; potassium, phosphorus, calcium; serum iron/ferritin/transferrin; total iron binding capacity; and albumin.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Labor groups marked Bonifacio Day on Saturday with protest-marches on España Boulevard and Mendiola Street in Manila to demand government action on pressing issues confronting workers amid bickering by the country’s various political factions. The Nagkaisa Labor Coalition reiterated its call for a legislated wage hike of P150 or more and the abolition of provincial rates to help workers cope with the rising cost of living. It also renewed pleas to government to abolish contractualization in both public and private sector. The coalition lamented that while marathon hearings continue to be held at the House of Representatives on the war on drugs of the previous administration and the alleged misuse of confidential funds by the Vice President, the labor committee stopped deliberating on the legislated wage hike. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2010863/despite-scrapped-house-hearing-vp-duterte-still-no-show-at-nbi#ixzz8t5inpl3C\">Despite scrapped House hearing, VP Duterte still no-show at NBI</a></strong> While exacting accountability from the past administration is “a good agenda” to pursue, Nagkaisa said sidelining key labor reforms, such as legislating wage hike and ending labor contractualization, is tantamount to “perpetuating a state of national calamity.” Nagkaisa also emphasized the compounding effects of recent typhoons, which have devastated communities across the country. “This situation reflects decades of government neglect and the self-serving priorities of political dynasties, reaffirming Bonifacio’s belief that there can be no ‘kaginhawahan’ (comfort) ‘kalayaan’ (freedom) from this kind of rule,” it said. The coalition argued that both the coalescing and warring political dynasties are importunate barriers to genuine progress for Filipino workers. <h2>Who will benefit?</h2> The Partido Manggagawa said that amid the “intense” political infighting between the camps of the President and Vice President, “workers [should] choose no sides and will not join any ‘fake people power,’” according to Judy Miranda, the group’s secretary general. This was also the sentiment of the Bukluran ng Manggagawang Pilipino (BMP) and the Kilusang Mayo Uno. “When the new year entered, both the Marcos and Duterte factions did not attend to anything, but their rivalry for the 2025 and 2028 elections. The continuing and intensifying telenovela of the antagonistic ‘Team Kasamaan’ and ‘Team Kadiliman’ is getting tiresome. These are the [political] dynasties that have been neglectful of the poverty [among Filipinos] and which prioritize the interest of their clans,” BMP said in a statement.",

The DOTr underscored on Sunday that this strategy, which would support vital economic sectors like agriculture and trade, was part of the Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028. “New linkages and strategic location of new ports will be assessed to create new rural growth areas. The capacity of Ro-Ro (roll-on, roll-off) facilities will be increased and processes will be digitized to address congestion and delays,” the DOTr said. Electronic terminal management systems such as electronic ticketing will also be implemented and streamlined while aging fleets will be replaced or retrofitted to mitigate the risk of maritime accidents, it added. Meanwhile, the Maritime Industry Development Plan will continue to be implemented through maritime education, technology and innovation. <h2>Complete missing links</h2> The DOTr also plans to upgrade land routes aligned with the nautical highway network and complete the missing links in the road network by constructing viable inter-island bridges. “Road transport corridors leading to airports and ports will be upgraded, including installation of weighbridges to prevent overloading,” it said. Also on Sunday, the DOTr reiterated its plan to give pedestrians and cyclists the highest priority in the hierarchy of road users. “Provisions for active mobility will be integrated into the transportation system. Existing thoroughfares and bridges will be redesigned and retrofitted for the protection and expansion of bikers and pedestrians,” it said. <h2>Bike-only roads</h2> To ensure safe and well-connected active mobility networks, the DOTr intends to widen sidewalks, develop greenways, car-free zones, and bike-only roads and reconstruct intersections. “Local governments and private developers will be incentivized to have pedestrian-friendly and bikeable developments and programs,” the DOTr said. The local governments will also be encouraged to monitor walk scores, walkability, bikeability, and accessibility within their jurisdictions. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1708570/ppa-passenger-count-in-ports-reaches-pre-covid-levels-during-christmas-rush\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPA: Passenger count in ports reaches pre-COVID levels during Christmas rush</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1636061/normal-operations-no-major-structural-damage-in-eight-ports-after-abra-earthquake-ppa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Normal operations, no major damage in 8 ports after earthquake – PPA</a></h2>",

According to him, the CPU will hold a “child protection specialization course” for focal persons in regional and school division offices in November. “There is also a training needs survey that is being conducted in order to identify the training that should be provided at the school level,” Poa said in a Viber message to the Inquirer. “Aside from these, information drives will be undertaken which will include the dissemination of IEC (information, education and communication) materials on bullying at the school level,” he added. DepEd earlier launched hotlines to receive complaints about abuses being committed in schools following reports about sexual abuse cases involving teachers at the basic education level. During the press briefing, the <a href=\"https://www.cwc.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Council for the Welfare of Children</a> (CWC), an interagency body mandated to protect minors, said that it would also introduce a hotline called “Makabata Helpline 1383” to deal with child rights’ violations. CWC executive director Angelo Tapales said the hotline would complement those being operated by the National Center for Mental Health (NCMH) and other concerned agencies. He added that since the Philippines did not have enough resources to support the big infrastructure needed for a centralized emergency hotline, those set up separately by different agencies should complement each other with the aid of a proper referral system. “In the helpline, NCMH is focused on mental health while we are focused on the violation of children’s rights. We would start with violence and dangers that they might be facing,” Tapales said. “What we need is a proper referral system,” he added, noting that if the caller was seeking treatment or therapy, that person should be directed to the agency specializing in those areas. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1682703/hontiveros-hails-blocking-of-20-child-abuse-sites-new-anti-osaec-law-is-working\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hontiveros hails blocking of 20 child abuse sites: New anti-OSAEC law is working</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1679199/3-fold-surge-in-online-child-abuse-cases\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Solon seeks probe into ‘three-fold surge’ in online child abuse cases</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/851437/cwc-unicef-bare-results-of-national-study-on-child-abuse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CWC, Unicef bare results of national study on child abuse</a></h2>",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The majority of senators will have the final say on whether or not the 2025 funding of the Office of the Vice President (OVP) will be increased, Senate President Pro Tempore Jinggoy Estrada said on Sunday. “My stand is, it depends on the majority. And if it will redound to the benefit of the people, why not? But it still depends on the decision of the majority in the Senate,” he said in an interview with radio dzBB. Sen. Joel Villanueva on Friday said at least four or five senators have so far signified their intent to increase the 2025 funding of the OVP. “I’ve spoken to like four or five members who share my view of increasing the budget of the OVP from that in the GAB passed by Congress,” he said. Estrada clarified that he was not among the lawmakers Villanueva was referring to. “Senator Joel hasn’t spoken to me about it yet. I was not part of the conversation about whether or not the OVP funding will be increased,” Estrada said. <h2>Not enough</h2> Asked if he himself would agree to increase the OVP budget, he reiterated that it would depend on the majority in the Senate. “If it’s necessary that we give [an increase], then give it. If not, then don’t,” Estrada said. It will be known during the budget approval this week whether the Senate would increase the OVP budget or if it would just adopt the P733-million budget approved by the House of Representatives. Villanueva, in an interview with reporters on Friday, said he has been vocal about his stance on the P1.29-billion cut in the OVP’s funding made by the House. “As I mentioned earlier, I’m also in that position to somehow increase the budget, not necessarily restore everything... I don’t look at personalities; I don’t look at whatever some politicians are looking at right now; I’m just after the office itself. The Office of the Vice President deserves more,” he pointed out. “We have yet to discuss the exact amount. [But], for me, at least P100 (million), P150 (million) is decent enough to increase the budget. So, we’ll see. On our end, we listen to both camps and the positions of our colleagues. And whatever the consensus is, I will respect the decision of the whole Senate,” he added. <h2>Mixed sentiments</h2> Villanueva also said he could not see a justified reason for the OVP’s fund to be slashed in half. During the Senate plenary deliberations on the OVP’s proposed 2025 budget, senators approved its P733 million outlay, adopting the House version that slashed the original P2.03 billion proposal. However, Vice President Sara Duterte had secured a promise from her allies in the chamber, Senators Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa and Christopher “Bong” Go, to either give additional funding to the OVP or restore its massive budget cuts during the period of amendments. Sen. Grace Poe, the Senate finance committee chair and principal sponsor of the budget said the P733 million earmarked for the OVP was not yet final as senators may still propose to either increase or decrease it, subject to the body’s approval.",

It is an attempt by the group to convince the Senate to convene as an impeachment court and immediately start the impeachment trial of Duterte.

It aims to “produce competent, job-ready, active, responsible and patriotic citizens.” In a memorandum signed on Dec. 20, 2023, by Education Undersecretaries Gina Gonong and Wilfredo Cabral, it said the series of trainings would ensure that teachers and school leaders have an in-depth understanding of the revised curriculum for kindergarten, Grades 1, 4 and 7. “Specifically, it aims to equip teachers and school leaders with the necessary knowledge, skills, and competencies to effectively implement the new curriculum in the coming school year,” the officials added. According to the memorandum, lead trainers, including directors of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines, chiefs and training specialists will undergo the preparation work first from Jan. 22 to Jan. 26. <h2>Maximize teachers’ load</h2> In the next weeks, the training will be implemented at the national, regional and division levels with teachers from kindergarten, Grades 1, 4, and 7 starting a one-month school-based training on the new curriculum on March 4. But even before that, a quality assurance and finalization of the curriculum training resource package will be done from Jan. 8 to 19, DepEd said. To ensure that all teachers concerned would be able to attend the training, school heads were advised to implement strategies like maximizing the load of those from other grade levels who would not be participating. They may also schedule a half-day training for Kindergarten, Grades 1, 4, and 7 teachers totaling 40 hours to avoid disrupting regular classes. For those who could afford it, school heads may consider hiring substitute teachers, or tapping teacher applicants for voluntary service during the training period.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo Loyzaga flagged the increasing extraction of deep-sea minerals during a side event at the ongoing global climate talks in Dubai, as she cited the need to further study and establish governing policies and rules on the issue. “We wish to note with concern the lack of knowledge we have of these environments and the consequence of their physical, chemical, and biological disruption,” Loyzaga said during the forum titled “No Paris without the Ocean: Partnerships to Activate Ocean-Climate Solutions at Scale.” Loyzaga, head of the Philippine delegation to the 28th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change or COP28, stressed the need to safeguard and restore the “blue carbon ecosystem,” specifically dealing with deep-sea economic activities like mineral extraction. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature, deep-sea mining refers to the process of retrieving mineral deposits from the ocean below 200 meters. There is currently little data that could help in understanding the ecological relationships and impacts associated with deep-sea mining, based on a 2022 policy brief by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative (UNEP FI). Despite this, it said that “current scientific consensus suggests that deep-sea mining will be highly damaging to ocean ecosystems.” <h2>‘Risk to the ocean’</h2> While there are many existing ocean-linked sectors that could potentially contribute to the “sustainable blue economy,” the UNEP FI said this was not true for all sectors. “The extraction of nonrenewable marine resources such as oil and gas and seabed mineral deposits in particular poses a significant risk to the ocean and cannot be considered sustainable,” it said. Loyzaga, for her part, emphasized that countries need to look beyond their national jurisdiction in the high seas to safeguard and protect the integrity of marine ecosystems. She likewise cited the need to align efforts with the goals stipulated in the Paris Agreement and the High Seas Treaty, or the Agreement on Marine Biodiversity of Areas Beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ). The landmark BBNJ document was agreed upon in June after almost two decades of negotiations. It is the first-ever treaty intended to protect the world’s high seas, or the ocean area beyond the countries’ exclusive economic zones. As of September, nearly 70 countries, including the Philippines, have ratified the treaty during the UN General Assembly.",

The Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said it would begin deploying 70,000 enumerators beginning on Monday to conduct a population census. In Proclamation 627 dated July 9, Mr. Marcos urged the public to cooperate with the PSA and “provide truthful and complete information in response to census questions, subject to existing laws, rules and regulations.” He stressed the importance of the census as it “equips government executives, policymakers and planners with current and comprehensive population data to develop informed social and economic development plans, policies and programs.” The President earlier called for a census update on the list of beneficiaries in the government’s social protection programs. <strong>READ: <a class=\"sc-cBIjbw bLUVIX\" href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1457031/filipinos-now-total-109-million\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Growing, growing, growing!

The figure was higher by 8.05 million compared with 2015’s population of 100.98 million. Executive Order No. 352, issued in 1996, mandated the conduct of nationwide censuses and surveys every five years and the maintenance of administrative-based records regularly. Proclamation No. 627, on the other hand, tasked the National Economic and Development Authority and PSA to lead, coordinate, and supervise activities concerning the observance of the National Census and Community-Based Monitoring System Month. &nbsp;",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Two groups called for a phaseout of tobacco products, including cigarettes and electronic smoking devices (ESDs), emphasizing their impact on the environment, besides public health. In a joint press release on Sunday, a day before World Health Day, toxics watchdog EcoWaste Coalition and Action on Smoking and Health-Philippines (ASH Philippines) pointed out the difficulty in collecting and recycling the waste left behind by tobacco products. “The only solution to tobacco and related product waste is upstream, meaning keep them from being produced, marketed, and used in the first place,” said ASH Philippines executive director Dr. Maricar Limpin. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://opinion.inquirer.net/181184/the-long-fight-against-tobacco-epidemic\">The long fight against tobacco epidemic</a></strong> According to EcoWaste and ASH Philippines, there is “no reasonable method” that can be used to collect waste products such as discarded cigarette butts and ESDs. ESDs include e-cigarettes, vapes, or other similar electronic devices that may contain tobacco, nicotine, e-liquids, or derivatives of cannabis. “More importantly, they are full of carcinogens and toxins. Any product they are made into will also be full of carcinogens and toxins, not to mention the danger to those working in recycling facilities,” the groups added. ASH Philippines and EcoWaste Coalition called on smokers and vapers to quit and for nonsmokers not to start smoking. <h2>DOH denies donations</h2> Meanwhile, the DOH has maintained it did not receive any donations from antihealth industries. “The DOH continues to refuse and reject all proposed donations by the tobacco industry, whether to its officials or the agency or its units,” the health agency said in a statement over the weekend. “We are saddened that some may have fallen victim to industry tactics of divide and conquer,” it added. Health advocacy groups earlier slammed Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa and called for his resignation for posing for a photo with executives from a tobacco company. They pointed out that his presence in ceremonies for the donation of four mobile clinics donated by Philip Morris Fortune Tobacco Corp. Inc. and the Lucio Tan Group Inc. to the Department of Social Welfare and Development in Malacañang on March 20 was illegal and unethical. <h6>—WITH A REPORT FROM DEXTER CABALZA</h6>",

STORY: Coast Guard to have 24,500 men by end of 2022\" width=\"620\" height=\"349\" /> MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is expected to have 24,500 personnel by year-end when new recruits complete their training, PCG commandant Adm. Artemio Abu said during the agency’s 121st anniversary on Wednesday. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. served as the guest of honor at the event held at Port Area in Manila, where he acknowledged the agency’s role in being on the front line in defending the country’s maritime territory and other law enforcement duties. The PCG only had 8,500 members in 2016, but it conducted its biggest single enlistment in September and recruited 1,500 draftees. The enlistment boosts the agency’s aim to have 35,000 personnel to have enough manpower in addressing maritime challenges and increasing assets. The PCG has expanded its presence through 15 PCG regional districts, 89 stations, and more than 400 substations nationwide, Abu said. He also cited the PCG’s recent efforts and accomplishments in maritime security, search and rescue, law enforcement, and environmental protection. Part of it includes increased patrols in the West Philippine Sea and the installation of sovereign markers or buoys near four islands and reefs in the Kalayaan Islands in May. The PCG ships have also faced China Coast Guard ships head-on in accompanying Philippine supply ships in Ayungin Shoal. “The President has guaranteed that not a square inch of Philippine territory will be abandoned to another nation. Rest assured that the Philippine Coast Guard is committed to the country’s position in ensuring territorial integrity,” Abu said. <strong>RELATED STORIES</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1681988/bongbong-marcos-backs-pcgs-modernization-efforts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos backs PCG’s modernization efforts</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1574256/pcg-reports-ccg-close-distance-mauevering-in-bajo-de-masinloc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PCG reports China Coast Guard’s ‘close distance maneuvering’ anew in Bajo de Masinloc</a></strong> <strong><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1651658/ph-coast-guard-gets-p11-million-equipment-donation-from-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PH Coast Guard gets P11 million equipment donation from US</a></strong>",

The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has approved a budget of P113.75 billion for SUCs in the 2025 National Expenditure Program (NEP), down from last year’s P128.13 billion. Under the 2025 NEP, P65.17 billion will go to personnel services, P39 billion for maintenance and other operating expenses, and P9.54 billion for capital outlay. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1836579/huge-cut-in-budget-of-state-universities-colleges-hit/#ixzz8m6err58H\">Huge cut in budget of state universities, colleges hit</a></strong> The P14.38 billion was taken from the budget for capital outlay, which, according to the SUC officials, cover facilities, equipment, and “other investments” that would serve them for periods beyond 2025. <h2>Appeal to lawmakers</h2> In a unity statement, they called on Congress to restore the slashed budget and to augment the higher education funding for next year. “Additional budget is needed for our learning institutions to regain their public character and provide ample support for student services and faculty development. If our SUCs are expected to carry out their duties as higher education institutions, they must be funded accordingly,” the officials said. Among those who signed the statement were presidents of the University of the Philippines System, Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Mindanao State University System, Philippine Normal University, Don Mariano Marcos Memorial State University, University of Southeastern Philippines, University of Northern Philippines, University of Rizal System, Cavite State University, Bicol University and Zamboanga State College of Marine Sciences and Technology. <h2>Education crisis</h2> They lamented the crisis in the country’s higher education system, saying, “Going through the world’s worst and longest school closure has had lasting impacts on the educational community and has presented challenges for administrators, teachers, staff and students alike.” “Academic spaces have been shrinking and becoming less conducive, and the services that enable a student to learn unhampered leave more to be desired,” they added. According to them, it was important now more than ever for the government to “recognize, respect, and uphold the Filipino people’s right to education.”",

Romel Lopez, spokesperson for the DSWD, said the cash assistance would be distributed through the agency’s Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP), the same source of funding for the financial aid given to rice retailers. Under the cash assistance program of the government, a retailer can receive P15,000 as financial aid to cope with the <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/?top-story=rice-price-cap-may-be-lifted-after-harvest-marcos-hints\">rice price cap</a> set by President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. earlier this month to arrest the skyrocketing prices of rice. The government has already started the distribution of cash assistance days after the price cap took effect, beginning with rice retailers. This time, the DSWD, which was tasked with distributing the financial assistance, will be making the payouts to qualified variety store owners this week. Lopez explained that the DSWD would prioritize its payout on sari-sari store owners who sell rice within the price cap of P41 per kilo for regular-milled rice and P45 for well-milled rice. The store owners must also have their businesses registered with the Business Permit and Licensing Office of their local governments. The store must also have a barangay registration and participate in the nano-retailer program “which is supported financially by their [local government] in order to qualify for the program and be eligible to receive the cash aid,” Lopez explained.",

As if turning the tables on Tulfo, CA members quizzed the former broadcaster and tabloid columnist about his personal life and previous careers before joining the Marcos administration. The DSWD secretary-designate is one of the four Tulfo brothers in the broadcast industry, whose brand of brash journalism has earned them huge followings on social media. His younger brother, Raffy Tulfo, was elected senator in May. Speaking with reporters after the three-hour proceedings, Tulfo admitted he became an American citizen in 1988. He regained his Filipino citizenship only this year as part of the requirements for his appointment as a public official. He added that he had anticipated the matter to be raised at the hearing. “That’s why I brought the documents with me. I came prepared,” he said. “The decision [regarding my confirmation] will be in their hands.” The issue was raised by Caloocan City Rep. Oscar Malapitan, who disclosed that Tulfo was a member of the US military from 1988 to 1992 as stated in the report given to CA members. <h2>Joined US military</h2> Sagip Rep. Rodante Marcoleta said Tulfo’s records also revealed he was in “active military service stationed in Europe” from 1992 to 1996. “Did you renounce your Filipino citizenship?” Malapitan asked Tulfo. Instead of directly answering the question, Tulfo moved for a closed-door session with the CA members, who swiftly granted his request. After an hourlong executive session, Bacolod City Rep. Greg Gasataya, who presided over the proceedings, adjourned the hearing and deferred Tulfo’s confirmation as the CA discussed his predicament. Tulfo later clarified that he had applied for American citizenship not because of his decision to join the US military. “I cannot divulge that. I’m sorry,” he told reporters. But Marcoleta pointed out that only individuals who had secured their American citizenship either by birth or naturalization may serve in the US forces. He also noted that Tulfo was previously found guilty of libel, an offense deemed as a crime involving turpitude. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1696326/erwin-tulfos-libel-conviction-raised-in-ca-debates-on-his-appointment-as-dswd-chief\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erwin Tulfo’s libel conviction raised amid DSWD appointment debate</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1653999/no-tulfo-apology-aide-says-he-was-taken-out-of-context\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">No Erwin Tulfo apology; aide says he was taken ‘out of context’</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1664908/erwin-tulfo-dswd-budget-for-aid-now-stands-at-less-than-p1-billion\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Erwin Tulfo: DSWD aid budget is less than P1 billion and running low</a></h2>",

The DA said that there are about 10 million farmers and fisherfolk, but initially, only 1.4 million of them were listed before the update began. Navarro added that the update will also classify between those that will be assisted by the DA, and those that will be referred to other government agencies. “This will allow us to cleanse the list for better use of our resources,” he added. </div>",

Francis Escudero on Saturday called on the government to refrain from imposing more taxes that will deal a heavy blow to poor Filipinos, and instead be open to collecting more taxes from the wealthy. Escudero made the suggestion as he criticized Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno who dismissed proposals to impose taxes on luxury goods and services. “I am not in favor of any tax, but if there is any type of tax that we need to impose, it should start with discussions on it and not for [officials] to immediately reject the proposal and resort to tax alternatives that will burden more of our people, including the poor,” he said. He was referring to Diokno’s pronouncements at a House hearing that rejected plans to impose tax on luxury goods. “They [at the <a href=\"https://www.dof.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Finance</a>] are saying [tax on luxury goods] is difficult to implement because owners such as diamonds can just hide the luxury items.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Neophyte House lawmakers on Monday advised Vice President Sara Duterte to attend both the congressional inquiry into her alleged misuse of public funds and the National Bureau of Investigation’s probe of her supposed kill threat against President Marcos. At a press conference on Monday, 1-Rider party list Rep. Ramon Rodrigo Gutierrez stressed that both the inquiry by the House committee on good government and public accountability and the NBI investigation were legal processes requiring compliance. The NBI earlier required Duterte to appear before it on Nov. 29 to explain her “active threat” to have Marcos, his wife Liza and Speaker Martin Romualdez assassinated should she be killed. But this was moved by the NBI to Dec. 11 after she asked for it to be rescheduled, saying she wanted to attend the House hearing set on Nov. 29. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2010863/despite-scrapped-house-hearing-vp-duterte-still-no-show-at-nbi#ixzz8tHFoAbGK\">Despite scrapped House hearing, VP Duterte still no-show at NBI</a></strong> However, the House panel, which is looking into allegations that over P600 million in funds given to the Office of the Vice President and Department of Education were misused from 2022 to 2023, called off its hearing to avoid any conflict with Duterte’s NBI appearance. “I don’t understand why it would be easier to commit to one and not the other,” Gutierrez said. He was referring to Duterte’s statement that she would choose appearing before the House panel chaired by Manila Rep. Joel Chua over abiding by the NBI summons. <h2>Legal processes</h2> “I think she should commit to both because these are both legal processes that have to be complied with ... I hope that’s what she does,” Gutierrez said. Assistant Majority Leader and Lanao del Sur Rep. Zia Adiong, on the other hand, pointed out that Duterte’s appearance in both proceedings was only “proper and was how an official respects the rule of law.” “It’s not really a matter of choice. I think it’s proper, and it’s how an official respects the rule of law,” Adiong said, adding that the Vice President should deal squarely with the NBI probe. “So it’s not really a choice between which do you favor: the committee hearing or the NBI. Both are important,” he pointed out. For her part, Assistant Majority Leader Amparo Maria Zamora slammed Duterte’s claim that the presidency was already hers in 2022, saying, “Then why didn’t she run if she had it in the bag? I mean, it’s already [almost] 2025, why is she just saying that now?”",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Assistant Minority Leader Arlene Brosas on Tuesday called on the Commission on Audit (COA) to deliver on its commitment to complete its audit of the Office of the Vice President’s (OVP) P125 million in confidential funds in 2022. In a statement, Brosas, a Gabriela party-list representative, reminded the COA of its promise to finish the audit by today (Nov. 15). The agency made that commitment during plenary debates in late September on House Bill No. 8980, or the 2024 General Appropriations Bill. It was during the plenary debates that the COA confirmed the <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1836566/ovp-secret-funds-spent-in-11-not-19-days-quimbo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">OVP spent the P125 million in just 11 days</a>. Through its budget sponsor, Rep. Stella Luz Quimbo, who is senior vice chair of the House Committee on Appropriations, the COA corrected Brosas and other Makabayan bloc lawmakers who had earlier reported that the money, transferred from the Office of the President’s contingent funds, was spent in 19 days. Brosas replied: “It’s hard to comprehend that if that is for surveillance, how many reward payments have been made to spend P11 million per day... Did the OVP submit a liquidation report to the Office of the President, president of the Senate, and speaker of the House?” Quimbo replied that the liquidation report was submitted by the OVP on Jan. 17, 2023, and that the COA was doing an audit of such expenses and had committed to finish its audit of the P125 million by Nov. 15. <h2>Call for transparency</h2> Brosas said: \"We believe that the Filipino people have the right to know how public funds are being utilized, especially when it involves significant amounts such as the OVP's P125-million corruption-prone confidential funds transferred from the Office of the President and spent within just 11 days in 2022.” She stressed that it was also “crucial that the full audit report of all government agencies be made available to the public.” “We need transparency and accountability in the handling of public funds to ensure that they are used for their intended purpose and not for personal gain,\" Brosas added. The lawmaker noted that the issue of confidential and intelligence funds has been rightfully criticized by the public because the funds are not subject to genuine audit and public scrutiny which, she pointed out, created a loophole allowing those handling them to evade accountability. “We urge the government to address this issue and ensure the responsible utilization of public funds. It is crucial that confidential funds undergo the same audit procedures implemented in any other government expenses,” Brosas said. <h2>Realignment</h2> Mounting opposition among lawmakers to the granting of confidential and intelligence funds to civilian agencies eventually led to the realignment of these allocations mainly to agencies involved in protecting the country's interest in the West Philippine Sea, such as the Philippine Coast Guard. The biggest was Vice President Sara Duterte’s proposed budget of <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1857675/sara-gives-up-seeking-p650m-in-secret-funds\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">P650 million in confidential funds for 2024</a> — P500 million for the OVP and P150 million for the Department of Education (DepEd) which she heads as concurrent secretary.",

He said the department’s target was to administer by the end of August all 391,860 Pfizer bivalent vaccine doses received from Lithuania on June 3. “However, it took us until this September to consume all the 390,000 doses,” he said. He added the Philippines had requested around 2 million more bivalent vaccines from the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility. “[At this rate] we may not be able to use them up, especially if they have short shelf lives,” Herbosa said. He added the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines has slowed down worldwide. “Generally even in other countries, people are no longer scared of COVID-19.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Another petition has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking to declare the 2025 General Appropriations Act (GAA) unconstitutional for allegedly circumventing the constitutional directive to allocate the biggest budget to education. The Teachers’ Dignity Coalition, Freedom from Debt Coalition, and the Philippine Alliance of Human Rights Advocates submitted a petition for certiorari and prohibition on Monday, asking the high tribunal to strike down the 2025 GAA, or Republic Act No. 12116, for violating Section 5(5), Article XIV of the Constitution. It mandates that “the State shall assign the highest budgetary priority to education and ensure that teaching will attract and retain its rightful share of the best available talents through adequate remuneration and other means of job satisfaction and fulfillment.” <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://opinion.inquirer.net/179773/curing-the-2025-national-budget\">Curing the 2025 national budget</a></strong> They also urged the high court to issue a temporary restraining order and a writ of prohibition, directing the President to desist from implementing the 2025 national budget and prohibiting the respondents from disbursing public funds for its enforcement and implementation. Named respondents in the case, docketed as G.R. No. 279199, are President Marcos, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, the Senate, and the House of Representatives. <h2>P1.05-T allocation</h2> Under this year’s national budget of P6.326 trillion, the education sector is receiving the highest allocation at P1.05 trillion. However, the petitioners argued that the education sector’s budget was only significantly increased by aggregating nontraditional education-related funds from various agencies and offices. These included funding for the Philippine Military Academy, the Philippine National Police Academy, the Philippine Public Safety College under the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Local Government Academy, the National Defense College of the Philippines, and the Philippine Science High School System and the Science Education Institute, both under the Department of Science and Technology. This same argument of “bloating” the education budget was also raised in earlier petitions challenging the 2025 GAA. “The inclusion of noneducation-related spending strays from the functional composition of the education sector, namely the Department of Education, state universities and colleges, the Commission on Higher Education, and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority, which collectively garnered a combined budget of P913 billion, a poor second to infrastructure,” the petitioners argued. They also cited education data from global and national institutions revealing that “education in the country is in crisis.” “Never before has there been a more unjust and callous national budget in this country. The petitioners, thus, urgently implore this honorable Supreme Court to correct this gross injustice,” they said.",

DOH officer in charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said on Thursday the health department had already instructed all hospitals in the country to be on code white, the lowest alert level that directs them to activate manpower and facility resources and form a team solely for firecracker casualties. “All the hospitals have been told to prepare for firecracker injuries,” Vergeire said at a press briefing. “We are now in code white, meaning all are instructed to prepare, all are instructed to have a special team to address the concerns of people who are going to our hospitals with injuries due to firecrackers.” https://youtu.be/iq5ow0dTYTU <h2></h2> <h2>Preparedness urged</h2> &nbsp; Under the code white status, medical personnel are placed on an “on-call status for immediate mobilization” to ensure the readiness of the hospital to respond to emergencies, whether injuries or poisoning incidents due to firecrackers. Based on the latest DOH data, 36 firecracker-related injuries were reported from Dec. 21 to Dec. 29, an increase of 44 percent from the same period last year. Of the latest count, four new cases were recorded on Thursday. The prohibited “boga,” an improvised cannon made with polyvinyl chloride pipes, is the top culprit of injuries, with 14 cases, or 39 percent, of total cases. This was followed by whistle bombs (four cases); five star and “kwitis,” a permissible rocket fireworks, (three each); and “camara” (one). No ingestion of fireworks or stray bullet injuries were reported. Vergeire and other health officials made hospital rounds in Metro Manila on Thursday to inspect the emergency response of hospitals ahead of the New Year’s Eve celebrations. At a press briefing, Vergeire attributed the slight increase in reported firecracker injuries this year to the more relaxed mobility restrictions, as well as the enhanced surveillance of the DOH of other diseases and health emergencies.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Valenzuela City is the latest local government shutting its doors on Philippine offshore gaming operators (Pogos), whose contributions to the economy tend to be overshadowed by their increasing association with crime, particularly human trafficking involving Chinese nationals. Speaking to reporters on Tuesday, Mayor Wes Gatchalian said the city council had passed three ordinances prohibiting all forms of gambling in the city, including Pogos. He thus ordered the suspension of new applications also for the operation of Small Town Lottery (STL), online cockfighting, online bingo, and online poker, among others. Valenzuela City remains without any Pogo establishment but currently has nine STL operators, he noted. <h2>‘Moral, social impacts’</h2> The mayor said he signed the ordinances to preempt any of the “social impacts’’ arising from the proliferation of illegal gambling, such as human trafficking, money laundering, prostitution, and kidnapping. He recalled that during a raid on an unauthorized cockfight or “tupada” in Barangay Lingunan in May 2021, a teenager was shot dead by the police during the commotion. “In my view, Philippine resources end up being used to deal with complaints arising from Pogos,” the mayor said. While there may be “economic benefits” from hosting such companies, he said, they have also proven to have “moral and social impacts” that the city government now wants to prevent. “That’s why I’m making this preemptive move before they reach Valenzuela,’’ Gatchalian added. The recently passed ordinances penalize violators with fines ranging from P100,000 up to P500,000, according to Councilor Ricar Enriquez, the majority floor leader. <h2>Pasig initiative</h2> A ban on Pogos and other forms of online gambling took effect also in Pasig City in December last year. In signing Ordinance No. 55, series of 2022, Pasig City Mayor Vico Sotto gave companies running e-games, “e-sabong,” e-bingo, online poker and casinos, and computer gaming stations one year to wrap up their operations and leave the city. In September 2022, following reports on a spate of serious crimes, including killings and abductions, the Senate moved to ban Pogos nationwide. That same month, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said illegal Pogo workers would be summarily deported.

      "article_body": "MAMNILA, Philippines — Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Wednesday questioned the Ombudsman’s procedures in ordering him and several officials to respond to criminal and administrative complaints over the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte, while also casting doubt on the filing made by the Senate committee on foreign relations. “It seems the procedure isn’t clear because, before, there was a fact-finding process and rules that were published. This time, it’s like there was no fact-finding at all, it went straight to us,” Remulla told reporters in an interview at the Department of Justice (DOJ). Despite these concerns, he said he would comply with the directive and submit his counteraffidavit. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/2058817/ombudsman-orders-remullas-3-more-respond-to-duterte-arrest-complaint\">Ombudsman orders Remullas, 3 more: Respond to Duterte arrest complaint</a></strong> In two separate orders issued by the Office of the Ombudsman on Tuesday, Remulla and his brother, Interior Secretary Jonvic Remulla, along with Philippine National Police chief Gen. Rommel Marbil, PNP Criminal Investigation and Detection Group chief Nicolas Torre III, and Special Envoy for Transnational Crimes Markus Lacanilao, were ordered to submit their counteraffidavits within 10 days, along with their witnesses’ affidavits. This is after the Senate committee on foreign relations headed by Sen. Imee Marcos, filed a complaint against them over the March 11 arrest of Duterte and his turnover to the custody of the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague. <h2>‘Not even a committee report’</h2> Echoing the DOJ’s reply to the petitions filed with the Supreme Court over the former president’s arrest, Remulla said the government did not violate the law when it helped in the arrest of Duterte and his handover to The Hague to face charges of crimes against humanity for his bloody war on drugs. “We will respond to every issue, that everything that happened was within legal bounds, all of it was according to the law,” Remulla said. The DOJ chief also questioned the complaint, as he criticized the timing of the filing. “It’s actually the complaint itself. I found it a bit strange; it’s not even a committee report. Why the haste? Why not wait for the committee report, since that’s [the result of] the committee’s investigation? What was contained was the chairman’s report; that’s a little strange,” Remulla said. “Once the election is over, that should be the end of it, because it seems like [the investigation] was just in aid of getting publicity for the elections,” he added. /cb/abc",

Pascual revealed the amount in a meeting with the President and presidential adviser on investment and economic affairs Frederick Go, who is also president and chief executive officer of developer Robinsons Land. During the meeting, Pascual said a total of 116 projects, worth $62.926 billion or P3.48 trillion, were generated from his foreign trips. According to Pascual, the Philippine government reaped $8.48 billion (P468.96 billion) in Indonesia, $6.54 billion (P361.67 billion) in Singapore, $3.847 billion (P212.74 billion) in the United States, $4.62 billion (P255.53 billion) in Thailand, $2.20 billion (P121.68 billion) in Belgium, $24.239 billion (P1.34 trillion) in China and <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1728862/marcos-back-from-japan-we-carry-with-us-over-13-billion-in-pledges\">$13 billion (P719 billion) in Japan.</a> <h2>Details of MOUs, LOIs</h2> In a video message released by the Presidential Communications Office, the President said “we are starting to go into the details” of all the memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and letters of intent (LOIs) signed during his official trips abroad. The Palace press office released the video as the President’s detractors criticized his foreign trips after he spent a weekend in Singapore in October and attended the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, last month. The President has made nine official trips, excluding the weekend in Singapore, since he assumed office in June. Three of the trips were state visits (Indonesia, Singapore and China) while the rest were working visits that coincided with multilateral meetings, like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, that any president would be obliged to attend. “I can already report that some of the MOUs that we signed in Indonesia and in Singapore already have results. And in fact, I think in the next couple of weeks, we will be starting to inaugurate some of these projects already,” the President said. <h2>P1.5T projects confirmed</h2> Out of the P3.48 trillion, the Palace said $4.349 billion or P239 billion have materialized with the companies already in the various stages of implementation of their projects in the country. The Palace added that projects worth $29.712B, or P1.7 trillion, have existing MOUs or LOIs while confirmed projects worth $28.863, or P1.5 trillion, were already in the planning stage. “And the next item is going to be, we will have to converge all of the different agencies of government so that we are working off the same plan. That is what we will do because we have to strike while the iron is hot,” Mr. Marcos said. He pointed out that there were many things that should be resolved, particularly rules and regulations that “are not investor-friendly” but he did not identify these regulations. “We’re moving very quickly to, as I say, make sure that while the Philippines is still top of mind of these investors that we immediately explore those opportunities and take advantage of the contacts that we made during these trips,” he said. <h6><em>g/</em></h6>",

The mass was held at the San Miguel Parish Church inside the Malacañang compound and was celebrated by Manila Archbishop Jose Cardinal Advincula and attended by several high-ranking officials of the Cabinet. In his homily, Advincula called on the two top leaders to emulate the two traits of the Good Shepherd, such as the “listening leadership and life-giving leadership.” “As we meet in our offices and conference halls asking questions in our heads, may we be mindful of our people who ask questions on their empty stomachs,” he said. “May we be leaders who listen to our people, especially the poor and marginalized,” he added. Further, Advincula offered prayers for the two leaders to “spend yourselves in the service of the common good” while being “guided by truth.” The prelate likewise urged the public to pray and rally behind the country’s leaders. “Mga kababayan, sa diwa ng bayanihan, sama-sama nating mahalin at paglingkuran ang ating bayan. Ipagdasal natin ang ating mga lider; tangkilikin natin ang kanilang mga mahuhusay at mabubuting hangarin at hakbangin,” he said. (My countrymen, in the spirit of Bayanihan, let us all love and serve our country. Let us pray for our leaders and rally behind their good intentions and plans.) “Kailangan nila ang panalangin at pagkikipag-tulungan natin upang magbunga ang mga pagpupunyagi nila para sa ikabubuti nating lahat,” he added. (They need our prayers and cooperation so that their victory will bear fruits that are good for us all.) Other government officials who attended the Holy Mass include Executive Secretary Vic Rodriguez, Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo, Social Welfare and Development Secretary Erwin Tulfo, Justice Secretary Jesus “Boying” Crispin Remulla, and Presidential Management Staff Chief Naida Angping.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas (Pamalakaya) on Friday urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to stop importing fish and instead support agriculture and the fisheries industry. Marcos sits as secretary of the Department of Agriculture in a concurrent position. Ronnel Arambulo, Pamalakaya's spokesperson, suggested that Marcos strengthen local production to make the country's food self-sufficient. \"We expect that the new agriculture secretary will totally abandon the burdening import-liberalization schemes. Instead, he should pivot agricultural policies towards strengthening local production through sufficient government assistance to our fishers and farmers, especially in critical times,\" Arambulo said in a statement. Together with other measures to ensure food abundance, Marcos must fix natural disaster-related problems and restore displaced residents' livelihoods. A major impediment to the growth of the local fishing industry mentioned by Pamalakaya is the large-scale Chinese fishing activity in the West Philippine Sea (WPS) which, by intimidating Filipino fishermen, has led to them abandoning their traditional fishing grounds. Among Pamalakaya's demands are the following: <ul> <li>Economic assistance in times of natural calamities especially typhoons and other ecological disturbances such as fish kill and red tide;</li> <li>Sufficient production subsidy amid soaring prices of oil products and other prime commodities;</li> <li>Ensuring that Filipino fishers can make use of marine resources within the territorial and traditional fishing grounds; and,</li> <li>Prohibition of all types of conversion and reclamation of coastal communities and fishing grounds that displace fishers and destroy marine and aquatic resources.</li> </ul> These policies can boost the productivity of local fishermen, and at the same time help the country to become food self-reliant, according to Pamalakaya. \"These are all doable measures to ensure that we will not fall short on fisheries production and that our country can be food self-reliant. All it takes is the new administration's political will to strengthen our agriculture and fisheries industries by putting an end to liberalization policies that open our floodgates to imported and cheap products to the detriment of our local food producers,\" Arambulo said. Pamalakaya earlier called out Marcos to address China's blockade of traditional fishing grounds in WPS which is part of the Philippine exclusive economic zone, saying that they can no longer bear another six years of \"defeatist collaboration.\" – <em><strong>Nicole Faye Agcaoili, INQUIRER.net intern</strong></em> <strong>RELATED STORY:</strong> <strong><a href=\"https://globalnation.inquirer.net/204962/bongbong-marcos-urged-do-something-to-secure-fishing-rights-in-panatag-shoal\" target=\"_top\" rel=\"noopener\">Bongbong Marcos urged: 'Do something' to secure fishing rights in Panatag Shoal </a></strong> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <h6>EDV/abc</h6>",

(PhilHealth)—lately the subject of controversy over the transfer of P60 billion in its unused subsidies to the national treasury—has increased its benefit package for severe dengue from P16,000 to P47,000. The almost 200 percent increase, which took effect on Nov. 1 is in line with the state health insurer’s aim to provide adequate financial risk protection to Filipinos diagnosed with the disease that continues to be a public health risk nationwide. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://cebudailynews.inquirer.net/600771/philhealth-increases-dialysis-coverage-to-almost-p1-million-per-year#ixzz8rOrOjBFU\">PhilHealth increases dialysis coverage to almost P1 million per year</a></strong> “PhilHealth is committed to supporting Filipinos, most especially during these challenging times,” PhilHealth president and chief executive officer Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday. <h2>Third highest claims</h2> “With this twofold increase in health insurance coverage for severe dengue, we hope to alleviate the financial burden on affected families. There is no more reason to delay seeking immediate medical treatment upon observing dengue symptoms,” he added. In February, PhilHealth raised its benefit package for “dengue with or without warning signs” from P10,000 to P13,000—a 30-percent increase for inflation adjustment. Last year, it paid P1.53 billion to cover a total of 163,209 claims for the mosquito-borne disease, the third highest number of claims among its members, after pneumonia and acute gastroenteritis. From January to October this year, the Department of Health (DOH) reported a total of 314,785 dengue cases, more than double than the 155,823 cases reported in the same period in 2023. Dengue cases peak during the rainy season, which lasts from June to November. According to the DOH, frequent rains increase the breeding grounds for mosquitoes due to the accumulation of stagnant water in some regions, particularly in the National Capital Region, Central Luzon and Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal and Quezon provinces). “The DOH assures the public that hospitals are well-prepared to manage cases effectively. This is in addition to the conduct of hospital orientations on Dengue Clinical Practice Guidelines to ensure hospitals and staff are well-equipped,” it said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/actph1982\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Alliance of Concerned Teachers</a> (ACT) on Sunday maintained that the move of the Department of Education (DepEd) to ask for a list of those affiliated with their group was a violation of their right to freedom of association and privacy after the agency justified its request. In a memorandum dated June 14, Education Undersecretary Revsee Escobedo instructed regional directors and schools division superintendents to submit a complete list of teachers affiliated with ACT who are availing DepEd’s automatic payroll deduction system (APDS). Aside from ACT, DepEd also asked in separate memorandums lists of those affiliated with the Teachers’ Dignity Coalition and DepEd Teachers’ Union. All documents did not indicate or explain the purpose of the request and DepEd only issued a clarificatory statement on Saturday after the memorandum, which ACT suspected as “profiling operations” of the agency, drew criticisms online. “The sole purpose of consolidating the list of [those availing] APDS from various organizations in the regions is to centralize, connect, update and improve the department’s Human Resource Systems, including the APDS,” the DepEd statement read. <h2>No need for list</h2> DepEd added that there have been “regular complaints” from employees over inaccurate, questionable, and unwarranted salary deductions for loan remittances and membership dues. But according to ACT, there was no need for DepEd to collect the list of their members “as it is DepEd which approves and implements the APDS every month.” The group added that its accredited regional unions that have APDS regularly update their members’ status every month.The new memorandum, ACT said, was only seeking to “stigmatize ACT’s work, repress its advocacies and restrict civic space from teachers and education workers who are critical of the government.” “As with DepEd’s justification that the memorandum was to address employees’ complaints of wrong deductions of monthly membership dues, this can be simply resolved by fixing their record mechanisms without compromising the privacy and safety of all other employees,” ACT said. The group likewise pointed out that it had all the reasons to sound the alarm for there was no guarantee that the documents being requested would not be used against ACT and its members, “knowing that the current Secretary and Vice President Duterte is [engaging in] relentless and malicious red-tagging of ACT,” it said. “This is opening the big possibility of violating ACT’s and its members’ right to association, freedom of expression, and protection of privacy. We urge DepEd to go after abusive loan sharks and lending institutions instead and spare unions and teachers’ organizations,” the group added. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1792870/deped-defends-memo-listing-unionist-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DepEd defends memo listing unionist teachers</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1793067/act-hits-back-at-deped-stop-justifying-profiling-of-our-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ACT hits back at DepEd: ‘Stop justifying profiling’ of our teachers</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1790961/deped-hit-for-profiling-militant-teachers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">DepEd hit for profiling militant teachers</a></h3>",

And that’s why it has become a priority of this government that we will fight all the poverty. We will put in all the programs so that one day we can say that we are able to give our people, at the very least, the food that they need to survive, the nutrition that they need to survive,” he added. <h2>‘1M food poor’</h2> Present during the program were Vice President Sara Duterte, Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian, Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma, Manila Mayor Honey Lacuna, Asian Development Bank Philippines country director Pavit Ramachandran and World Food Program Philippines country director Brenda Barton. According to the DSWD, the program aims to provide food augmentation to 1 million households classified as “food poor” as defined by the Philippine Statistics Authority. Beneficiaries will receive P3,000 in food credits from July to December. After his speech, Marcos distributed the Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) cards loaded with food credits to 10 of the 50 initial beneficiaries, among them pregnant and breastfeeding mothers. The president said that beneficiaries would get not just “all kinds of food,” but those with nutritional value. Gatchalian earlier said that beneficiaries could use their EBT cards at accredited retailers such as Kadiwa stores, groceries, and small supermarkets. <h3>RELATED STORIES</h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1774391/food-stamps-staving-off-hunger-until-lasting-solution-is-found\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Food stamps: Staving off hunger until lasting solution is found</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1803643/marcos-wants-to-eliminate-hunger-in-ph-by-2028\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Marcos wants to eliminate hunger in PH by 2028</a></h3> <h3><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1768613/sws-hunger-among-pinoy-families-eased-in-q1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SWS: Hunger among Pinoy families eased in Q1</a></h3>",

Based on the latest monitoring of the Department of Health (DOH) on Thursday, the case of the young boy from the Calabarzon (Cavite, Laguna, Batangas, Rizal, and Quezon) region was the first confirmed case of firecracker ingestion this holiday season. <h2>Treatment takes time</h2> “As of the latest update from the receiving hospital, the family cannot be reached. The DOH appeals to the parents and family of the patient to please return to the hospital for proper medical attention,” the DOH said in a statement. Health Assistant Secretary and DOH deputy spokesperson Albert Domingo stressed the urgency of seeking further medical care in such cases. “Treatment of poisoning takes time, depending on the causative agent and the situation of the patient,” Domingo explained. Symptoms of watusi poisoning “may manifest in the next few hours and persist for a few days” after ingestion, he added. Watusi, which contains yellow phosphorus, potassium chlorate, potassium nitrate, and trinitrotoluene, is often confused with candy because of its size and color, the DOH noted. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880826/demand-weak-despite-cheaper-fireworks-firecrackers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Demand weak despite cheaper fireworks, firecrackers</a></strong> <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880576/groups-warn-public-firecrackers-traumatize-pets-bad-for-environment\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Groups warn public: Firecrackers traumatize pets, bad for environment</a></strong> <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1880206/ecowaste-coalition-on-fireworks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ditch toxic fireworks and firecrackers, prioritize health — EcoWaste</a></strong> <h2>First-aid measures</h2> Under Republic Act. No. 7183, which regulates the sale, manufacture, distribution, and use of firecrackers, watusi is described as usually “reddish in color, about 1.5 inches in length and 0.1 inch in width, and usually ignited by friction to produce a dancing movement and a crackling sound.”The DOH advised the public to not induce vomiting if a piece of watusi is swallowed and instead bring the patient immediately to the hospital. Another first-aid measure for children is to make them consume egg whites — from about six to eight raw eggs. For adults, eight to 12 raw eggs may be necessary, it added. <h2>Nationwide monitor</h2> The latest cases tallied by the DOH, logged from 6 a.m. on Dec. 27 to 5:59 a.m. on Dec. 28, raised the total number of firecracker-related injuries nationwide to 88, with about a third of them in Metro Manila. The age of the patients ranges from 5 to 49, with a median of 18 years old. The types of firecrackers so far causing most of the injuries were the “boga,” “5-star,” “kwitis,” “piccolo,” “pla-pla,” “whistle bomb” and “luces.” The majority, or 59 percent, of the injuries were due to the use of firecrackers that are listed as illegal, according to the DOH.",

      "article_body": "A year has passed and rights advocates have yet to see improvements in the country’s human rights situation under President Bongbong Marcos, who has “done little” to address this issue, the New York-based Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Thursday. HRW looked into his efforts to address human rights-related problems since the time of his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose administration is accused of killing thousands in his brutal war on drugs. Mr. Marcos has pledged and guaranteed that human rights would be protected during his term and tried to allay concerns of the international community. This was his promise to several Manila-based diplomats who congratulated him on his victory in last year’s presidential elections. In a statement a day before Mr. Marcos was to mark his first year in office, the group said that the drug war killings continued “though at a lower rate.” Philippine authorities “remain responsible” for the alleged extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances and arbitrary arrests of activists and critics of the government, it said. It also pointed to the “baseless prosecutions” of veteran journalist and Nobel laureate Maria Ressa and former Sen. Leila de Lima, taking note of her continued detention. <h2>‘Rescind the orders’</h2> Citing data from the University of the Philippines’ Third World Studies Center, HRW said there had been 336 “drug-related” killings since Mr. Marcos assumed power, most of which were carried out during police operations. “Marcos has yet to rescind the orders and other policy statements that underpinned Duterte’s ‘war on drugs,’” it said. “He should formally announce an end to the ‘drug war,’ order investigations into officials implicated in illegal killings, and fulfill his promise to use nonviolent means to address illegal drugs,” it added. <h2>‘Break from the past’</h2> The group also suggested that concerned government agencies should provide “adequate and consistent” support to the families of the drug war victims, especially children. HRW also reiterated its call on the President to cooperate with the investigation of charges of crimes against humanity allegedly committed by Duterte by the International Criminal Court. Bryony Lau, HRW’s deputy Asia director, said Mr. Marcos “needs to do more than issue statements” about democracy and following the rule of law to demonstrate his “genuine commitment” to human rights. “Without concrete action to break old patterns of abuses and secure accountability for past crimes, his words have little credibility,” she said. “Marcos needs to demonstrate a break from the past and show concrete, measurable progress on human rights,” she added. <strong>READ: <a class=\"LinkSuggestion__Link-sc-1gewdgc-4 cLBplk\" href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1344447/hrw-doesnt-buy-dutertes-ejk-probe-drug-gangs-killing-each-other-claim-its-baseless\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Duterte’s claim of EJK probe ‘self-serving, without basis’ – Human Rights Watch</a> </strong>",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To help alleviate the burden of soaring domestic fuel prices on fishermen, the <a href=\"https://www.bfar.da.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources</a> (BFAR) is looking at connecting them to oil companies so they can buy petroleum products at discounted prices. “We are exploring the possibility of coming up with a direct sale of diesel for our fisherfolk,” BFAR officer in charge Demosthenes Escoto said. Escoto told reporters that the <a href=\"https://www.doe.gov.ph/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Department of Energy</a> (DOE) was asking for additional details including the list of potential beneficiaries and their respective fuel requirements. <h2>Details, parameters</h2> The BFAR is proposing an industry-to-industry arrangement wherein fishers will be linked to oil companies to enable them to purchase fuel products at lower prices and in bulk. The DOE’s Oil Industry Management Bureau Director Rino Abad confirmed the recent meeting between the two agencies. Abad said the DOE is supportive and willing to help the fishermen at any time but said the BFAR has to provide the necessary details and set the parameters for the planned intervention. “If bulk purchase, there must be a point person and someone will sign a contract. There must be a guarantor. What we’re after is for oil companies to provide them discounts,” Abad told the Inquirer in a phone interview. “We will give them all the data and hopefully they can arrange some sort of an arrangement wherein our fisherfolk can buy fuel at a discounted price. We are trying to pursue it,” Escoto said. The Department of Agriculture is implementing a fuel discount program for farmers and fishers. It was expanded in August this year to include all agricultural commodities. For this year, the agency earmarked P500 billion for this initiative and was later raised to P1.1 billion to provide relief to more agricultural producers. <h2>30% fuel discount</h2> Eligible beneficiaries under the program are entitled to a 30-percent fuel discount, or up to P3,000 per farmer or fisher, upon the purchase of gasoline or diesel from designated or contracted gas stations. With the unabated increase in the prices of petroleum products, many fishers were forced to either abandon their livelihood and find alternative jobs or scale down their fishing activities. About 80 percent of fishers’ earnings go to fuel alone. Because of these, the Pambansang Lakas ng Kilusang Mamamalakaya ng Pilipinas said fish prices might go up in the last three months of 2022 due to a projected decline in local fish supply. <h2>RELATED STORIES</h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1656996/pamalakaya-says-proposed-p489-m-fuel-aid-to-fisherfolk-is-insufficient\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pamalakaya says proposed P489-M fuel aid to fisherfolk is insufficient</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1641337/govt-expands-fuel-subsidies-to-farmers-fishers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gov’t expands fuel subsidies to farmers, fishers</a></h2> <h2><a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1614936/luzon-fishers-groan-as-fuel-prices-surge\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Luzon fishers groan as fuel prices surge</a></h2>",

      "article_body": "MABALACAT CITY, PAMPANGA, Philippines — Citing the growing crisis in energy and global waste generation, the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) has disclosed its plan to adopt waste-to-energy technology as a renewable energy source for the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone. The BCDA said it had identified waste-to-energy technology as a sustainable alternative to landfills, especially amid the continuous increase in waste generated in the country and globally. “The BCDA is committed to adopting smart and green innovations to push for the sustainable development of our properties. Utilizing waste-to-energy technology, in particular, will modernize solid waste management and promote green energy, helping usher Clark’s transition toward a circular economy,” said BCDA president and chief executive officer Joshua Bingcang in a statement. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://business.inquirer.net/500491/bcda-conducting-study-for-waste-to-energy-facility-inside-clark#ixzz8yjjlWLPw\">BCDA conducting study for waste-to-energy facility inside Clark</a></strong> The BCDA said it is currently studying a proposed waste-to-energy facility “in an optimal location in Tarlac,” to boost power supply and serve the requirements of locators and investors in Clark. “With waste-to-energy technology, the BCDA can do its part in reducing greenhouse gas emissions while also addressing the energy requirements of our community,” Bingcang said. According to the agency, its waste-to-energy study would include site selection and technical, environmental, social, legal, financial, and economic analysis for the design, construction, operation, and maintenance of the facility. Once the study is completed, the project will be opened for public bidding under Republic Act No. 11966 or the Public-Private Partnership Code of the Philippines and its implementing rules and regulations. The waste-to-energy project is also in line with the Marcos administration’s thrust to bolster solid waste management initiatives in the country. “It will complement the government’s Kalinisan sa Bagong Pilipinas Program, which calls for investment in programs, projects, and activities on solid waste management and ecological practices,” said the BCDA. According to a 2018 World Bank study, global annual waste generation is projected to jump to 3.4 billion tons by 2050. Carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions from solid waste treatment and disposal, primarily driven by open dumps and landfills without gas collection systems, reached 1.6 billion tons in 2016, and is anticipated to increase to 2.6 billion tons by 2050.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) is working with the University of the Philippines (UP) on a recommendation to trim down to just 25 of the 133 generals in the Philippine National Police. Interior Secretary Juanito Victor “Jonvic” Remulla, who earlier said that reforming the national police force was a priority, stressed on Tuesday the need to address “redundancies” in the PNP’s “top-heavy” hierarchy to make it more efficient. The President, Remulla reported in a press briefing at Malacañang, was “very accepting” of the possible recommendations to be finalized by the DILG within four months. <strong>READ: <a href=\"https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1990763/jonvic-remulla-takes-oath-before-marcos-as-new-dilg-chief#ixzz8pPwXNQLq\">Jonvic Remulla takes oath before Marcos as new DILG chief</a></strong> “We’re working together with the UP College of Public Administration to get complete details on how we can reform the PNP’s very top-heavy structure. I think we have 133 generals and I want to whittle that down to 25 so that the organization is more flat,” Remulla said. “It’s the plan; it’s one of my recommendations to flatten the organization,” he added. Remulla pointed out that there were a lot of police generals without commands or groups to supervise. “We have Area Police Commands that do not have actual personnel under them. So we have many areas that have redundancies that need to be trimmed down. It’s a law that needs to be revisited, so those are the things that we will examine,” Remulla said, referring to Republic Act No. 6975 that created the PNP under the DILG. He noted that under civil service rules, police generals were qualified to be promoted every three years, resulting in many of them ending up without a command to supervise. “We want to change a lot of that, to make it five years so that the rate of promotions is slower,” Remulla said. As for current police generals, they would be allowed to remain in the service until their retirement at 56 years old, he added. The DILG chief, who assumed office two weeks ago, expressed optimism that the proposal would not demoralize key senior police officials. “I don’t think so. They’re also soldiers. They follow orders. It’s recommendatory so far so we’ll see,” Remulla said.",

The number of new reported cases last year was 21 percent higher than in 2021 when 12,339 persons were diagnosed with HIV, or an average of 34 new cases per day. In 2017, an average 30 persons in the country were diagnosed with HIV. The DOH also reported that 4,377 more people were diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) last year, which is higher than the 3,871 new AIDS cases diagnosed in 2021. HIV is a virus that attacks the body’s immune system, making the infected person more vulnerable to other infections. If not treated, HIV can lead to AIDS. While there is currently no effective cure for HIV, it can be controlled through proper medical care. Since the country’s first HIV case was reported in 1984, there have been 109,282 confirmed cases reported in the DOH registry. Sexual contact among males who have sex with males has been the predominant mode of transmission among the total reported cases. Before 2007, the predominant mode of transmission was sexual contact between males and females. Last year, 14,637 new HIV cases said they were infected through sexual contact: 10,006 cases were infected via male-to-male sex; 2,970 cases via sex with male and female partners, and 1,661 cases via male-to-female sex.",

Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa received his bivalent COVID-19 vaccine on Wednesday, thus becoming the first recipient in the National Capital Region. This as Herbosa presided the launch of the bivalent vaccination at the Philippine Heart Center in Quezon City. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. also graced the event. In his speech, Marcos renewed his call for Filipinos who remain unprotected against COVID-19 to get vaccinated . \"Let this occasion serve as a call to every Filipino to continue doing your part, get updated on your COVID-19 vaccination, to prevent the resurgence as a means of honoring those who sacrificed their lives during the pandemic,\" Marcos said. \"I thus appeal to everyone, especially those who have yet to receive their primary series of vaccinations, to get vaccinated against COVID-19. This is not for your own good alone but also for the protection of your families and the general public,\" he added. Blood pressure up Meanwhile, Herbosa said that after the vaccination, his blood pressure went up. \"Talagang due na talaga ko sa healthcare worker, siyempre priority kami and I'm also 65 so andoon ako sa both A1 and A2 category,\" he told reporters. (I'm already due given that I'm a healthworker and we are included in the priority sector. I'm also 65 so I'm included in the A1 and A2 category.) \"Mataas daw BP ko after the injection, 160 eh so pinaupo ako. Huwag daw akong tumayo,\" he added. (My blood pressure went up so they asked me to sit. They told me not to stand up.) The Department of Health (DOH) has said bivalent vaccines provide protection against the original COVID-19 strain, SARS-CoV-2, and Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5. Herbosa earlier said those who would be prioritized in the bivalent vaccination are the elderly and the healthcare personnel. A total of 2,900 bivalent doses were given to the Philippine Heart Center. Around 2,500 employees of the hospital are expected to be vaccinated in three days. These bivalent vaccines were part of the over 390,000 doses donated by Lithuania early this month. Herbosa said negotiations are ongoing to acquire more bivalent vaccines as he admits that the donated ones are not enough. \"Definitely kulang no, we're actually happy na mayroong dumating. If you remember, OIC Usec. [Maria Rosario] Vergeire was saying dadating earlier and then naantala, napunta sa ibang bansa. Tapos buti na lang ang Lithuania binigyan tayo,\" Herbosa said. (Definitely, it's not enough, we're actually happy that they arrived. If you remember, OIC Usec. Vergeire was saying it will come at an earlier time and then it was delayed. It was brought to other countries, then Lithuania donated.) \"The negotiation for the next million doses is continuing and we will acquire the subsequent doses both from COVAX at also 'yung procurement na bibilhin natin para lahat ng elderly at vulnerable ma-cover natin,\" he added. —KG/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Top national security and foreign relations experts underscored the importance of dialogue and diplomacy in resolving disputes and preventing war in the West Philippines Sea (WPS). “I think [President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.] has paved the way for that future trajectory of where we're going. So, he's saying, 'Let's just continue dialoguing, constructive dialogue, and the like, and diplomacy,'” National Security Adviser Clarita Carlos said in a statement. Carlos said, “You don’t choose. Play smart. Define what your goals are as a nation. Play your game well. This is now a new Philippines. A newfound confidence about who we are.” For her part, former Ambassador and former Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Rosario Manalo also said that diplomatic solutions are the way to prevent escalation of the present state of affairs. “The value of diplomacy when it comes to the blue economy is to prevent war. War brings about the end of our existence,” Manalo said. “There are three modes of settling disputes. The first one is called the diplomatic process… the second is through legal action… and the third is through arbitration,” the former ambassador said. Likewise, former Philippine National Police (PNP) General and now Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong lamented that his city has been “impacted indirectly by the ongoing issue of the West Philippine Sea.” “The only way we will be able to resolve the issue is through dialogue, constant dialogues, low-key dialogues. Besides, our only objective there is to allow our fishermen to go to that area and proceed with their livelihood. And second, probably a joint exploration on the oil. There was a study made by the US Geological Survey stating therein that there are about a billion barrels of oil and trillion natural gas in the West Philippine Sea,” Magalong said. Former Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro, for his part, said that it takes a “lot of skilled diplomacy to solve that, but one thing is undeniable - the livelihood of our fisherfolk is primary because this is survival for them.” Teodoro said that “multilateralism basically is really important in the sense that it prevents a stronger country, in theory, from bullying a smaller one. Now, having a bilateral approach would mean the more powerful one will prevail.” “So, the balance will be we continue to develop our capabilities in creating a credible deterrent against expansionism, but we continue to pursue those activities which can redound mutually to the benefit of our interests of both people, particularly economically,” Teodoro said. — DVM, GMA Integrated News",

Any help to alleviate what they are going through and to help them get back on their feet would be greatly appreciated.) “Kasabay pa nito, sa kabila ng pagtaas ng presyo ng mga pagkain at iba pang pangunahing bilihin, nais rin naming ipabatid na higit na mahalaga ang unahin ninyo ang inyong mga sariling pangangailangan at ang kapakanan ng inyong pamilya,” she added. (At the same time, amid the rising price of food and other commodities, it is more important that you prioritize your own needs and the well-being of your family.) The OVP’s proposed P2.037-billion budget for next year is currently under scrutiny by Congress. At the Senate, Senator Risa Hontiveros had pointed out that a huge chunk of the OVP’s P1.909-billion budget for its operations is allotted for the delivery of socio-economic programs such as medical and burial assistance, disaster operations, food bags for certain families, and livelihood assistance. The lawmaker and Duterte had a heated exchange after the former said these programs are “very similar” with the existing programs of other line agencies of the government. Meanwhile, at the House of Representatives, the Committee on Appropriations deferred the deliberation s of the OVP’s 2025 budget amid Duterte’s refusal to answer how her office uses its budget. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Minimum wage earners in CARAGA region are set to receive higher wages starting next month after the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board (RTWPB) approved a P50 daily wage increase in the region. According to the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) affirmed the wage order of the RTWPB, granting a P50 daily wage hike for private sector workers, which will be given in two tranches. The wage hike will increase the daily minimum wage in Caraga from P385 to P415 starting January 2, 2025, and from P415 to P435 upon the effectivity of the second tranche on May 1, 2025. Meanwhile, the RTWPB also approved a P1,000 increase for domestic workers (kasambahays) in the region, bringing their minimum wage to P6,000. “The wage order is expected to directly benefit 65,681 minimum wage earners in the region,” the DOLE said. “About 132,217 full-time wage and salary workers earning above the minimum wage may also indirectly benefit as a result of upward adjustments at the enterprise level arising from the correction of wage distortion,” it said. The DOLE also expects that at least 32,866 domestic workers will benefit from the increase, of which 7,939 were under live-in arrangements. In May, DOLE Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said some regional wage boards would begin the review of wage orders after President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. ordered a study of the minimum wage rates in every region. Laguesma previously said the DOLE is expecting all RTWPBs across the country to finish their review before the end of the year. Caraga region covers the provinces of Agusan del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Surigao del Norte, Surigao del Sur, and Dinagat Island. —LDF, GMA Integrated News",

These teachers have J-1 visas which are granted to foreigners in the work-and-study-based exchange and visitor programs of the United States. Three of them were based in Lahaina, but were not affected by the wildfires, according to the DFA official. Four Filipino-Americans were already confirmed dead by authorities due to the catastrophe. Recently identified was Rodolfo Rocutan , 76 years old, from Ilocos. Other fatalities were Conchita Sagudang and her son Danilo , who were both from Abra; and Alfredo Galinato who was a naturalized US citizen originally from Ilocos.

      "article_body": "The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) on Monday said it issued show cause orders (SCOs) to 51 retail firms for selling basic necessities and prime commodities (BNPCs) priced higher than the previous month. The department said the firms were found to have sold BNPCs over 10% higher than the prices in the preceding month, and with inconsistent price tags, or totally absent tags. The stores were given 48 hours from receipt to submit a written explanation on the matter. This comes as the DTI’s Fair Trade Enforcement Bureau (FTEB) conducted inspections in the price and supply of BNPCs carried by 76 retail firms within Malabon, Pasig, Parañaque and Quezon City. The DTI said 70 firms were found to be compliant with the suggested retail price (SRP) bulletin released in August, reflecting a 92% compliance rate in the National Capital Region (NCR). There were six firms issued a letter of inquiry (LOI) for selling items prices higher than the SRP, with the stores given 72 hours to explain. Four have already submitted a written explanation. “We encourage sellers and manufacturers to comply with the SRP bulletin as such informs and protects consumers from deceptive or unconscionable transactions,” Trade Undersecretary Ruth Castelo said in an emailed statement. Prices of consumer goods grew by 6.9% in September , driven by prices of food and non-alcoholic beverages which climbed by 7.4% during the month. Both the Department of Finance (DOF) and the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) expect inflation to remain high in the remainder of the year, due to the weak peso and the damage caused by Typhoon Karding (international name: Noru). —NB, GMA News",

According to Marisol Abdurahman's report on \"24 Oras,\" authorities discovered meat and fish like lapu-lapu covered with sacks. \"Clear violation of food safety, it does not have Sanitary and Phytosanitary Import Clearances (SPSIC) so it's a clear violation of Food Safety Act,\" said Department of Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel De Mesa. The cold storage facilities were not immediately visible as they were hidden behind fake walls. However, authorities were led to their target by the foul smell of some of the products. \"Hinahanap namin saan naggagaling, hindi naman namin makita kasi sarado siya. E masangsang talaga so nung binuksan nila 'yon, may isang kahon na isda na nabubulok,\" Major Joel Pinawin, Field Station Chief, Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service of Port of Manila. In a separate storage facility, authorities also seized frozen peking duck, which are banned in the country. There were also frozen dim sum and vegetables inside the two-story storage building. \"Bacon, may mga pata ng baboy, dito sa ilalim mga beef ribs. So makikita din natin na basta nalang isinalansan,\" said De Mesa. A total of 10 storage facilities were discovered inside the warehouse. The Bureau of Customs said the frozen goods were imported from Hong Kong and China. The bureau added it would recommend a warrant of seizure of the warehouse. It is still unknown where the other items from the warehouse were brought, which according to the department may be harmful to health. \"Kung hindi natin tiyak tiyak ang kaligtasan hindi natin dapat ito ilabas sa merkado,\" said De Mesa. The owners of the cold storage facilities will face corresponding complaints.

      "article_body": "The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) on Monday marked its 87th founding anniversary in a ceremony held at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City. President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. attended the celebration for the first time as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. He was joined by AFP Chief-of-Staff Bartolome Bacarro, Department of Defense officer-in-charge Jose Faustino Jr., Ilocos Norte 1st District Representative Sandro Marcos, and other government officials and foreign dignitaries. Marcos also led the conferment of awards on military officers, civilians, and organizations who had great contributions to the AFP. During his speech, Bacarro vowed to sustain the government’s gains in the country’s internal and external security including decreasing the communists' terrorist groups’ capability and the modernization of the AFP assets. “International security operations are of prime importance to ensure the safety and security of our citizens against spoilers of peace and lawless elements,” said Bacarro. “On this front, we can confidently state that we have achieved strategic victory and it is inching closer towards victory against terrorism. Our localized peace-building efforts with a multi-stakeholder and whole-of-nation approach also yielded positive results that encouraged enemies of the state to return to the fold of the law and build goodwill with communities,” he said. Bacarro also said the AFP has strengthened its external ties with the Philippines’ partner countries in the ASEAN, the Indo-Pacific Region, and other nations. “We also conducted training, military exchanges, and joint combined exercises. These opportunities allowed us to learn from our international counterparts, have our voice heard on the global stage, and conduct defense diplomacy purposely and rationally,” he said. Further, the military official thanked the President and Vice President Sara Duterte for their trust and support, saying they can count “on the same zeal and commitment from the AFP in ensuring the safety, the integrity and the security” in the country. “Soon, we will unveil a new campaign plan, a plan that will assist in setting the stage for the attainment of genuine unity, synergy, and peace for our country. As we look forward to the dawn of the new year, rest assured that we will remain hard at work operationally and strategically in sustaining our gains made these years,” he said. “We all witnessed the AFP accomplish an inordinate amount of good work, thus this has been an uncommonly good year for the AFP,” he added. — BM, GMA Integrated News",

PTFoMS executive director Paul Gutierrez said Remulla issued Administrative Order (AO) 1 on April 15, approving the agency’s request to form an SIT. “We are very thankful for the swift and immediate action of Secretary Remulla creating SIT Dizon. This again shows that the government is unrelenting in pursuing justice for all victims of heinous crimes, especially the members of the press, regardless of when the crime took place,” Gutierrez said in a press statement. Malolos City Prosecutor Aldrin Evangelista, who handled the 2009 Ampatuan Massacre, will lead the investigating task force. According to the PTFoMS, three suspects surfaced during an investigation conducted by an initial SITG and the Philippine National Police (PNP) in 2019 — Sotero ‘Jun’ Jacolbe, Dante Encarnacion Tabusares, aka, ‘Bong Encarnacion,’ and Junell Jane Andagkit Poten, aka, ‘Junell Gerozaga.’ Jacolbe and Encarnacion, however, were recently allowed to post bail by separate Davao courts. “The creation of the SIT is one of the important measures the PTFoMS has adopted to bolster this case,” Gutierrez said. “We shall be announcing the other measures we have prepared as soon as they are finalized. But our message remains simple and clear: Perpetrators of violent crimes against the media would face the full force of the law. It may take some time but justice would prevail in the end,” he said. A radio commentator of Brigada News, Dizon was fatally shot by motorcycle-riding suspects on the evening of July 10, 2019. Investigation showed he might have been targeted due to his criticism of Encarnacion and the KAPA Ministry that was ordered closed by the government in 2019 for allegedly serving as a front for a financial scam. Encarnacion was the leader of KAPA in North Cotabato at the time. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The continuation of the Department of Transportation's (DOTr) program to provide free rides to commuters and incentivize public utility vehicle (PUV) drivers and operators who participated in the initiative did not receive an allocation in the agency's 2023 budget. During the House Committee on Transportation’s hearing on Thursday, Transportation Undersecretary for Road Transport and Infrastructure Mark Steven Pastor said the DOTr requested P12 billion for the service contracting program for 2023. “However, hindi naisama sa [it was not included in the] National Expenditure Program (NEP),” Pastor said. Under the NEP, the DOTr has a proposed budget of P171.1 billion for next year, up 120.4% from P75.8 billion in 2022. Sought for clarification, Budget Undersecretary for Media Affairs, Community Relations, and Internal Audit Goddes Libiran told GMA News Online that the service contracting program is a non-recurring or one-time expenditure item. “It is not a regular program. Hence, similar to previous years, no funds were allocated for it under the 2023 National Expenditure Program (NEP),” Libiran said. The service contracting or “Libreng Sakay” program of the DOTr and the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) was launched in late 2020 under Republic Act No. 11494 or the Bayanihan to Recover as One Act to help commuters and those in the public transport sector affected by the pandemic. Under the service contracting program, PUV operators and drivers who participated in the government’s free ridership program will receive a one-time payout and weekly payments based on the number of kilometers traveled per week, whether they have passengers or not. The DOTr has since continued the implementation of the program in 2021 and 2022. “We are apealing na mapondohan ang service contracting upang next year ay may pondo po ang Libreng Sakay,” Pastor told the House panel. (We are appealing that the service contracting program be funded so that next year the Libreng Sakay program can continue.) ACT-Teachers party-list Representative France Castro expressed support for DOTr's appeal. “Allow us to note further that the inclusion of the SCP in the FY 2022 General Appropriation Act (GAA) is congress-introduced. Hence, we will defer to the wisdom of our honorable lawmakers the decision on whether or not to allot appropriations for the said program,” Libiran said. “We shall likewise defer to the direction of the Department of Finance (DOF) as to policies concerning the sustainability and continuation of programs related to financial assistance,” the Budget official said. The Department of Budget and Management (DBM) has approved the Special Allotment Release Order (SARO) and the Notice of Cash Allocation (NCA) amounting to P1.4 billion , which will cover the additional funds needed for the extended Libreng Sakay program from September 1 until December 31, 2022. “It is important to note that the SCP (service contracting program) was originally implemented by the DOTr at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to provide assistance to the road transport sector badly hit by the pandemic. This year, it was intended to mitigate the impact of the fuel surge. We expect oil prices to stabilize next year,” Libiran said. Libiran was the former assistant secretary for Communications and Commuter Affairs of the DOTr during the previous administration. —KBK/BM, GMA News",

      "article_body": "The House of Representatives on Monday approved on third and final reading a bill establishing a Virology and Vaccines Institute of the Philippines (VVIP), one of one of the priority measures of the Marcos administration amid the lingering COVID-19 pandemic. This developed after the measure numbered House Bill 6452 gathered 216 yes votes, zero no votes and zero abstention during Monday’s plenary session. House Bill 6452 provides that the VVIP, which will be an attached agency of the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), will serve as as the premier research and development institute in the field of virology, encompassing all kinds of viruses and viral diseases in plants, animals and humans. Likewise, the measure states that the VVIP will also be a venue for scientists, research institutes and other organizations in the Philippines and abroad, to work collaboratively to study viruses of agricultural, industrial, clinical and environmental importance. In addition, the bill states that the VVIP will focus on the following key science and technology applications: The same bill also allows the VVIP to procure specialized materials, equipment, and services to be used in its operation and administration, in the most expeditious manner, as well as adopt the most suitable or appropriate method of procurement that it deems fit based on its identified needs and requirements depending on the existing conditions and requirements that justify the use of a particular alternative modality provided for by the Government Procurement Reform Act and its 2016 Revised Implementing Rules and Regulations. Albay Representative Joey Salceda of Albay, one of the authors of the measure, earlier said he envisions the VVIP as the Philippines’ version of the Serum Institute of India known for manufacturing effective vaccines, among others. “India continues to be one of the world’s largest manufacturers of COVID vaccines even if it did not originate them, because they have a serum institute. Vietnam solved ASF (African Swine Flu) first because their serum institute invented a vaccine early on,” Salceda said. “The vaccine institute is not merely a health institute. The applications for virology are immense and broad. Food security, forest management, and the development of a strong pharmaceutical sector all benefit from a strong grasp of viruses,” he added. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

According to him, the Navy increased the number in light of recent developments including the Comprehensive Archipelagic Defense Concept of the Department of National Defense. The Senate Special Committee on Philippine Maritime and Admiralty Zones, headed by Senator Francis Tolentino, discussed the matter further with concerned officials but in a closed session. FOBs are smaller than a main naval base and naval operating base, as defined in the proposed measure. These will serve as an outpost in strategic locations near the West Philippine Sea and the Philippine Rise. These are naval and military facilities that can immediately carry out the Navy's mandate in the far-flung areas and as a potential site for future upgrade and expansion. Under the bill, these 12 sites are determined as priority locations for FOBs:",

      "article_body": "Commuters and motorists will have to brace for heavier traffic congestion until the “Ber” months as repairs are scheduled in some parts of EDSA by the end of March. In Joseph Morong’s Tuesday report on “24 Oras,” portions of EDSA will undergo rehaul or extensive road repair starting with the EDSA Busway northbound lane from Balintawak to Monumento. Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) Secretary Manuel Bonoan said the EDSA Busway will be replaced with new and stronger pavement. For the meantime or until the repair work is completed, the EDSA buses will use the adjacent lane while the remaining lanes are allotted for private vehicles. “Tatanggalin namin yung mga barriers nila (the barriers will be removed). The buses will have to share with the open lanes for the time being they will just have to be limited to the adjacent lanes,” Bonoan said. Meanwhile, 15 segments will be repaired in the EDSA southbound lane. After the EDSA Busway repair, the repair work will be done on the remaining lanes until the outer lane. The DPWH said it will also widen EDSA’s drainage system. “These were installed a long time ago so maliliit na yan (they are small). That’s the reason why hindi na kwan sa run off (it's not that efficient),” Bonoan said. According to the DPWH, the EDSA rehaul will take about one year until the ‘Ber’ months when traffic is usually heavier. Some commuters said it is more convenient if the EDSA Busway has its own lane for faster travel. \"Ber\" months refer to September, October, November, and December. — Mariel Celine Serquiña/BAP, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. on Monday explained why it took time for him to fulfill his campaign promise of P20 per kilo of rice. In his speech during One Cebu rally, Marcos said the government needs to provide assistance first to the local farmers, including the provision of machinery. ''Iyan po ay nakamit na natin. Hindi po naabot kaagad dahil ito po ay kailangan ayusin po natin ang ating pagtulong sa ating mga magsasaka. Kailangan bigyan natin sila ng mga makinarya,'' Marcos said. (We've attained this. We didn't achieve it immediately because we need to fix our assistance to farmers. We need to give them machinery.) ''Kailangan magtayo tayo ng mga processing center. Iyan kaya’t sinimulan po namin ito pag-upo. Dahan-dahan, dumadami na. Kaya’t kaya na naming gawin ito. Pinalitan pa natin ang batas ng NFA, halimbawa, at marami pa po tayong gagawin,'' he added. (We need to establish processing centers. That's what we started when we assumed office. It started to grow. We can do this now. We will do more.) Marcos, who served as Agriculture chief at the start of his presidency, expressed belief that the country's agricultural sector is stronger now. ''Ngunit ngayon matibay-tibay na ang agricultural sector natin. Kaya’t pinropose ko po sa lahat ng mga gobernador ng Visayas na sabi ko, 'Bakit ‘di natin subukan itong P20 per kilo dito sa inyo?''' Marcos said. (Our agriculture sector is stronger now, that's why we proposed to the governors of Visayas for us to try selling the P20 per kilo of rice in the region.) Marcos had since been hopeful about his campaign promise to reduce the price of rice to as low as P20 per kilo. He had said the aspiration hinges on fixing the value chain, or the series of stages involved in producing a product or service that is sold to consumers, with each stage adding to the value of the product or service. The Department of Agriculture has decided to temporarily halt the sale of P20 per kilo rice for 10 days in deference to the ayuda ban amid the election season. Earlier, the Commission on Elections announced that the distribution of ayuda would be banned from May 2 to May 12, or 10 days leading to the midterm elections. —LDF, GMA Integrated News",

      "date_published": "2024-08-01T12:59:00",
      "article_body": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) is “doubly confident” that Timor-Leste will affirm its earlier ruling granting the extradition request of the Philippines for former Negros Oriental Representative Arnolfo “Arnie” Teves Jr. “There’s little that they can argue in addition to what they’ve already argued before. So that’s why we are doubly confident na magkaroon ulit tayo ng [that there will be a] confirmation of the decision that was first rendered,” Justice spokesperson Mico Clavano said in an ambush interview. In June, the Department of Justice announced that Timor-Leste granted the extradition of Teves. The Teves camp filed their motion for reconsideration on the ruling on July 26, Friday before the Court of Appeals of Timor-Leste. According to Clavano, Teves’ camp had argued against the merits of the case. “This one, they’re questioning yung ano na talaga, kung ano yung naging ruling nung Court of Appeals regarding the extradition request of the Philippines, which we have won,” Clavano said. “Makapal ‘yung sinubmit nila pero the prosecutor general informed us that they are already willing and able to submit their comment na rin on the motion for reconsideration,\" he added. (The document they submitted was thick but the prosecutor general informed us that they are already willing and able to submit their comment on the motion for reconsideration.) He said that Teves’ camp only rehashed their arguments in the MR. “It seems like a rehash of all their arguments to begin with. Political persecution, the fact that we have the death penalty here and all these other arguments which have already been ruled upon before,” he said. According to Atty. Ferdinand Topacio, the legal counsel of Teves, the Prosecutor-General of Timor-Leste has 30 days to respond to the appeal. He said that Teves was “in high spirits.” The expelled lawmaker was arrested in Timor-Leste in March based on the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) red notice issued against him in February. A red notice is a request for law enforcement worldwide to locate and arrest a person pending his extradition, surrender, or similar legal action. The notice stemmed from the multiple murder charges filed against Teves for the killing of Negros Oriental Governor Roel Degamo and nine others in March 2023. Teves has repeatedly denied any involvement in the Degamo killing. READ: TIMELINE: Degamo killing and murder raps vs. Arnie Teves Teves was released from house arrest in June. Aside from the murder of Degamo, Teves and others have also been charged with the deaths of three individuals in Negros Oriental in 2019. Teves and 12 others have also been designated as terrorists by the Anti-Terrorism Council, citing several alleged killings and harassment in Negros Oriental. He was expelled by the House of Representatives in August last year for disorderly conduct and continued absence despite an expired travel authority. — RSJ/RF, GMA Integrated News",

(After a long time of waiting and efforts by the government, the remains of OFW Dafnie Nacalaban arrived tonight and will be brought to her family in the province to spend their last moments together.) Nacalaban, who was employed as a household service worker in Kuwait since December 2019, was reported missing by her second employer in October 2024. Her body was later discovered in an advanced state of decomposition in the residence of a Kuwaiti individual, two months after her employer's report. Information received by the Office of Migrant Affairs from the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait showed that the victim's body was found after a sibling of the suspect made a report to the police. There have been several deaths of OFWs in Kuwait, which led to a deployment ban by the Philippine government. But this was lifted by the Department of Labor and Employment in 2020 after the Kuwaiti government conceded to the conditions set by the Philippines during a board meeting. However, with the deaths of Nacalaban and fellow OFW Jenny Alvarado, the Department of Migrant Workers earlier said that it is mulling to impose again a deployment ban to Kuwait. —Vince Angelo Ferreras/LDF, GMA Integrated News",

Marcos and Duterte emerged as the country’s top leaders after a landslide win in the 2022 national and local elections. Their campaign centered on “unity.” The relationship between Marcos and Duterte was tested in 2023, notably by the Chief Executive’s stance on whether the current government should cooperate with the International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation into the alleged human rights abuses committed under the previous Duterte administration’s bloody drug war and the Romualdez-led House stripping the Office of the Vice President (OVP) and the Department of Education (DepEd) of which the vice president also heads as secretary, of their confidential funds in the 2024 national budget.",

      "article_body": "The Philippines was likely to hit the low end of its 6% to 7% economic growth target this year on the back of an improvement in employment and the continuous growth of manufacturing, the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) said. According to NEDA Undersecretary Rosemarie Edillon, the latest economic indicators showed that the country’s economic growth target set by the inter-agency Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBCC) could still be hit. “For the year, ang expectation namin (our expectation) is we will hit the low end of the target, if not close to it. So iyong (the) low end of the target is 6%, so either a 6(%) or ‘yon nga, very close to that 6%,” she said in a weekend news forum. Edillon cited the country’s employment data and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for the projection, as she said the agency was “hopeful about 2023.” The number of jobless Filipinos aged 15 and above fell to 2.09 million in October , an improvement from the 2.26 million in September. This translated to an unemployment rate of 4.2%, while the employment rate stood at 95.8%, and the underemployment rate was 11.7%. Meanwhile, the manufacturing output, measured by the volume of production index (VoPI), grew by 1.7% in October , slower than the 9.9% growth in the previous month, and the 6.7% increase in the previous year. “Ang kailangan na lang pong maibalik natin talaga iyong international tourism. Domestic tourism, nag-work po iyon ating holiday economics… So iyon po ‘yung kailangan pa nating ibalik,” Edillon said. (What we need to resume is international tourism. Domestic tourism worked with our holiday economics, so that is what we need to resume.) “And then, nakita rin namin with respect to government spending, so iyong second quarter was again… Kasi nakita namin may ano din ito, may parang learning curve no, marami kasing mga bago sa gobyerno. Nakita naman natin na third quarter, nakapag-catch up din, so we are actually hopeful for the rest of the year, but especially going forward,” she added. (And then what we saw concerning government spending in the second quarter was again, we saw that there was a learning curve since there were a lot of new ones in the government.

Vergeire made the remark during the welcoming of the return of the 30-man Philippine Emergency Medical Assistance Team (PEMAT), which was part of the Philippine Inter-Agency Humanitarian Contingent (PIAHC) sent to Turkey. In her message, Vergeire said PEMAT's deployment served as a step towards the country's goal to be verified based on the standards set by the WHO-EMT initiative.

      "article_body": "Health experts on Friday encouraged Filipinas to get early screening against cervical cancer in order to get early diagnosis and treatment that can help prevent this disease. Gynecologic oncologist Dr. Cecilia Llave emphasized the importance of early screening, despite not showing any signs and symptoms of cervical cancer. “It is very important that you are screened even if wala kang signs and symptoms and in order to save women’s lives, I think number one is healthy living then vaccination. Early screening kahit wala pang nararamdaman and early diagnosis and treatment can save lives of our women,” Llave said at the Department of Health (DOH) Kapihan forum. “The nice thing about cervical cancer [is that it] is treatable when diagnosed early. It is very preventable so have yourself screened now,” she added. Llave said among the cervical cancer risk factors are early sexual contact, low resistance, having many children, and having a history of sexually transmitted diseases. She described cervical cancer as a “very quiet disease” and “silent killer” as many women do not have symptoms in the early stages of the disease. However, the late signs and symptoms of the disease include bleeding especially after coitus, difficulty of urination, difficulty of defecation, hypogastric, and low back pains. The World Health Organization (WHO) mandates screening every three to five years even without signs and symptoms, according to Llave. Llave said they recommended women to get screened from ages 25 to 65. “Kahit walang nararamdaman, magpa-screen na at 25 especially when sexually active. [Also] you don’t need sexual penetration in order to get the disease,” she advised. (Even if you don't have signs and symptoms, get screened at age 25 especially when you are sexually active. And also you don't need sexual penetration in order to get the disease.) Meanwhile, Dr. Jan Llevado, DOH Cancer Control and Mental Health Division division chief, advised women to get the human papillomavirus vaccine (HPV), saying that it is safe and effective to prevent cervical cancer. “Kung ang mga kababaihan natin pumupunta sa isang health center for other services, isama ninyo na yung pagtanong sa cervical cancer screening and even to have clinical breast examination kasi dapat talaga very important na maaga natin madetect itong mga sakit na ito,” Llevado said. (If our women go to a health center for other services, you might also ask about cervical cancer screening and even clinical breast examination because it is very important that we detect these diseases early.) “Do not be afraid of vaccination kasi it has been there for many years already, it has been tested not just HPV vaccination but even COVID lahat tayo nagpabakuna. Huwag po kayong matakot,” she added. (Do not be afraid of vaccination because it has been there for many years already, it has been tested not just for HPV vaccination but even COVID, we have all been vaccinated. Do not be afraid.) The month of May has been declared Cervical Cancer Prevention Awareness Month in the Philippines. According to Guard Against HPV, a 2019 study by the HPV Information Centre showed that 7,190 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed annually in the Philippines. In 2019, the DOH assured the public that the HPV vaccine is safe and effective in preventing cervical cancer. — LA, GMA Integrated News",

Other VIPs who were invited to attend SONA 2023 include former President Rodrigo Duterte, ex-President and House Deputy Speaker Gloria Arroyo, and former President Joseph Estrada. All three former leaders have confirmed their attendance. Marcos defeated Robredo in the presidential elections in 2022. Marcos had over 31 million votes while Robredo had 15.4 million. Robredo has since chaired the non-profit organization Angat Buhay which builds partnerships among government and private sectors to generate resources for development projects in communities.

The President made the remark as he maintained that ICC has no jurisdiction over the Philippines. \"We don't recognize the warrant that they will send to us...That's a no,\" Marcos said when asked if the government would hand over an arrest warrant to his predecessor in case the ICC issues one. \"We are well within international law when we take the position of not recognizing the jurisdiction of ICC in the Philippines,\" he noted, reiterating that only countries with no functioning judicial and law enforcement system need the ICC's intervention. The President also said in February last year that he would not cooperate with the ICC investigation. He also said that he considers the ICC a threat to Philippine sovereignty. It was Duterte who pulled the Philippines out of the Hague-based ICC's Rome Statute in 2018, with the withdrawal taking effect in 2019, after the tribunal began a preliminary probe into his administration's drug war. More than 6,000 people were killed in Duterte's anti-narcotics campaign, but rights groups say that up to 30,000 may have been killed. —AOL/RF. GMA Integrated News",

      "date_published": "2024-03-07T12:16:00",
      "article_body": "Two teachers' groups have called on the Department of Education (DepEd) to suspend and review the implementation of the \"Catch-up Fridays,\" which sets aside a day in the school week to focus on improving Filipino learners' reading skills and enhancing their academic performance. More than a month since its implementation in all basic education public schools nationwide, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) said teachers are the ones who bear the brunt of additional workload in preparation and implementation of the Catch-up Fridays. \"Due to the lack or insufficiency of books or materials, teachers are forced to spend on photocopying reading materials,\" the group said. \"Instead of regular classes during this time and preparing for upcoming exams, schools were transformed into Reading Hubs every Friday, with teachers solely focused on reading activities. Regular classes were suspended,\" ACT said. ACT said DepEd's intervention programs to address learning crisis should be tailored to every individual needs of students. \"Therefore, Catch-Up Fridays should be halted, and consultations should precede any further action,\" it added. Meanwhile, Teachers' Dignity Coalition (TDC) chairperson Benjo Basas said that DepEd should not hasten the implementation of the program as it may bring more problems to the education sector, rather than solving the learning losses among learners. Even as he acknowledged that such intervention is necessary, Basas admitted that the Catch-up Fridays have brought more stress to some teachers due to the problems in schedule and the financial burden it causes. \"Sa tingin natin mga kapatid, mukhang kailangan nating i-review itong Catch-up Fridays. Ang sinasabi natin sa TDC, nagkakaisa tayo sa consensus, hindi natin kailangan itong Catch-up Fridays, with due respect sa ating DepEd, in particular Curriculum and Teaching Strand,\" he said. (We think that Catch-up Fridays needs to be reviewed. We have a consensus in TDC; we believe that we don't need this Catch-up Fridays, with due respect to our DepEd, in particular the Curriculum and Teaching Strand.) In response, DepEd spokesperson Michael Poa stressed that the department does not require students to spend money for their participation in Catch-up Fridays. ''Wala pong nire-require ang kagawaran na dagdag expenses sa ating learners sa kanilang mga magulang o pagbili ng mga booklet,'' Poa said in Marisol Abdurahman's report on ''24 Oras Weekend'' on Saturday. (The department does not impose additional expenses on the parents of our learners or require them to buy booklets.) Poa also said the DepEd was open to suggestions on how to improve the program. It was on January 12, 2024 when DepEd started designating all Fridays throughout the current school year as a \"catch-up\" day to enhance the academic performance of students in the K to 12 Basic Education Program, considering their low proficiency levels in reading, based on national and international large-scale assessments. The DepEd said that during the first half of the catch-up day, the focus will be on the operationalizing of the National Reading Program, while the second half will center on fostering values, health, and peace education. There will also be a Homeroom Guidance Program every Friday. Last week, DepEd said that it does not authorize the selling of booklets or workbooks for Catch-up Fridays, adding that school activities must not involve out-of-pocket costs. — VDV/VBL, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Lawmakers belonging to the Makabayan bloc in the House of Representatives on Monday filed a resolution seeking a congressional inquiry into the use of stock footage in the recently launched \"Love the Philippines\" tourism campaign. In their proposed House Resolution 1115, House Deputy Minority Leader France Castro of ACT Teachers party-list, House Assistant Minority Leader Arlene Brosas of Gabriela party-list, and Kabataan party-list Rep. Raoul Manuel said an inquiry was in order after the Department of Tourism terminated its contract with the advertising agency DDB Philippines. “While the DOT stressed that no public funds have been paid for the video, Congress should investigate the matter and if there are lapses in appropriate laws, rules, and regulations, especially since billions of public funds and resources are allotted for such rebranding,\" the proposed resolution read. \"Congress is duty-bound to ensure that public funds are used efficiently and effectively and that government agencies are held accountable for their actions,” it added. Under the DOT's appropriations for 2023, P1.27 billion DOT has been set aside for its branding campaign program. The amount accounts for 37.3% of the budget of the DOT-Office of the Secretary. The said budget is also 3.1 times higher than the previous year’s budget worth P309.575 million. The proposed resolution asked that the House \"through its Committee on Tourism and Committee on Good Government and Public Accountability, investigate, in aid of legislation, the controversy on the Branding Campaign Program of the Department of Tourism and the video promoting Philippine tourism that uses foreign stock footage.\" DDB Philippines has apologized for the use of non-original content and called it an unfortunate oversight. The DOT still decided to terminate its contract. President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos, Jr. said on Friday that Tourism Secretary Christina Frasco still had his trust and confidence . “I spoke to her... Nakita ko naman mabilis ang galaw niya (I saw that she was decisive in addressing the issue.) The “Love the Philippines” campaign replaced the “It’s More Fun in the Philippines” slogan, which has been the country’s tourism slogan since 2012. Frasco has also said that the DOT will stick with the “Love the Philippines” campaign despite the stock video fiasco. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

      "date_published": "2023-03-01T21:54:00",
      "article_body": "Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla on Wednesday told the United Nations Human Rights Council of the Philippines' rejection of the International Criminal Court’s (ICC) reopening of its inquiry on the killings blamed on the previous administration's war on drugs. In his speech during the 52nd session of the Human Rights Council, Remulla said \"unjustified external interference\" rarely served the cause of human rights. “The Philippines has a fully functioning justice system under the complementarity test. The ICC, therefore, has no jurisdiction over Filipino citizens whatsoever,” Remulla said told the UN's human rights body. “Let us heed the lessons of the past. Unjustified external interference has very rarely if at all, served the cause of human rights,” he added. Remulla said the Philippines respected freedom of expression \"and there are hundreds of mainstream media outfits and actors and thousands of social media practitioners.\" \"Yet, we draw the line as any sovereign state must when an international institution overreaches and departs from the boundaries of its creation,\" Remulla said. \"In this context, the Philippine government rejects the ICC’s decision to resume investigations over alleged crimes committed during the anti-illegal drug campaign,\" he added. The Philippines withdrew from the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, in March 2019. In January, the ICC authorized the reopening of an inquiry into the drug war of former President Rodrigo Duterte, a move that was not welcomed by Philippine authorities and described by Remulla as an “irritant.” The government has said that intended to appeal the resumption of the inquiry before the ICC Appeals Chamber. According to Remulla, the government believes that international human rights organizations must focus on enabling states to fulfill their obligations. \"The Philippines strongly believes that our international human rights architecture must focus more on capacitating states to effectively fulfill their obligations as duty bearers. This is a more meaningful and effective tool in human rights protection,\" he said. Remulla also said there is no culture of impunity in the Philippines. “Let me assure this council and partners and civil society and reiterate, there is no culture of impunity in the Philippines. We are doubling our efforts to ensure that individuals who breach the bounds of the law, state actors included,” Remulla said. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Researchers from the University of the Philippines Manila have developed a gout medication made of ulasimang bato, also known as pansit-pansitan. The drug, which comes in tablet form, has been shown to reduce uric acid levels in patients with gout, which is a common form of arthritis. ''Their clinical trials demonstrated a progressive reduction in uric acid levels among participants, with a 40% decrease observed by Day 14. This reduction continued, reaching up to 63% by Day 28 and up to 78% by Day 49,'' UP Manila said in an article posted on its website. ''Notably, no adverse effects were reported, in contrast to conventional gout treatments that may pose risks to kidney and liver health.'' The DOST's Philippine Council for Health Research and Development said in a separate article that the researchers found that the ideal dosage should be set at 80 mg/kg/day at first, and then lowered to 40 mg/kg/day after two weeks. Jade Rodriguez, one of the research proponents from the UP Manila Institute of Herbal Medicine of the National Institutes of Health, said the findings showed that ulasimang bato (Peperomia pellucida) ''has powerful anti-inflammatory and anti-hyperuricemia properties.'' ''It could be a safer, more natural way for Filipinos to manage gout without the risks linked to synthetic drugs,” he added. Gout affects some 1.6 million Filipinos, according to the Philippine Rheumatology Association. Its symptoms include ''sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness and tenderness in one or more joints, most often in the big toe,'' the Mayo Clinic said. According to UP Manila, efforts are underway to make the pansit-pansitan tablet accessible to the public. ''The university’s Technology Transfer and Business Development Office (TTBDO) is looking for partners to help bring this herbal medicine to market,'' it said. — VBL, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The number of registered mobile phone subscriber identification modules (SIMs) is now at over 104 million, days before the expiration of the extended SIM registration deadline on July 25, 2023. Data from the National Telecommunications Commission’s SIM registration update showed that a total of 104,076,843 SIMs had been registered as of July 19, 2023. This accounts for 61.94% of the total 168,016,400 subscriber base. Broken down, the 104.076 million registered SIMs are composed of 49.2 million Smart subscribers, accounting for 74.20% of the company’s total 66.304 million subscriber base. Globe followed with 47.47 million registered SIMs or 54.73% of its 86.746 million total subscribers. DITO Telecommunity’s registered subscribers, meanwhile, reached 7.4 million or 49.54% of its 14.964 million total customers. The Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) stood firm on the deadline, saying there will be no more extension and those with unregistered SIMs will immediately lose connection at 12:01 a.m. on July 26. Despite the deactivation of unregistered SIMs a day after the deadline, the DICT said a five-day grace period for reactivation of the disconnected SIMs will be allowed. In April, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. approved a 90-day extension of the SIM registration period until July 25 from the original deadline of April 26. The DICT earlier said it will gradually deactivate some SIM services, such as access to social media accounts and the ability to make outgoing calls, as the 90-day additional registration period moves forward. The DICT was also looking to register 70% of the total subscriber base. The implementing rules and regulations of the SIM Card Registration Act took effect on December 27, 2022, after the measure was signed into law by Marcos in October last year. The SIM Registration Act seeks to end crimes using the platform, including text and online scams, by regulating the sale and use of SIMs through mandating registration to end-users. The law mandates all telcos to submit a verified list of their authorized dealers and agents nationwide to the NTC and an updated list of the same every quarter of each year. —VAL, GMA Integrated News",

In a press briefing, PNP spokesperson Colonel Jean Fajardo said the police organization will not lower its guard especially after an encounter between members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines and NPA in Batangas. “Wala po tayong irerekomenda so far para magkaroon ng ceasefire for this holiday season at kamakailan lang dito sa Batangas ay nagkaroon ng engkwentro between the members of NPA at ‘yung ating mga kasamahan sa AFP at merong namatay at nasugatan sa hanay ng ating government forces,” she said. (We will not recommend a ceasefire for this holiday season especially after the encounter in Batangas between the NPA and AFP where members of government forces were killed and injured.) One soldier was killed while three others were hurt in the encounter. Fajardo said the PNP is also on alert for the CPP-NPA’s anniversary on December 26. “Kasama ito sa pinaghahandaan natin, we will not lower our guards, alam natin na magkakaroon at magse-celebrate sila ng anniversary nitong December 26,” she said. (We are also preparing, we will not lower our guards, we know they will celebrate their anniversary on December 26.) She further said additional personnel have been deployed to police stations in far-flung provinces, especially in areas vulnerable to NPA attacks. “Katuwang ang AFP to make sure na hindi tayo malulusutan ng mga banta sa seguridad including ‘yung police stations at detachments,” she said. (We are working with AFP to make sure that police stations and detachments are ready to face any security threats.) Fajardo said because of the encounter, the PNP intensified its border control and checkpoint operations. Last year, the AFP did not declare a ceasefire with the CPP-NPA “because of leadership vacuum within the CPP after the neutralization of many of its top leaders.” But last month, the Philippine government and the National Democratic Front of the Philippines have agreed to resume the stalled peace negotiations after their representatives signed a joint statement for \"a principled and peaceful resolution to the armed conflict.\" \"The parties agree to a principled and peaceful resolution of the armed conflict. Resolving the roots of the armed conflict and ending the armed struggle shall pave the way for the transformation of the CPP-NPA-NDFP,\" they said in a joint statement. —AOL, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Wednesday urged Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program (4Ps) beneficiaries to sign up as members of the Social Security System (SSS) in order to avail of its low-cost social insurance. Under the 4Ps AlkanSSSya Program, 4Ps beneficiaries will be given access to low-cost social insurance covering income loss and sickness, among others, with the monthly premium shouldered by the beneficiaries. The program was implemented under a memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the DSWD and SSS in July 2024. The MOA also provides the creation of a contribution subsidy table, which is based on an actuarial study conducted by the SSS and the beneficiaries' actual ability to pay the P570 minimum monthly amount. “Sa AlkanSSSya Program ay tinuturuan natin yung ating mga beneficiaries na makapag-ipon, mag-impok at maghulog doon sa kanilang SSS kasi ito ay social insurance para makatulong sa kanila kung sakaling may magka-sakit, sa panganganak, burial assistance, at iba pa,” Marie Grace Ponce, 4Ps Social Marketing Division chief, said Wednesday in the agency’s online program.

Ponce added the program aims to help 4Ps beneficiaries sustain themselves and help them from poverty. Interested 4Ps beneficiaries may contact the SSS or their city or municipal offices for the AlkanSSSya Program. — Mariel Celine Serquiña/RF, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Bivalent COVID-19 vaccines remain to be an effective tool to protect people against the recently detected Omicron subvariant FE.1, Health Secretary Ted Herbosa said Wednesday. During the rollout of the bivalent COVID-19 vaccination in the Philippines , the newly appointed chief of the Department of Health (DOH) was asked if the bivalent jabs are also effective against the FE.1, which is a sublineage of the Omicron XBB subvariant. “Yes. Generally, because this is still Omicron and nilagay na ‘yung Omicron doon sa bivalent vaccine, meron nang cross immunity ‘yan kasi ‘yung mga antigens pareho lang even if it’s a different subvariant. Hindi mahihinto ‘yan,” Herbosa said. (Yes. Generally, because this FE.1 is still Omicron, and the Omicron has been put in the bivalent vaccine. There is already cross immunity because the antigens are the same even if it's a different subvariant. It won't stop.) The first case of FE.1 or XBB.1.18.1.1 was found in the genome sequencing conducted on May 29 to June 12, 2023, based on DOH’s latest COVID-19 biosurveillance report. The DOH said FE.1 was added to the list of variants under monitoring by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on June 1, 2023, and was initially flagged “for its increasing global prevalence,” being detected in 35 countries so far. The agency, however, stressed that currently available evidence for the subvariant does not suggest any differences in disease severity and/or clinical manifestations compared to the original Omicron variant. While admitting that he is yet to familiarize with the characteristics of the FE.1, Herbosa said it may also exhibit the same symptoms as those with other Omicron subvariants. “If you have upper respiratory symptoms [like] sipon, sore throat, ubo, ‘yan ang most common. Occasionally, kagaya sa Arcturus, meron sore eyes. Itong FE.1 I don’t know if ‘yun o pareho lang. Ma-identify dapat ng genetic studies,” he added. (If you have upper respiratory symptoms like cold, sore throat, and cough, those are the most common symptoms. Occasionally, like Arcturus, there could be sore eyes. I don't know if it's the same with FE.1. It should be identified by genetic studies.) Infectious diseases expert Dr. Rontgene Solante said Tuesday that FE.1 may cause severe forms of COVID-19 infections among those most vulnerable to the virus, like the elderly population. He, however, stressed that this should not be a cause for concern among Filipinos as the hospitals in the country are well managed. He also reminded the vulnerable population to keep wearing face masks and update their vaccination with booster shots to keep themselves protected against FE.1. —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

Marcos made this assertion during the courtesy call of Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the UAE at the Malacañang Palace. He also thanked the UAE government for its aid and kindness to the Philippines especially during times of crisis. ''We owe you many expressions of gratitude for all the assistance and the kindness that UAE has extended to the Philippines and the Filipinos. And I hope that we are able to reciprocate somehow because we are very grateful for the assistance that you have done in terms of our, when there are crisis in the Philippines and then, especially to our Filipino nationals who are working in the Emirates,'' Marcos said. There are an estimated 700,000 Filipinos living and working in the Middle Eastern country, with around 450,000 residing in Dubai. ''So, I hope we'll be able to extend that relationship further and make it deeper,'' the President added. In response, Zayed Al Nahyan said he was honored to be back in the Philippines and that UAE is looking forward to having a ''better'' relationship with the country when it comes to trade. ''Our relationship is growing, but not enough. We could do much better. It could be much better because I think we have an interest to further enhance it. But also the Philippines has shown that it’s been welcoming investors, we would like to do more trade, we are on the path to finalize and sit down with the Philippines,'' he said. ''And finally, I would say Sir when the Emiratis... when they come to the Philippines they never feel leaving UAE. You really make them feel at home,'' he added. The Philippines and the UAE established diplomatic relations on August 19, 1974. The UAE and the Philippines are key partners in peace efforts, development, combating climate change, among other fields. The Emirates also gives considerable attention to assisting the development programs of the Philippine government, especially those associated with the peace process. —RF, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Amid the rising prices of onions in select markets, the Department of Agriculture (DA) on Monday said it is studying all options, including possibly importing the commodity, to lower its cost. Interviewed on GMA Integrated News’ Unang Balita, DA Assistant Secretary Kristine Evangelista said they are coordinating with onion farmers to determine how they could lower the farmgate price, which currently stands at P100 to P120 per kilo. “Medyo mataas talaga ang ating farmgate price ngayon. Tinitignan natin kung paano, kung pwede talagang i-peg na lang sana sa P100 [per kilo] ang farmgate kung saan nakabawi na ating mga magsasaka, may margins na sila,” she said. (Onion’s farmgate price is really quite high now. We are looking at how or if we could peg the farmgate price at P100 per kilo, where our farmers already have their margins.) She said the DA also has to monitor the inflow and outflow of onion stocks in cold storage facilities, and check ports and markets to determine if there are smuggled onions being sold. “Sa ngayon, wala naman tayong nakikitang imported na mga sibuyas. Pero all the angles are being looked into para we are working on bringing down the price of onions para sa ating consumers,” Evangelista said. (Right now, we don't see any imported onions. But all the angles are being looked into, so we are working on bringing down the price of onions for our consumers.) According to the Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) on Saturday, the supply of red onions in the country is enough to last until November, while that of white onions can last until September. The Samahang Industriya ng Agrikultura (SINAG) on Sunday called on the government to import white onions by July to avert a possible shortage and price increases. As for red onions, the group said the importation could be done at a later time. Evangelista said the DA will consider importing the commodity for price stability purposes. She, however, did not provide an estimated date as to when this will take place. “Siyempre, kailangan nating ma-maintain ang supply. At the same time, we will check ‘yung supply, nakakarating mismo sa palengke. ‘Pag ito ay sapat, ang presyo natin ay magiging stable,” she said. (We need to be able to maintain the supply. At the same time, we will check if the supply reaches the market itself. If this is enough, our price will be stable.) —KBK, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) is tracking all the vessels around the Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal at the time a foreign vessel rammed a Filipino fishing boat and killed three fishermen on board. According to Speaker Martin Romualdez, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. has assured that the PCG has \"deployed every resource to uncover the truth.\" \"They are rigorously backtracking and scrutinizing all vessels that were in the vicinity at the time,\" Romualdez said. Romualdez called on government agencies to extend aid to the families of fallen fisherfolk. “To assist the bereaved families during their time of grief, we advise all government agencies concerned to reach out to them immediately and extend financial support, counseling services, and legal assistance,” Romualdez said. “In these trying times, it is essential that we come together as a nation to support one another, especially the families affected,” he added. Romualdez called on all parties to “uphold maritime laws and international principles, and prioritize the safety and welfare of all individuals at sea.” House Deputy Minority Leader France Castro of ACT Teachers party-list called for more Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) patrols. The PCG initially reported that based on the accounts of surviving crew the boat was rammed around 4:30 am on Monday while they were preparing to fish some 85 nautical miles northwest of the shoal. The mother boat sank, killing three of its crew members including its captain. The incident was reported to the PCG at around 10 am on Tuesday, October 3, after the 11 surviving crew members of the Dearyn and their 3 dead finally made their way to Barangay Cato, Infanta, Pangasinan. The PCG said the foreign commercial vessel was identified as the Pacific Anna, a crude oil tanker registered under the flag of the Marshall Islands. “Given that commercial vessels have the right of innocent passage, the incident could have been prevented if there were more PCG patrols in Bajo de Masinloc, aside from preventing such accidents they can also be more effective in protecting our waters and our fisherfolk,\" Castro said. \"We extend our heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims of this act and we also hope that the funds for the PCG would be increased,” she added. \"Besides, [there's also] the harassment of Filipino fisherfolk by China's coast guard and militia have been happening for years and many were documented. Of course, we cannot forget what happened to the Gem Ver 1 fishing vessel as well as the incidents of Chinese coast guard water blasting Filipino fishing boats,\" Castro said. Castro was referring to the June 2019 incident wherein Filipino fishing boat Gem Ver 1 was sunk by a Chinese vessel in the Recto Bank which lies within the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone in West Philippine Sea. The 22 Gem-Ver 1 crew members on board, fortunately, were rescued by Vietnamese fisherfolk who saw the Filipinos around five hours after their boat was rammed by the Chinese. Senator Francis Tolentino, for his part, said the government should invest more on the Philippine National Police (PNP)’s Maritime Command (PNP-MC) in light of the tragedy. “I will propose that we increase the budget of PNP-MC, including the establishment of a base somewhere out there somewhere in Zambales, Palawan,” Tolentino said. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Philippine government is expected to raise about $3 billion from the planned dollar-denominated retail bond offering which would cater to overseas Filipino workers (OFWs), Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno said Wednesday. During the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum, Diokno said the launch of the retail dollar bond offering for OFWs, which was initially planned before the year-end, will be in the “first quarter of next year.” In October, the Finance chief announced the government will be raising funds from the debt market with a planned retail bond offering targeting OFWs , who can purchase bonds using e-wallets. As to the amount to be raised from the planned bond offering, Diokno said, “I think around 10% of annual remittances, which is about $3 billion.” However, he said the DOF and the Bureau of the Treasury are still finalizing the details of the bond offering as well as its terms. Nonetheless, he said that OFWs can invest as low as $200. Early last month, the government raised $2 billion or around P117 billion from the issuance of triple-tranche dollar-denominated bonds including five-year and 10.5-year global bonds, and a 25-year ESG or environmental, social, and governance bond. This marked the Marco administration’s debut in the offshore debt market. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

This, as the DOH reiterated that there is no need for a new law to tackle the issue and that the Responsible Parenthood and Reproductive Health Law of 2012 (RH Law) just needs proper implementation. One step to implementing the law properly is hiring health professionals or experts to teach the students, according to DOH Assistant Secretary Dr. Albert Domingo in an interview on Super Radyo dzBB. “Meron kasi tayong tinatawag na MAPEH, yung Music, Arts, Physical Education and Health. Ang implementation niton ay isa lang siya sa ‘MAPEH,” said Domingo. Instead of having only one teacher for MAPEH, Domingo said the \"Health\" subject must have a specific and adequately trained teacher. \"Mas maganda kung may designated na health teacher. Isipin niyo yung pe teacher, maton na basketball coach, tapos magtuturo din siya ng reproductive health. Parang medyo awkward yung dating. Dapat yung teacher ay properly trained, Hindi lahat at kontin lang ang merong health teacher. Baka iyan ang pwedeng solusyon,” explained Domingo. (It is better if there is a designated health teacher. Think of the PE teacher bullying the basketball coach; he will also teach reproductive health. The former seems a bit awkward. The teacher must be trained appropriately; not all, and only a few, have a health teacher. Maybe that could be the solution.) He added that since there is still a shortage of teachers in the country, employing some nurses in schools could be a solution. Meanwhile, Senate Deputy Minority Leader Risa Hontiveros introduced a substitute bill to Senate Bill 1979 with amendments addressing concerns about Comprehensive Sexual Education (CSE). Hontiveros, chair of the Senate Women, Children, Family Relations, and Gender Equality Committee, expressed confidence that the revised bill would address President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.'s c oncerns about the previous version. DOH assured that they would help Congress to create measures to teach comprehensive sexuality education (CSE) in schools more effectively.",

      "article_body": "President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. reiterated Thursday that Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) services will continue despite the looming removal of its subsidy from the government under the 2025 proposed national budget. Speaking before reporters, Marcos allayed fears that the zero subsidy would interrupt the services of the state insurer. “Napakasimple lang ng guarantee ko — kahit may subsidy, kahit walang subsidy, kahit anong contribution, all of these issues, hindi mababawasan ang serbisyo ng Philhealth,” Marcos said. (My guarantee is very simple — whether there are subsidies or not, regardless of contributions, none of these issues will reduce the services of PhilHealth.) “Hindi mababawasan ang bayad ng Philhealth sa insurance claim. In fact baligtad. Padadamihin pa namin ang serbisyong ibibigay ng Philhealth, pararamihin, palalakihin pa namin ang pagbayad sa insurance claims,” he said. (The payments from PhilHealth for insurance claims will not decrease. In fact, it's the opposite. We will be increasing the services provided by PhilHealth and we will expand the payments for insurance claims.) Senate finance committee chairperson Grace Poe previously disclosed the PhilHealth will receive zero subsidy under the proposed 2025 national budget, saying the state insurer still has P600 billion reserve funds which they can use. “I would like to just assure everybody. Huwag nyong inaalaala na mababawasan ang serbisyo kahit na kanino…Quite the opposite. Dadagdagan natin yan in 2025, mas dadami pa ang magiging serbisyo na ibinibigay ng Philhealth, mas lalaki pa ang magiging payment na ibibigay sa insurance claim,” said Marcos. (I would like to assure everyone that there will be no reduction in services for anyone. Quite the opposite. We will be expanding those services in 2025; PhilHealth will offer even more services, and the payments for insurance claims will increase.) “Kaya huwag po kayong mag aalaala, walang mawawala sa serbisyo ng Philhealth. Mas pinapaganda pa nga naming ang pagpatakbo ng Philhealth para mas marami pang maibibigay sa taong bayan,” he said. (So please don't worry, there will be no loss of services from PhilHealth. In fact, we are improving the operation of PhilHealth so that we can provide even more to the public.) Last week, Marcos said PhilHealth has enough funds to continue delivering services despite the proposed zero subsidy. Health Secretary Ted Herbosa earlier said the state insurer still has a P150 billion surplus from its 2024 budget that could pay for the subsidy of indirect members. For its part, the PhilHealth assured the public of its sufficient funds to support beneficiaries but expressed hope that Marcos would reconsider the zero subsidy decision. Meanwhile, the DOH, which is PhilHealth's supervising agency, affirmed that services would remain uninterrupted. Senator JV Ejercito earlier said he would push for an oversight committee hearing to assess the implementation of the UHC Act, citing potential lapses in PhilHealth's role. —Sundy Locus/AOL, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD) Secretary Rex Gatchalian said Saturday the distribution of the agency’s cash aid program to beneficiaries will be through a QR code-based appointment system in a bid to avoid crushing queuing for beneficiaries. Interviewed on Dobol B TV, Gatchalian said, “Starting tomorrow... lahat by appointment.” “Kung 700 'yung kaya naman i-process. Ibibigay namin ang QR stubs for 700. Kapag naubos 'yung 700 at may nakapila pa, we'll do another 700 for the following day,” the DSWD chief said. The Cabinet official said that the agency is avoiding instances where one person will fall-in line to get an appointment stub then sell it to another. “Kapag pumila, sisiguraduhin dapat may dokumento at ID dahil sila lang ang mabibigyan ng QR code,” Gatchalian said. To implement the appointment system, he said, the agency will open more payout outlets in Metro Manila “in 45 to 60 days.” “Maglalagay tayo ng [payout outlet] for CAMANAVA, sa Monumento. Maglalagay tayo sa Pasig or Marikina para sa east. Maglalagay tayo sa Taguig para sa south. Magdadagdag pa tayo ng isang opening sa SM North. Maglalagay din tayo sa San Jose del Monte [Bulacan],” he said. “Kaya kami magbubukas ng payout outlets, in the future, magkakaroon na tayo ng territorial na approach. Kapag taga-CAMANAVA, 'wag na sila magpunta sa malayo, doon na sila sa Monumento [na payout outlet]. Kung ano ang address mo, doon ka na magpunta,” he added. —LBG, GMA Integrated News",

Of the 91 Filipino volunteers, Herbosa said 32 came from the DOH Philippine Emergency Medical Assistance Team (PEMAT), who were certified by the World Health Organization (WHO). This batch’s PEMAT, which came from the Eastern Visayas Medical Center, is composed of doctors, nurses, medical technologists, pharmacists, midwives, nursing attendants, and administrative, logistics, and technical staff. “Usually ang kanilang equipment, self-sustaining, good for two weeks. Kung kailangan mag-extend, magre-resupply tayo or magpapalit,” Herbosa said in a \"Balitanghali\" interview. (Usually their equipment is self-sustaining and is good for two weeks.

      "article_body": "The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) said Wednesday the country’s export sales saw a decline in August, but exports of coconut oil has continued to increase year-to-date. Citing preliminary data from the Philippine Statistics Authority, the DTI said the Philippines registered $6.4 billion in export sales in August, down 2% from $6.5 billion in the same month last year. The Trade department said exports “were dragged by the year-on-year decline in exports of electronic products, other mineral products, machinery and transport equipment, and chemicals, which comprise 66.5% share of the country’s total exports in August 2022.” Nonetheless, year-to-date export sales amounted to $51.2 billion, up 4.4% or $2.2 billion higher than the same period last year. “[C]umulative export growth was driven by higher sales generated from coconut oil, other mineral products, chemicals, other manufactured products, and electronic products,” the DTI said. Moreover, it said that coconut oil ranked as the country’s fastest-growing export commodity group, recording a 96.2% year-to-date growth with cumulative export sales reaching $1.6 billion from January to August this year. Export earnings from coconut oil in August alone also increased to $168.2 million, up 26.6% year-on-year from to $132.9 million. “Overall, coconut oil exports have consistently been increasing at double-digit growth rates compared to three time periods: 2021, 2020, and the pre-pandemic average from 2017 to 2019,” the DTI said. The Trade department said that based on Fortune Business Insights’ Regional Forecast and COVID-19 Impact Analysis on Coconut Derivatives for 2020-2027, “several positive outcomes supported the coconut derivative market growth during the COVID-19 outbreak, which includes the rising awareness of the benefits of coconut oil usage.” “In the Philippines, scientists have also started studying virgin coconut oil (VCO) as a potential treatment for coronavirus,” it said. It added that the rapid spread of veganism globally has also resulted in increased demand for plant-based products, including coconut oil and coconut milk which are becoming considered globally as alternatives to animal fats and animal milk, respectively. Based on the International Trade Centre's Export Potential Assessment, the Philippines has the potential to expand its exports of coconut products to $2.1 billion, it said. “The DTI has been at the forefront in promoting the coconut sector in international markets. Under the Coconut Farmers and Industry Development Plan (CFIDP), the Department has been assisting coconut farmer enterprises in entering/growing their presence in global markets through the implementation of extensive market research and strategies for the promotion of coconut products,” said Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual. “We are confident that with the right set of marketing strategies, coconut products will gain more traction in international markets, especially as more markets discover the numerous health benefits of coconut products, particularly coconut oil,” the Trade chief said. —LBG, GMA News",

But somewhere along the way, it’s stalled and up to this point, there is still no progress on that. And so far, there is no plan yet or there is concrete discussion yet on the resumption of such talks,\" he said. \"Now, the coming ASEAN Summit will be just an ASEAN Summit. We will have a separate commemorative summit in Brussels for ASEAN-EU in December, and I think that could be a good venue for a discussion on that. Although, there is nothing yet on the table, as far as we are concerned today,\" he added. Earlier, the European Union has invited Marcos to visit its headquarters in Belgium to discuss foreign policy issues and bilateral relations between the Philippines and the bloc. The Philippines and the EU signed the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which provided an “enhanced legal framework,\" enabling both parties “to strengthen their bilateral relationship, in particular on political, social, and economic matters.\" —LDF, GMA News",

      "article_body": "It is highly possible that the 11 Chinese nationals who were arrested in Paracale, Camarines Norte were attempting to mine uranium, an official of the Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) said Tuesday. PAOCC spokesperson Dr. Winston Casio said they were told by engineers that the extraction technology of the foreigners could be used to extract uranium. He also said there were also possible sources of uranium in the area. “Kung kaya po, gawa ng iba ang teknolohiyang ginamit nitong grupong ito, it’s highly possible na hindi lang gold ang kanilang hinahanap kung hindi maging uranium deposits,” he said in an interview on Super Radyo dzBB. (Because the technology used by the group was not ordinary, it is highly possible that they were not only looking for gold but also for uranium deposits.) “As of this point, hindi pa naman po confirmed ‘yan. Kaya lang nasabi ng engineer na tumingin niyan sapagkat ‘yung technology na ginamit ay pu-puwedeng magamit for uranium extraction,” he later added. (As of this point this is not yet confirmed. But according to the engineers, the technology being used could be for uranium extraction.) According to the Department of Energy (DOE), uranium can be used to power commercial nuclear reactors that produce electricity. It also used to produce isotopes used for medical, industrial, and defense purposes around the world. Authorities arrested the 11 Chinese nationals over the weekend for working in an illegal mine site and for having only tourist visas. According to Casio, the Mines and Geosciences Bureau had closed off the area. “Kinakailangan ho natin mag-request sa kanila na tignan ng mabuti kung ano nga ba talaga ang purpose nung extraction plant na ito,” he said. (We need to request for them to look into the purpose of the extraction plant.) Casio said the company has the necessary environmental compliance certificate (ECC) to operate, but it has expanded beyond the coverage of the license. The arrested Chinese nationals have already undergone inquest proceedings for immigration violations. Casio said authorities are also eyeing to file criminal complaints against them. Casio said they are also investigating a local politician who may be the Chinese nationals' business partner. He said the politician hired two of the foreigners as business financiers while the rest were hired as technical experts and workers for the mineral processing plant. — KBK, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) Secretary Susan \"Toots\" Ople on Monday vowed justice for slain overseas Filipino worker Jullebee Ranara as she condoles with the grieving family of the OFW. According to the DMW, the burned body of the 35-year old domestic worker was found on Sunday in the desert. The agency said Kuwaiti authorities have arrested the son of the victim's employer. Ople, for her part, already reached out to the family of the victim. Ople vowed to provide assistance to the family of Ranara. At present, the DMW is waiting for the official report on the incident from foreign authorities. The family of the victim is requesting privacy as they grieve the death of Ranara, the DMW said. The DMW condemned the heinous crime and called on the Kuwaiti government to work on the early resolution of the case and bring the perpetrators to justice. Aside from the DMW, the Department of Foreign Affairs is also monitoring developments on the case and working as well with Kuwaiti authorities. Ranara's death is the latest of Fililpino fatalities in Kuwait in the recent years. Former President Rodrigo Duterte earlier directed the OFW deployment ban to Kuwait following the killing of Filipina domestic worker Joanna Daniela Demafelis in 2018. Demafelis was found in a freezer at an abandoned apartment in the Gulf state. Reports said Demafelis' employers, a Lebanese man and his Syrian wife, hid the body in the freezer before fleeing the apartment. Duterte then appealed to Arab nations to treat Filipino workers with dignity and respect. A partial lifting of the ban took place in May 2018 after the signing of the protection deal for overseas Filipino workers in the Gulf state. But in May 2019, the Labor Department said 47-year-old overseas Filipino worker Constancia Lago Dayag died at the hands of her employer also in Kuwait. In 2020, it was reported that Jeanelyn Villavende was killed by her female employer in Kuwait due to jealousy on December 28, 2019. Results of the autopsy made by the Kuwaiti Ministry of Health showed that the victim died after multiple organ failure following severe beating. Reports said Villavende’s female employer was served the death penalty while her husband was charged with 4-year imprisonment for covering up and not reporting the crime. Ban lifted In February 2020, the Philippine government lifted the deployment ban of Filipino migrant workers to Kuwait . Then- Labor Secretary Silvestre Bello III made the announcement after the Kuwaiti government conceded to the conditions set by the Philippines during a board meeting at the time. The Kuwaiti government has already met one of the conditions set by the Philippines, which is to file charges against the employers of Villavende. Bello also said that Kuwaiti officials have agreed to craft a harmonized standard employment contract for Filipino workers. Under the new contract, Filipino workers will be allowed to take one day off with pay each week. The contract will also state the designated working and sleeping hours of the worker. Over the weekend, the DMW said it was looking to repatriate all distressed overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Kuwait by the end of January . Of the 421 distressed Kuwait OFWs, the DWM had repatriated 142 since January 17, 2023. — Anna Felicia Bajo/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

Wearing a black polo shirt and fatigue pants, Zelenskyy met with President Ferdinand ''Bongbong'' Marcos Jr. this morning at Malacañang Palace. ''Thank you for this invitation and we are very thankful to be in your country which supports Ukraine, our territorial integrity and sovereignty. Thank you so much of your big word, and clear position about us, about this Russian occupation of our territories and thank you on your support on the, in your nations, with your resolutions,'' Zelenskyy told Marcos. ''Mr. President, I’m happy to hear today from you that you participate [in] our peace steps,'' he added. In response, Marcos said the Philippines is very much willing to continue helping Ukraine through multilateral platforms such as the United Nations and the European Union in order to achieve peace amid its ongoing conflict with Russia. ''We’ll continue to do all that we can to promote.... to promote peace and to bring an end to the fighting and to come to a political resolution of your country,'' Marcos said. ''I think everybody fully understands that it is easier said than done and it will be a difficult road to find our way back to the situation that is morally acceptable not only to Ukraine, but to the rest of the world,” he added. Marcos stressed that the Philippine government has been promoting the adherence to international rules-based order as he reiterates the country's advocacy for peace. Zelenskyy also said in a post on X that the Philippines would participate in the peace summit that will be held in Switzerland this month. ''We discussed the inaugural Global Peace Summit and the importance of Southeast Asian countries being represented there. I am pleased that the Philippines will participate in the Summit,'' he added. There is no official word yet from the Philippine government howerver on whether Marcos would personally attend the Global Peace Summit or a representative will be sent. 'Elated' Marcos was elated over Zelenskyy's visit to discuss issues similarly faced by the two countries. Marcos, though, expressed hope that their meeting would be under ''better circumstances'' amid the unfinished war Ukraine is facing against Russia. Zelenskyy also told Marcos Ukraine would open an embassy in the Philippines this year. The Ukrainian president arrived in Manila on Sunday evening for a visit that was kept well under wraps. He flew in first to Singapore on Saturday, June 1, for what Reuters described as an \"unscheduled\" appearance at the Shangri-La Dialogue. The Philippines had expressed its support for Ukraine's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, voting at the UN General Assembly to denounce Russia’s invasion, expressing “explicit condemnation” against “the use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of any state.” —KG/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Speaking before his counterparts in the region, Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. urged member-states of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to unite amid ongoing threats in the West Philippine Sea. In a statement, the Department of National Defense (DND) said Teodoro made the call during a speech Wednesday at the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) Retreat in Penang, Malaysia. \"ASEAN has ensured the longest period of peace in any region since World War II. However, this peace is now under threat—not due to our incapacity to preserve it, but because of the absence of unanimity on key issues,\" he said. Teodoro said threats to Philippine sovereignty, sovereign rights, and jurisdiction in the WPS are not just a domestic or regional concern, but a \"global issue\" that affects international stability. The ASEAN needs to remain cohesive and proactive in upholding regional stability, Teodoro said, as well as in defending international law and norms. The Philippine defense chief urged the ASEAN to enhance operational cooperation by expanding joint patrols, exercises, and intelligence-sharing to build trust among defense forces. He also warned against external attempts to sow division within Southeast Asia and advised member-states to reject external influences that seek to fragment the region. For Teodoro, the ASEAN must maintain independence and strategic autonomy. The Philippine defense chief also cited criminal activities that threaten the region. \"We should resist coercion in whatever form and exchange information on foreign activities that are inimical to our national interests, such as online scams, trafficking in persons, illegal migration, which destroy the fabric of our respective societies,\" he said. \"We may not always agree, but the spirit of ASEAN compels us to cooperate where we can, consult where necessary, and act when we must,\" he added. Tensions continue as Beijing claims almost all of the South China Sea, a conduit for more than $3 trillion of annual shipborne commerce, including parts claimed by the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Brunei. Parts of the South China Sea that fall within Philippine territory have been renamed by the government as West Philippine Sea to reinforce the country's claim. The West Philippine Sea refers to the maritime areas on the western side of the Philippine archipelago including Luzon Sea and the waters around, within and adjacent to the Kalayaan Island Group and Bajo de Masinloc. In 2016, the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague ruled in favor of the Philippines over China's claims in the South China Sea, saying that it had \"no legal basis.\" China has refused to recognize the decision. — VDV, GMA Integrated News",

Marcos said Justice Secretary Remulla is \"very aware that he must allow the processes of the judiciary to work properly and that no one in the Executive must interfere.\" He also said Justice chief has taken the \"very proper position\" of recusing himself from any involvement in his son's case. Juanito was nabbed in connection with the shipment that was intercepted at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. A report on the arrest and seizure showed that authorities confiscated one parcel containing 937 grams of dried leaves of suspected kush \"with a current street value of P1,311,800.\" The operation, a controlled delivery, was conducted by agents from the PDEA and the NAIA Inter-Agency Drug Interdiction Task Group at BF Resort Village in Talon Dos, Las Piñas on October 11 around 11:10 a.m. The elder Remulla has said he would not intervene in his son's \"predicament.\" He also said it is a difficult time for him and his family. “I am both a father and the secretary of Justice, roles that I take very seriously. We all know about unconditional love, but at 38 years old, he will have to face his predicament as a fully emancipated child,” Remulla said. \"I will not intervene in nor influence my son’s predicament, and I have not done so in any way… A person should always face the consequence of their actions and I will let justice take its own course,\" he added. Remulla earlier said he arrived in the Philippines from Geneva, where he attended the United Nations Human Rights Committee, on Thursday afternoon. PDEA said a complaint for importation of dangerous drugs under the Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 and for failure to exhibit or deposit documents under the Customs Modernization and Tariff Act has been filed against the younger Remulla. In a message to reporters, Prosecutor General Benedicto Malcontento said prosecutors in Las Piñas will handle the matter fairly. \"Clear and directions ni SOJ dyan. He will not interfere. Rest assured that our prosecutors in Las Pinas will resolve the matter fairly and independently,\" Malcontento said. —with Joahna Lei Casilao/KBK/RSJ, GMA News",

      "article_body": "The Bureau of Customs (BOC) said Friday its strict border control measures against illicit cash smuggling have played a crucial role in the Philippines’ removal from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Grey List. According to the BOC, its intensified crackdown against smuggling, deployment of cash-sniffing dogs, upgraded baggage scanning systems and expanded capacity-building for customs personnel led to a 455-fold increase in currency declarations as well as in 194 cash seizures in 2024 alone. To recall, the Philippines is no longer among the countries under the watch of an international body for money laundering and countering financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). In a statement issued over the weekend, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force (FATF) announced that the Philippines is no longer under increased monitoring. When the FATF places a country under “grey list” or increased monitoring, it means that a country committed to resolving the identified strategic deficiencies within agreed timeframes and is subject to increased monitoring. The BOC said that the deployment of cash-sniffing dogs in major ports and the installation of advanced baggage scanning equipment have improved the detection of undeclared and suspicious currency. Further, the agency intensified its capacity-building initiatives, training customs personnel on AML/CTF protocols and enhancing intelligence-sharing with the Department of Information and Communications Technology, Philippine Coast Guard, Office of Transportation Security, Department of Justice, and the Anti-Money Laundering Council. These efforts resulted in an unprecedented increase in enforcement actions, with the number of cash seizures in 2024 exceeding the total recorded in the previous decade. — Anna Felicia Bajo/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Department of Energy (DOE) on Wednesday welcomed the Supreme Court (SC) decision which affirmed its authority to take over the oil industry in times of emergency. In a 37-page decision, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals’ ruling that declared Section 14(e) of Republic Act 8479 or Oil Deregulation Law unconstitutional. Section 14(e) of the law states that “in times of national emergency, when the public interest so requires, the DOE may, during the emergency and under reasonable terms prescribed by it, temporarily take over or direct the operation of any person or entity engaged in the Industry.” The SC, in its decision, said Section 14(e) of RA 8479 is “a proper delegation of takeover power to the DOE.” With this, the DOE said it respects and supports the ruling of the Supreme Court upholding the constitutionality of Section 14(e) of Oil Deregulation law that authorizes the DOE in times of national emergency to temporarily take over or direct the operation of any person or entity engaged in the downstream oil industry. “The DOE is committed to implementing Section 14(e) of the said law as the public interest may require in times of national emergency, in accordance with the Constitution and the applicable laws and consistent with the President’s intent or instructions,” the Energy Department said. “The DOE will study fully with the Department of Justice and the Office of the Solicitor General the clarifications made by the Supreme Court and will take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that this measure of last resort is properly exercised whenever needed,” it added. The SC cited Section 23 of the Constitution that provides limitations on the takeover power. “In line with this constitutional provision is a well-established doctrine of qualified political agency. The doctrine recognizes the multifarious responsibilities a president faces, which calls for the delegation of certain responsibilities to cabinet members,” the high court said. “It posits that the heads of the various executive departments stand as the president’s alter egos permitted to act on behalf of the president,” it added. However, the Court said that if the energy secretary acts in contrast with the president’s intent or instruction, the act will be deemed ultra vires (acting or done beyond one's legal power or authority) and an unconstitutional usurpation of executive power. “Moreover, it must first be demonstrated that the president withheld approval or repudiated the delegation or the actions of the delegated authority,” the SC added. The DOE said it will also continue to consult and work with all stakeholders on maximizing and diversifying sources of energy supply, enhancing its distribution and availability to the public at reasonable prices, managing the prioritization of demand to avoid or minimize potential constraints, and strengthening overall capacity to bounce back from interruptions. — Ted Cordero/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno on Wednesday expressed optimism that the government will surpass its collection goal this year, banking on the Bureau of Customs (BOC) revenue surplus. “Our collection as of one month ago is P2.9 trillion, [over] 18% higher than last year and about 90% of our goal for the year,” Diokno said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. “I’m very sure we will exceed our revenue target,” he added. Data from the Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) showed that the national government’s revenues as of end-October stood at P2.9 trillion , up 18.31% from P2.5 billion raised in January to October 2021. The cumulative collections are 89% of the P3.3 trillion revenue target for the entire year. Diokno said the BOC already met its annual target while the Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) was “slightly behind.” From January to October, the Customs collected P713.5 billion, up 35.81% year-on-year and 99% of the P721.5 billion full-year goal. On the other hand, the BIR collected P1.9 trillion, 12.56% over the same period last year and reaching 80% of the P2.4 trillion target. Asked if the revenue surplus of the BOC will be enough to cover the shortfall of the BIR, Diokno said, “Definitely.” The BOC earlier reported that it collected P745.50 billion as of November 11, surpassing its collection target of P721.52 billion for the entire year by P23.98 billion or 3.27% . The Customs attributed the positive revenue performance to stringent implementation of priority programs to curb smuggling and corruption, optimize revenue collection, and digitalize and enhance customs operations anchored on the eight-point Socioeconomic Agenda of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Meanwhile, Diokno said the economic managers or the Development Budget Coordination Committee (DBBC) will meet on December 5 to review the government’s macroeconomic targets. “We will review the numbers and maybe we can upgrade the forecast, but we will just affirm the 6.5 to 8% [for next year,” he said. The economy as measured by GDP, or the total value of goods and services produced, grew by 7.6%during the July to September period, faster than the upwardly adjusted 7.5% GDP growth in the second quarter of the year. The DBCC set a GDP growth target of 6.5% to 7.5% for 2022 and 6.5% to 8% for 2023. — RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) on Friday approved fare increases for traditional and modern jeepneys, buses, taxis, and transport network vehicle services (TNVS). In a statement, the LTFRB said it released a decision on the petitions filed by several transport groups. The public land transportation regulator approved a P1 provisional increase in the minimum fare for first four kilometers travel in both traditional and modern jeepneys. “Upon the effectivity of the decision, the minimum fare for traditional public utility jeepney (TPUJ) will be P12, while for modern PUJ (MPUJ) will be at P14,” the LTFRB said. The agency also green-lighted an additional fare of P0.30 per succeeding kilometer for TPUJ, while an additional P0.40 per succeeding kilometer will be implemented for MPUJ. “Based on the increase, the fare for succeeding kilometer run TPUJ will be P1.80 from the current P1.50, while for MPUJ will be P2.20 from P1.80,” the LTFRB said. For public utility buses (PUB), the land transportation regulator approved a P2 uniformed base fare hike for city and provincial buses for the first five kilometers and the succeeding kilometer fare increase of P0.35 to P0.50 depending on the type of bus. The LTFRB said PUB operators asked for P4 to P7 base fare hikes and per succeeding kilometer rate ranging from P0.45 to P1.20. The flagdown rate for taxis and TNVS was also adjusted upwards by P5.00. “Upon effectivity of the decision, the minimum fare for taxis and Sedan-type TNVS will be P45, while AUV/SUV-type TNVS will be at P55. For hatchback-type TNVS, flagdown rate will be P35,” the LTFRB said. “There will be no increase in the succeeding kilometers,” it said. The decision on fare increases will take effect 15 days after publication in a newspaper of general circulation or around the first week of October. The LTFRB said the 20% discount for senior citizens, persons with disability and students will still be effective. The agency earlier said that it recognizes the need for a fare increase following the continuing rise of oil prices. The LTFRB said it consulted the National Economic Development Authority (NEDA) and the Department of Energy (DOE) on the matter. “In the decision released by LTFRB, the agency conducted a study through its Franchise Planning and Monitoring Division (FPMD),” it said. The FPMD used the fare adjustment formula based on Memorandum Circular 2019-035, the opinion of different stakeholders, increasing operational cost of PUVs and the opinion of the NEDA, according to the LTFRB. Moving forward, the agency reminded drivers to follow the guidelines and policies of the agency, and adhere to public health safety protocols. Violations will be dealt with accordingly. —NB, GMA News",

      "article_body": "The COVID-19 pandemic showed the Philippines could ill afford to continue its dependence on importation to have a sufficient supply of food at affordable prices, President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr. has said. Asked at the 10th Asia Summit in Singapore about the Philippine economy post pandemic, Marcos said the country had \"come back fairly well... we have been able to return people to work and we just posted a 96% employment rate.\" Marcos, however, pointed out that the Philippines had been hounded by problems on supply chains and agricultural production. \"But this is a lesson that we immediately learn. I said, we cannot now continue to depend on importation which is what has happened for the Philippines. In the past years, it became the easy way out,\" Marcos said. \"Just import more, import more rice, import more corn, import more everything. And the pandemic showed us that this was not a wise choice to have made,\" he added. Marcos said the Philippines continued to develop its agricultural sector \"and the aspiration once again is that we are able to provide sufficient supply of food at prices that people can afford.\" \"We are not there yet but we have made many important steps to start that,\" Marcos said. \"We are trying to put the value chain, especially of agriculture, we are trying to put that value chain together, all the way from R&D, all the way to retail, to the market,\" he added. Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno over the weekend said the department had proposed the reduction of the 35% rice import tariff rates \"both ASEAN and MFN [most favored nation] rates, temporarily to 0% or maximum of 10% to arrest the surge in rice prices.\" Diokno said rice was the biggest contributor to inflation as he emphasized the need to propose a tariff reduction for rice imports. Marcos in early September ordered the imposition of price ceilings on regular and well-milled rice . Regular rice's price cap is at P41; well-milled rice at P45. He said the measure was only temporary and adverted to rice imports that will soon arrive. Marcos has blamed smugglers and hoarders for the increase in the prices of rice. The Department of Agriculture in mid-August recommended the importation of 500,000 metric tons of rice to address the thin supply in the buffer stock. —NB, GMA Integrated News",

(As for the whereabouts of Mayor Guo, we have information from other agencies that she is still here in the Philippines.) The embattled mayor is facing an arrest order from the Senate after she repeatedly failed to attend its inquiry on the raided Philippine Offshore Gaming Operator (POGO) hub in her locality. Earlier in June, the Department of the Interior and Local Government filed graft charges against Guo with the Office of the Ombudsman, prompting it to suspend her for up to six months. Authorities have also filed a human trafficking complaint with the DOJ against Guo in relation to the POGO hub in Bamban. Guo did not personally attend the preliminary hearings of the department. She was represented by her lawyers. Guo’s lawyer, Atty. Stephen David, said his client talked to him on Wednesday night and assured him that she was still in the country. “Ang assurance niya sa akin na nandito naman siya sa Pilipinas (she assured me that she is still in the Philippines),” he said in an interview on Balitanghali. Despite this, David said that Guo is unlikely to attend the Senate hearings. According to Ty, the next preliminary hearing will be held on August 6, where Guo’s camp is expected to file their counter affidavit on the complaint. Meanwhile, Guo’s citizenship is also being questioned due to her inconsistent testimonies about her background and the supposed dubious documents regarding her Filipino citizenship. The Office of the Solicitor General has also filed a quo warranto petition against Guo, which may result in her removal from public office. In July, it filed a petition seeking to cancel Guo’s birth certificate. The OSG earlier said if cancelled, Guo would lose her most important defense evidence about her identity. Meanwhile, David said the quo warranto petition against Guo is premature, noting that she has a birth certificate. “May presumption of regularity tayo. Kaya nga nag file sila ng kaso sa Tarlac, pinapa walang bisa ‘yung kanyang birth certificate. Edi dapat antayin muna nila ‘yung resulta noon,” David said. (There is a presumption of regularity. That’s why they filed a case before Tarlac asking the court to nullify her birth certificate. They should first wait the result on that.) “Kung totoong hindi siya Pilipino, tsaka sila mag file ng quo warranto (if it’s true that she is not a Filipino, then they can file the quo warranto),” he added. David said they have yet to receive an official copy of the petition, but that he will file a motion to dismiss. — AOL/RSJ, GMA Integrated News",

In a statement, the BAI said that, on April 30, its Animal Disease Diagnosis and Reference Laboratory reported positive results from duck samples collected during a routine surveillance by the DA Regional Field Office V (DA-RFO V). It said that the subtype H5N9, while highly pathogenic in birds, “poses low risk to humans based on current global assessments.” Following the detection, the BAI said it promptly endorsed disease control measures to DA-RFO V, including immediate quarantine, culling, surveillance, and coordination with local authorities, and notified the Department of Health (DOH) to monitor any potential human exposure. The DA-RFO V had also activated its Command Center and convened its Regional Quick Response Team to enforce control protocols. The agency said coordination meetings with the regional DOH, the Provincial Government of Camarines Sur, and the Municipality of Camaligan have also been conducted to streamline actions. “Culling and proper disposal of the remaining ducks in the affected farms were done on May 6, 2025,” it said. “Intensive surveillance within the one-kilometer quarantine zone will begin today, May 7, 2025, followed by monitoring and disinfection measures,” it added. The DA RFO V, in close coordination with the BAI and local government units, will also implement sustained disease control operations including surveillance within the one-kilometer and seven-kilometer zones and thorough cleaning and disinfection of affected sites to prevent further spread. “Rest assured that BAI is committed to protecting the Philippine's poultry industry from the threat of avian influenza and will maintain close cooperation with other government agencies and stakeholders,” the agency said. “We encourage the public to remain vigilant and report any unusual poultry deaths or signs of illness to local authorities for immediate action,” it added. —VAL, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Department of Agriculture (DA) on Wednesday said it is considering measures including having pork retailers display product details such as their suppliers, as the majority are still not complying with the maximum suggested retail price (MSRP) set by the agency last month. According to DA spokesperson Arnel de Mesa, Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. wants retailers to display the farms that supply them with pork, aside from the certificate from the National Meat Inspection Service (NMIS) that consumers see regarding the slaughter, to determine which suppliers are still selling at higher rates. This comes as De Mesa said that there is only 39% compliance with the MSRP, which has already seen a gradual increase since its March 10 implementation: P300 per kilo for fresh carcass or “sabit ulo,” P350 per kilo for kasim and pigue, and P380 per kilo for liempo. Citing price monitoring efforts of the DA, de Mesa said several retailers still have prices above the MSRP, as in the case of those in markets such as in Pritil Market, Trabajo Market, and Cartimar Market. Latest available data from the DA’s price monitoring on its website shows that prices of kasim and pigue ranged from P340.00 to P400.00 per kilo, and liempo from P350.00 to P470.00 per kilo in Metro Manila markets as of Monday, March 31, 2025. “[The Secretary said that he] was very disappointed with what happened coming from the agreements among the stakeholders and with the department,” De Mesa said in a briefing on Wednesday. Retailers have since admitted difficulties in complying with the MSRP , as they said they cannot sell other pork cuts, forcing them to offset losses through kasim and liempo sales. They also cited expenses for biosecurity amid threats of illness such as the African swine flu. “‘Yung sa baboy, parang he felt na madali ‘yung naging mga nagkasunduan, so medyo kinabahan siya dahil naging madali ‘yung agreement, baka magkaroon ng problema ang that’s happened,” De Mesa said. “So he shared na kapag madali, ‘pag minsan may problema, so ngayon, dahil may ganitong issue, talagang siyempre kailangan din gumawa ng paraan para masolusyonan,” he added. (For pork, he felt that the agreement was easy, so he was slightly nervous that there would be a problem, and that’s happened. So he shared that if it is easy, sometimes there are problems so now, because of this issue, we really need to make ways to address this.) — BM, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "Twenty-seven victims were rescued while 10 individuals were arrested for human trafficking in separate operations in Pasay City, the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) said Tuesday. NBI Director Jaime Santiago said that of those rescued, six were minors. Santiago said they have been turned over to the Department of Social Welfare and Development. Meanwhile, six of those arrested are Chinese while four are Filipinos. \"Napa-inquest na natin sila and they were accordingly charged (They have undergone inquest proceedings and they were accordingly charged),\" Santiago said in a press conference. According to NBI Cybercrime Division Chief Atty. Jeremy Lotoc said this stemmed from two operations within a week. Lotoc said that the crime involved foreign nationals and their modus was called the \"Romeo Method\" or the \"Loverboy Tactic.\" He said their objective was to establish romantic relationships with their victim and then \"groom\" them. \"'Yung grooming. Nililigawan nila ito and then tine-treat nila specially. And then 'yung isolation. So ina-isolate nila ito sa kanilang friends and families to make the victim dependent doon sa trafficker in terms of financial needs and emotional needs,\" he said. (The grooming. They court the individual and treat him or her specially. Then there's the isolation. So they isolate the victim from their friends and families to make them dependent on the trafficker in terms of financial and emotional needs.) Following this, he said the victims would then be exploited and brought into the sex trade. He said the minors were offered through a messaging app. In a statement, the NBI said the arrests were the result of operations on Sept. 6 and 7, when agents raided units of a condominium complex in Pasay City. The alleged Chinese ringleader and two companions were nabbed during hot pursuit, the NBI said. \"The operatives also discovered that the group is using various technologies such as social media and online platforms, generative AI, encryption and anonymity tools, and online market place in their illegal sex trade, offering trafficked victims for sexual service, including minors,\" the statement said. — VDV, GMA Integrated News",

      "article_body": "The Department of Information and Communications Technology on Tuesday warned the public about the spread of \"deepfakes\"—videos that mimic the voices and images of prominent personalities—as the 2025 midterm elections draw near. According to Jonathan Andal's report on \"24 Oras,\" the DICT called on the House of Representatives to craft a law to regulate artificial intelligence which is being used to come up with false footage. \"We believe that, especially with the upcoming elections, this particular threat might increase,\" DICT Undersecretary Jeff Ian Dy said before a House committee hearing. He cited the fake videos that featured the face and voice of GMA host Susan Enriquez, who was made to appear that she was promoting the distribution of a particular necklace from Italy. “Gamit po ang kanyang video, pati yung kanyang audio recording na di-nub doon sa video niya to make it look like she’s endorsing a particular product, when in fact she did not,” he added. (They used her video and her audio recording, dubbed in the video to make it look like she's endorsing a particular product when she was not.) Cybersecurity expert Art Samaniego said a law is needed to prevent the threat of AI before the elections. \"Wala pa tayong batas laban sa deep fakes. Malapit na po ang election dapat gumawa tayo ng batas dito para ma-regulate ang paggamit ng AI,” Samaniego said. (We still don't have a law against deep fakes. The election is coming. We should make a law to regulate the use of AI.) Aside from the deepfakes, the DICT also reported that Chinese hackers caused the cyber attack that happened on some government websites. Among those targeted by hackers are the websites of those watching over the West Philippine Sea, namely the Philippine Coast Guard and the National Coast Watch System. They also targeted DICT, the Department of Justice, the Congressional Police and Budget Research Department of the House of Representatives, and President Ferdinand \"Bongbong\" Marcos Jr.'s private website. However, the DICT said they currently have no evidence to say that this hacking attempt has the blessing of the Chinese government. \"The type of attack used is very sophisticated. I would call it theoretically perfect — pinagaralan at magagaling yung gumawa ng malware,” said Dy. (The malware's creator is good, and it was thoroughly studied.) —Sherylin Untalan/NB, GMA Integrated News",

In a statement, the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) underscored \"the need for a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in Ukraine in line with the principles of the UN Charter.\" \"The Philippines has articulated its principled position on Ukraine and has consistently supported Ukraine’s sovereignty, independence, unity and territorial integrity, voting in favor of the six resolutions of the UN General Assembly Emergency Special Session on Ukraine,\" the DFA said. Ukraine was home to nearly 400 Filipinos and since the war broke out, the Philippine government was able to bring home dozens of Filipinos from the eastern European state. Russian troops launched their attack on Ukraine on February 24, 2022, drawing international condemnations, warnings and sanctions from countries, led by the US, with US President Joe Biden calling Moscow’s move “unprovoked and unjustified.” At the UN, the Philippines joined 140 countries in denouncing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, expressing “explicit condemnation” against “the use of force against the political independence and territorial integrity of any state.” \"The Philippines reiterates its call on concerned parties to seek a peaceful and diplomatic resolution to the conflict,\" the DFA said as it cited the 1982 Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes which reaffirms the principle that all states shall settle their disputes by peaceful means. —KG, GMA Integrated News",

According to Vonne Aquino's report on \"24 Oras Weekend\", despite DSWD's announcement that walk-ins are not allowed to claim the cash aid, many still took their chances trooped to DSWD central office. Citing DSWD data, the report said that as of 2 p.m. on Saturday, over P100M was paid out to to over 42,000 beneficiaries. In Casiguran, Aurora, some senior citizens queued up for the payout but were sent home since they had no confirmed schedule. Other walk-in applicants insisted that they submitted an online registration but received no text confirmation. Some argued they could not open the website, but the DSWD said that the technical issue is just temporary. Meanwhile, the cash distribution was canceled in Batanes, Ilocos Sur, and Tanay, Rizal, due to bad weather conditions. Authorities said they would resume distribution on another day. For those who do not have gadgets or access online, the DSWD is conducting an off-site payout. They are currently cooperating with the local government units to find the poorest of the poor to distribute the education assistance, which is ongoing in Calabarozon, Mimaropa, and Western Visayas. DSWD said they are trying to speed up the distribution, noting that online registration is open until September 25, 2022. —LBG, GMA News",

      "article_body": "The Holy Week exodus to holiday destinations begins in earnest today, alongside the rites of Palm Sunday. All agencies of the national and local governments must ensure the safety of the public in this peak travel season. This includes ensuring the travel worthiness of mass transport facilities on land, sea and air. The nation has seen too many deadly road accidents due to the loss of brakes on poorly maintained vehicles as well as reckless driving. Inter-island ferries have also sunk and motorized boats have capsized even in calm waters and fine summer weather due to overloading, with passengers drowning because of the absence of requisite lifesavers. Before the weekend, the Maritime Industry Authority announced that it had suspended four ships due to safety issues. Authorities in smaller ports must also tighten inspection of vessels used for public transport. An audit of the structural integrity of public works infrastructure has yet to get underway, over a month after a section of a new bridge in Isabela province collapsed after a truck transporting rocks drove through it. While waiting for experts to inspect structural integrity, public works personnel and local government units can display prominently at the entrance to bridges advisories on weight and height limits for vehicles, and promote compliance. Owners of mass transport and logistics enterprises must do their part by ensuring the roadworthiness of their vehicles and compliance with weight and height limits. Public safety includes protection from scams and violent crimes. The Department of Tourism is encouraging the public to book accommodations and other travel-related requirements only with accredited establishments to avoid scams. The Philippine National Police, assisted by local force multipliers, must intensify patrols and other security measures. The PNP has yet to catch the killers of a Slovak tourist who was found dead with signs of rape and beating in Boracay, one of the country’s top travel destinations. Metro Manila, meanwhile, which typically becomes like a ghost town during the Holy Week break, must be secured from burglars. Firefighters must be on alert as fires can break out in homes and workplaces whose occupants are on vacation. The country has had sufficient experience with possible problems during the Holy Week break. There is no excuse to be unprepared.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of National Defense ordered the Armed Forces of the Philippines to ramp up its presence in the West Philippine Sea to defend the country’s territory amid reports of encroachment. The DND gave the marching orders on Thursday following Bloomberg’s report, citing unnamed Western officials, earlier this week that detailed how Beijing is reclaiming more land in Spratly Islands, particularly over Eldad Reef (Malvar Reef), Lankiam Cay (Panata Island), Whitsun Reef (Julian Felipe Reef), and Sandy Cay. The activities were monitored close to Pag-asa Island. “Any encroachment in the West Philippine Sea or reclamation on features therein is a threat to the security of Pag-asa Island, which is part of Philippine sovereign territory,” the Defense department said in a statement. “It also endangers the marine environment and undermines the stability of the region.” The DND also called on China to uphold international rules-based order and avoid actions that can further increase tensions in the West Philippine Sea and the South China Sea. The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier expressed concern and said that “relevant” agencies are verifying details of the report. It added that the activities were breaching the Declaration of Conduct on the South China Sea (DOC) as well as the 2016 Hague ruling, which Beijing refuses to recognize. READ: Philippines ‘concerned’ over report on China’s construction activities in Spratlys However, China has denied claims on the Bloomberg report, with Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said that the report is “completely untrue.” “Refraining from action on the presently uninhabited islands and reefs of the Nansha Islands is a serious common understanding reached by China and ASEAN countries in the [DOC] and China always strictly abides by it,” Mao said in a press concerence on Wednesday. “The growth of China-Philippines relations currently enjoys sound momentum, and the two sides will continue to properly handle maritime issues through friendly consultations.” The development comes less than two weeks before President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. visits China upon the invitation of President Xi Jinping. Analysts have called on the chief executive to bring up the issue during his meeting with his Chinese counterpart, making clear the Philippines’ foreign policy on the West Philippine Sea.

      "date_published": "2025-04-08T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang asserted on Sunday that there is no basis for Sen. Ronald “Bato” dela Rosa to seek assistance from the US in freezing the assets of the owner of the aircraft that flew former president Rodrigo Duterte to the Netherlands, emphasizing that the US respects the sovereign prerogatives of its allies. The statement came after Dela Rosa, during a Senate hearing on Duterte’s arrest, suggested that the US government – specifically President Donald Trump – should be informed about the inquiry’s findings. He argued that the Gulfstream G550 aircraft owner falls under the scope of Trump’s executive order that sanctions individuals facilitating the activities of the International Criminal Court (ICC), which he claims interferes with the interests of US allies. Dela Rosa, a staunch Duterte ally and former chief of the Philippine National Police who oversaw the administration’s controversial anti-drug campaign, warned that the aircraft owner should expect “repercussions” under the executive directive. However, Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro countered the senator’s assertion, clarifying that the executive order cited by Dela Rosa does not extend to interfering with decisions made by US allies. Castro underscored that the order explicitly states that Washington honors the sovereign decisions of countries choosing to engage or not engage with the ICC, in accordance with their domestic laws. “If our country and our government decide to cooperate with the Interpol, in accordance with RA 9851, that will not be prevented by the US and the country’s sovereign prerogatives will be respected. So I do not see any possible reason for Senator Bato to run to the US and seek help to freeze the assets of the owner of the aircraft,” she said. Castro also clarified that the Philippines, designated as a major non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization ally under the American Service-Members’ Protection Act of 2002, is included in the group of countries whose sovereign decisions are acknowledged by the US, as outlined in Trump’s executive order signed in February.",

Health Undersecretary Lilibeth David said that all services and activities of the DOH, including COVID-19 pandemic response efforts, other disease prevention and control, and health promotion matters are ongoing. The agency earlier said that \"everything is status quo until new directives from our new president come in.\" David also said the department is \"eagerly\" awaiting the announcement of the new secretary. \"We look forward to working with our new secretary on delivering services that promote the people’s health,\" she was quoted as saying during the agency’s first flag ceremony under the Marcos administration.

This comes as the Philippines sees an increase in COVID-19 cases driven by the presence of fast-spreading variants with immune escape characteristics, increased mobility, and waning vaccine immunity. The Philippines logged 1,323 additional COVID-19 cases Sunday, the highest daily rise since February 24. “The president is quite aware and in fact, one of the priorities is managing the effects of this pandemic. So you must also understand that this is so important. They must look very closely and carefully at the candidates,” Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles said in a press briefing Monday. The names of National Task Force against COVID-19 adviser Ted Herbosa and DOH Technical Advisory Group Edsel Salvana have been floated as possible replacements for Francisco Duque III, former President Rodrigo Duterte's health chief. Cruz-Angeles also said there is no deadline set to complete Marcos’ Cabinet. Marcos also has yet to appoint the next heads of the environment, energy, and science departments. \"I understand [he] is going through the final evaluation stage.

      "date_published": "2024-12-14T13:03:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Funds with no specific allocation in the proposed 2025 national budget remain significant, as the bicameral conference committee earlier this week added another P373 billion to the executive branch's initial proposal. The National Expenditure Program, which outlines the executive branch's proposed budget, initially requested P158.6 billion in what officials call \"unprogrammed funds.\" However, at the bicameral conference of both chambers of Congress, increased this amount by P373 billion, bringing the total to P531.66 billion. Unprogrammed funds are defined by the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) as allocations without guaranteed funding.Funds are only allocated for the project when the government secures additional resources or revenues. Under the Marcos administration This is not the first time Congress has approved a higher amount of unprogrammed funds than requested by the Executive branch. In 2024, unprogrammed funds reached a staggering P731.44 billion, making it the second-highest allocation for such items since 2016, surpassed only by the 2023 budget. For 2024, the NEP initially sought P282.9 billion in unprogrammed funds, but Congress increased this by P449.5 billion—a move that drew criticism from opposition lawmakers. Key projects, including major transportation initiatives and military modernization efforts, were unexpectedly placed under unprogrammed funds, surprising some legislators. READ: Unprogrammed funds on the rise: Questions that hound the 2024 budget Senate's perspective In a chance interview on Wednesday, December 12, Senate budget sponsor Sen. Grace Poe commented on the reduced scale of unprogrammed funds for 2025 compared to previous years. “Our unprogrammed funds are not like before when many items were placed under it. Now, it is lower,” Poe said. If approved, 2025 would mark the fourth consecutive year that Congress has increased unprogrammed funds beyond what was requested by the Executive branch. Previous allocations In recent years, Congress has consistently raised unprogrammed fund allocations: For 2022, Congress increased the Executive's request of P151.63 billion to P251.63 billion. For 2023, Congress raised unprogrammed funds to P807.16 billion from the NEP’s original request of P588.162 billion. The DBM has previously explained that categorizing items under unprogrammed funds does not indicate they are low priority. Instead, these projects may lack certain requirements such as complete documentation or finalized loan agreements. Philstar.com has reached out to both DBM and House budget sponsor Ako Bicol Partylist Rep.

In the same release, the DMW said that it has been working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine Embassy in Kuwait to address the situation, which, Kuwait Times reported, was prompted by Manila's alleged violations of a 2018 bilateral labor agreement. \"The DMW stands ready to assist our OFWs affected by this action of the Kuwait government,\" it said. \"We urge our affected Kuwait-bound OFWs to connect with us directly through the National Reintegration Center for OFWs (NRCO) hotlines at 09567821309 and 09603532532 or to email nrco@dmw.gov.ph so we may assist them.\" DMW, which had been fielding questions from media about the Kuwaiti government's decision this week, said it had been informed by the DFA of the suspension on issuing visas to Filipinos. \"We shall continue to pursue the track of labor diplomacy in ensuring the welfare and safety of our overseas Filipino workers, while we await more details as to the rationale and issues surrounding the action of the Kuwait government,\" the department said. DMW stopped the deployment of newly-hired domestic workers to Kuwait in February \"until more safeguards are in place for their protection and welfare.\" The deployment ban was prompted by the killing of overseas Filipino worker Jullebee Ranara in Kuwait in January. In a statement earlier Friday, the DFA said it is committed to dialogue with Kuwait to resolve the issue. \"In the case of Kuwait, we are confident that with our friendly relations and strong people-to-people links, we shall be able to find a mutually satisfactory solution that will take into account the need to provide maximum protection and access to justice for all our nationals working in the country,\" it also said.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Marikina City took a major step toward becoming a national startup hub with the launch of the Philippine Innovation Hub on Wednesday. Led by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) and the National Development Co. (NDC), and championed by Marikina Rep. Stella Quimbo, the new facility at the Marikina Enterprise Center aims to centralize support for entrepreneurs and realize the vision of a “Marikina Startup Valley.” The hub stems from Quimbo’s long-held vision to address challenges faced by small businesses and creatives. A former shoe entrepreneur, Quimbo sought to unite government, industry and innovation under one roof. “What if we could bring government, industry and innovation under one roof?” she said during the launch, envisioning a space where ideas can thrive and scale. Located in a city once known primarily for shoemaking, the innovation hub offers integrated services including technical assistance, startup incubation, streamlined regulations, digital onboarding and investor matching – all in one place. The goal: help Filipino businesses formalize, innovate and compete globally without leaving Marikina. NDC general manager Saturnino Mejia called the Hub a model of cross-sector collaboration. “What we’re launching here is not just a space – it’s a mission,” Mejia said. “One that’s rooted in shared progress and built for real impact.” The opening of the Hub’s first two floors marks only the beginning, with expansion plans already underway and growing interest from global investors, Quimbo said. The economist-lawmaker noted Marikina’s competitive edge. “Marikina has always had the talent, the creativity, and the grit,” she said. “What we’re building now is the structure that will let that talent lead – not just locally, but globally. This is how we begin the future. This is how we build Marikina Startup Valley.”",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines underscored the importance of a landmark declaration approved by world leaders on Sunday on action guidelines for the international community to resolve global issues. Manila welcomed the Pact for the Future, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations and hailed them as “triumph of the persistence of multilateralism to affirm that a better world is possible, with the solidarity of nations.” Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo said the Pact for the Future “renews collective determination to defuse tensions and seek the peaceful resolution of disputes and conflicts.” “In pledging to the Pact, states abide by the obligation of rejecting force and the threat of use of force to settle disputes,” Manalo said. Manalo is the head of the Philippine delegation to the Summit of the Future, the 79th Session of the United Nations General Assembly High-Level Week and other related meetings from Sept. 22-29 at the UN headquarters in New York. The Summit of the Future, a high-level event, brings world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how to deliver a better world for present and future generations. Under the theme “Multilateral Solutions for a Better Tomorrow,” the summit aims to strengthen global cooperation in addressing the most pressing challenges of our time. “The Pact binds us in words and in action, bridging the collective hopes of the past with our contemporary aspirations, with the UN Charter anchoring our will,” he said. The secretary said multilateralism, with the UN at the center, flourishes on the grounds of a rules-based order that provides conditions for trust, solidarity, equity and peace. “Respect for the rule of law safeguards global peace and security and enables the international community to confront complex current and future challenges together,” he stressed. The pact can guide the UN in delivering meaningful outcomes for peace and security, for human rights, for fairness and equality, for resilience from crises and disasters and for empowering individuals and all communities in the world. “As a founding member of the UN and the first Asian republic, the Philippines shall always be a voice for peace, equity and justice, human rights and human dignity, the rule of law and constructive multilateralism,” he added. The Pact along with its annexes, the Global Digital Compact and the Declaration on Future Generations, was adopted by consensus, despite a last-minute proposal for an amendment by some countries, including Russia, Iran, North Korea and Syria. The amendment sought to incorporate text calling for non-intervention in any issue of national sovereignty and the primacy of intergovernmental deliberation, in effect, downplaying the role of civil society or private sector interests. It was rejected after the 193-member assembly decided not to act on the proposal. Manalo will deliver the Philippine national statement during the UNGA General Debate and present the Philippines’ advocacies and priorities in line with the agenda of the UN General Assembly’s 79th Session.",

      "date_published": "2023-06-27T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — If the government were its student, the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) would give it a “failing grade” for not being able to address critical issues hounding the country’s education sector. Assessing the first year of the Marcos administration, ACT secretary-general Raymond Basilio yesterday said the government failed to prioritize or give urgent action to any of the 10-point challenge issued by teachers and education workers last year. “In his first year in office, we saw Marcos Jr.’s extreme neglect and lack of action to address the crisis in education and economy,” Basilio said in Filipino. “This was matched by the dismissal of the calls from teachers and other sectors by Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, who is more focused on red-tagging as co-vice chair of the NTF-ELCAC,” he added, referring to the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict. Last year, the ACT identified 10 demands to the then incoming administration of Marcos and Duterte. These include doubling the education budget, reopening the schools safely, implementing evidence-based recovery program, providing sufficient learning resources, overhauling the K-12 system and restoring Philippine History in high school and wika (language) and panitikan (literature) in college. The other five demands included upgrading the salary of teachers and education workers, hiring more education support personnel, improving education workers’ benefits, enacting a Magna Carta for private school teachers and upholding academic freedom and union rights. The government has not prioritized the ACT’s first five demands, abandoned the next four and gravely violated the last one, according to the group. While the Department of Education (DepEd) under Duterte pushed for the full reopening of schools last year, the ACT noted the gaps in ensuring the safety of students and teachers. It also repeatedly criticized the government over its failure to address the lack of teachers, non-teaching staff and education facilities. Last January, Duterte presented her Basic Education Report, where she identified key challenges and her agency’s plans for the education sector. Basilio maintained that their assessment of the government has concrete basis, as he noted the lack of budget for the education sector. “It is clear that it was not given priority last year. Teachers and other workers were abandoned, as seen in the lack of action on our call for salary increase, especially with the worsening economic crisis,” he said in Filipino. “The promise made during the elections that the salary of teachers would be increased remains unfulfilled. We also have a record-breaking delay in the release of the 2021 PBB (Performance-Based Bonus) of our teachers. There is no development in the legislation for the Magna Carta for private school teachers,” he added.",

      "date_published": "2023-12-26T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Nine members of the New People’s Army (NPA) were killed in a bloody Christmas Day clash between government forces and the communist rebel group in Bukidnon. Soldiers of the military’s 403rd Infantry Brigade under the 4th Infantry Division also recovered at least eight firearms from the encounter sites in four Malaybalay City villages yesterday. The fatalities are yet to be identified. Government troops are conducting operations against remaining members of the NPA unit operating in the area. Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) public affairs office chief Xerxes Trinidad said soldiers initiated a sustained offensive after receiving reports of NPA presence in the hinterlands of Barangays Can-ayan, Kibalabag, Kulaman and Mapulo. During the initial scouring, operating troops seized eight firearms from the encounter site. They expect to find more as operations continue in coordination with local communities that are also helping identify the casualties. “This incident further diminishes the capability of the NPA to conduct atrocities in Bukidnon and nearby provinces,” Trinidad said. The clash occurred as the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) announced on Sunday that the NPA would observe a unilateral ceasefire on Christmas Day, Dec. 25, and Dec. 26, which falls on the CPP’s 55th founding anniversary. Call to lay down arms Instead of making what it describes as “empty statements,” the military called on remaining members of the NPA to lay down their arms and surrender. “The task given to the AFP is clear and we will comply with it. We will be watchful and our operations will continue unabated to keep our communities safe and end the communist armed conflict, once and for all. The defeat of this threat aligns with the collective wish of all Filipinos,” Trinidad said. “The unilateral ceasefire declared by the CPP is an empty statement as they do not have the leadership and support of the masses. Their ammunitions are depleted and their members – supporters included – are surrendering,” he added. Trinidad assured the public that the AFP will keep watch despite the truce. “Their capability to plan and stage attacks was already diminished, but we are expecting harassments to create unnecessary disturbance or noise. Nonetheless, our forces on the ground were already warned and are ready,” he said. “It is much better for them to abandon the armed struggle. Laying down their arms and returning to the fold of the law in order to be with their families is the rational path forward towards a united, peaceful and progressive country,” Trinidad said. Defense Secretary Gilbert Teodoro Jr., in an interview over ANC Sunday night, clarified that formal peace talks with the CPP-NPA have not yet resumed. Only exploratory talks are ongoing. “I think it was underemphasized that these are not peace talks,” he stressed, explaining that peace talks are “a hurdle which we have not crossed.” Teodoro stressed that if formal peace talks resumed, there would be a cessation of law enforcement operations against the CPP-NPA-National Democratic Front, and a cessation of activities of the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict.",

      "date_published": "2024-11-20T14:37:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Executive clemency for Filipina domestic worker Mary Jane Veloso is possible, despite her not facing charges in the Philippines, said former Justice Secretary and current Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra. Guevarra made this statement in a message to Philstar.com when asked about the National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers' request for President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to extend executive clemency to Veloso. Guevarra explained that the alleged crime was committed in Indonesia where Veloso was tried, convicted and sentenced by the court. “So only the president of Indonesia can grant her executive clemency as an act of sovereign grace,” Guevarra said. However, he said the granting of clemency by Marcos is not “impossible.” “Theoretically, PBBM cannot, but it is not impossible if such grant of executive clemency be agreed upon by the two heads of state,” Guevarra said in a message to Philstar.com. On Wednesday, November 20, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said that Veloso is finally returning home to the Philippines after 14 years of incarceration in Indonesia due to a conviction on drug charges. However, Marcos did not specify the exact date of Veloso’s return. It is also unclear what would be Veloso's status upon her return to the country — whether she's a free woman or still a person in custody. \"I extend my heartfelt gratitude to President Prabowo Subianto and the Indonesian government for their goodwill. This outcome is a reflection of the depth our nation’s partnership with Indonesia—united in a shared commitment to justice and compassion,\" Marcos’ statement read. \"We look forward to welcoming Mary Jane home,\" he added. Veloso was arrested in 2010 on charges of drug trafficking. In 2015, former President Benigno Aquino III made a last-minute appeal to Indonesia to spare Veloso’s life after her illegal recruiter surrendered to authorities in the Philippines. Veloso was scheduled to be executed by firing squad in the early hours of April 29, 2015. The reprieve was granted so close to the time set that some print media mistakenly reported her execution. What is an executive clemency Executive clemency is a power granted to the president of the Philippines by the Constitution. It is provided under Article VII, Section 19 of the 1987 Philippine Constitution which provides: \"Except in cases of impeachment, or as otherwise provided in this Constitution, the President may grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures, after conviction by final judgment. He shall also have the power to grant amnesty with the concurrence of a majority of all the Members of the Congress.\" However, the president cannot grant clemencies in cases of election offenses or impeachment. Clemency should only be granted after a conviction of a final judgment, except in the case of amnesty, which can be applied to individuals yet to be convicted. 4 People Reacted How Do You Feel About This Article?

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — All 17 local government units of Metro Manila will soon enforce ordinances regulating the use of electric vehicles and imposing fines on offenders. The Metro Manila Council (MMC), composed of the mayors of the 17 Metro Manila LGUs, and the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) came up with a resolution containing rules that would govern the use of e-bicycles, e-tricycles, kuliglig and e-scooters. The MMC and MMDA will require users of e-vehicles to secure a driver’s license, according to acting MMDA Chairman Romando Artes. Under MMDA Regulation No. 24-022 series of 2024, the agency banned e-vehicles along major roads under its watch, particularly circumferential roads such as Recto Avenue or C-1, Quirino Avenue or C-2, Araneta Avenue or C-3, EDSA or C-5, Katipunan Avenue and C. P. Garcia Avenue or C-5 and Southeast Metro Manila Expressway or C-6. E-vehicles will also be prohibited along radial roads like Roxas Boulevard or R-1, Taft Avenue or R-2, South Superhighway or R-3, Shaw Boulevard or R-4, Ortigas Avenue or R-5, Magsaysay Boulevard and Aurora Boulevard or R-6, Quezon Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue or R-7, A. Bonifacio Avenue or R-8, Rizal Avenue or R-9, and Del Pan/Marcos Highway/MacArthur Highway or collectively R-10. The ban also covers Elliptical Road, Mindanao Avenue and Marcos Highway, the MMDA added. The MMDA would impose a P2,500 on e-vehicle users caught traversing these roads and impound the vehicles, Artes declared. Meanwhile, San Juan City Mayor Francis Zamora – also MMC president – said each of the 17 Metro Manila LGUs would pass their respective ordinances tackling similar prohibitions, as well as identifying more roads in their respective areas covered by the ban. Artes pointed out that the rules may become effective by April this year as they have to be studied by the Land Transportation Office.",

      "date_published": "2022-10-25T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — President Marcos should be given enough time to continue the campaign against illegal drugs, including the possibility of reinstating the death penalty for drug traffickers and other heinous criminals, Sen. Bong Go said. Go lauded Marcos for continuing former president Rodrigo Duterte’s fight against illegal drugs, one of the priority programs of the previous administration. “I am happy because President Marcos mentioned the fight against illegal drugs. He has his own method and style in fighting illegal drugs,” said Go in Filipino. “And I have confidence in him, let’s give him enough time...” He expressed belief that if authorities will not check the situation, the sale and use of illegal drugs will again become rampant and breed criminality and corruption in government. Go emphasized the need to intensify efforts to fight these social ills by reiterating the link between drugs, crime and corruption. “When you are on drugs, it can lead to corruption and criminality. Ordinary citizens cannot walk at night for fear of getting victimized by drug addicts. Criminals should be the ones afraid to walk at night, not the ordinary Filipino who just wants to live a quiet life and their children can go home without being hurt or molested,” he said. Citing his continuing advocacy of promoting sports as a way to combat said social ills in the country, the senator then encouraged Filipinos to get into sports and stay away from drugs. “We should give the youth other things to do. Remember that when you are into sports, your body is better, you are able to exercise, you are able to play, you are sweating... But with illegal drugs, your body is already damaged, your brain will be damaged,” he added. At the same time, Go also expressed support for reimposition of the death penalty, especially for those involved in illegal drugs and plunder. The vice chair of the Senate committee on public order and dangerous drugs expressed his support for proposals to reinstate the death penalty for heinous crimes related to illegal drugs and plunder. Go mentioned that he had earlier submitted a bill to reinstate the death penalty during the 18th Congress. “When I became a senator, I also filed another version (of the death penalty). There are many versions of the death penalty, especially for illegal drugs,” said Go. “So, I agree with the death penalty on illegal drugs, it depends on the quantity… You know, when you become a victim of illegal drugs, it’s gone, you’re addicted. This drug becomes addictive and your fear will disappear.” In previous interviews Go has expressed willingness to refile the death penalty measure. The senator emphasized that the reinstatement of death penalty is in line with Duterte’s crusade against illegal drugs, criminality and corruption. He added that the imposition of capital punishment can discourage criminal activities. “There must be fear. One method is death penalty. Why should you be afraid of the death penalty if you are not guilty, if you obey the law. You have nothing to fear,” he said.",

      "date_published": "2024-02-27T17:44:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "The British Chamber of Commerce Philippines (BCCP) remains concerned of the reported delay of quota distribution to meat importers–noting it may cause inflationary pressures in the country which echoed the sentiments of the Meat Importers & Traders Association (MITA), in a letter addressed to Department of Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. yesterday. BCCP Executive Director/Trustee Chris Nelson emphasized how it may impact supply, existing trade agreements, and may undermine the efforts to fight inflation–citing the consistent efforts of BCCP and the significance of the recent signing of the Executive Order No. 50 which warranted the extension of lowered tariffs for pork due to present economic condition of the country. In a recent interview: “We are very strong supporters of the extension of the Executive Order [50], we believe strongly that allowing pork to come at lowered tariff rates is a help for inflation and food security. In that context, we would not wish to see a suspension of MAV. As we’ve discussed on previous programs, pork supply has been impacted locally due to African Swine Fever and there’s definitely a need to further continue pork imports.” Based on the report, a provisional minimum access volume import certificate (MAVIC) would be issued to licensees with only 25% of the tentative annual allocation for the pork MAV. The British Chamber further noted that it welcomes any inputs and dialogue with the Department of Agriculture, and other relevant parties to avoid concerns which may lead to the disruption in the supply chain, food security, and inflation. Previously, the British Chamber also expressed its concerns on the reported suspension of MAV for pork imports that may impact inflation and food security–taking into account the challenge facing the African Swine Fever (ASF), which remains to be active in 8 regions, 12 provinces, 28 municipalities and 122 barangays, as reported by the Bureau of Animal Industry. Meanwhile, the British Chamber consistently advocated for the extension of lowered tariffs under and urged the passage of the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act–further improving the agricultural sector while aiming to safeguard the local farmers and consumers against unfair market practices and support local industries. “We hereby acknowledge the role of agriculture in the Philippine economic growth and we look forward to the Bicameral Conference and therefore, the passage of the Anti-Agricultural Economic Sabotage Act.” The British Chamber has consistently advocated and reaffirmed the UK-PH trade–with the latter being the 2nd largest pork export market in Asia, further improving the domestic market by introducing quality and safe British meat to their local counterparts, contributing to the overall bilateral trade.",

The Philippines is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate change impacts such as strong cyclones, flooding, and sea level rise. “The rich world talks a great deal but does a lot less about it (climate change) than those with much less, but have suffered more death and destruction from climate change and lack of adaptation,” Marcos said. Climate finance Climate Reality Project Philippines manager Nazrin Castro told Philstar.com that the organization is hoping that Marcos will bring the responsibility of the developed world to climate-vulnerable countries to climate change negotiations. Castro urged Marcos to demand wealthy nations to deliver their commitment to mobilize $100 billion annually in climate finance, and ensure the Philippines will have a voice in the COP27 climate talks on the establishment of the loss and damage financing facility for developing countries. Marcos is invited to attend COP27 in Egypt this November. In its first Nationally Determined Contribution, the Philippines committed to slash its carbon emissions by 75% by 2030 from sectors of agriculture, waste, industry, transport, and energy. However, a bulk of this commitment is hinged on foreign funding and assistance. Marcos also stressed that the Philippines has to play its part in addressing plastic pollution. The Philippines is among the top contributors to the marine plastic crisis. “We won’t shirk from that responsibility, we will clean up.” Energy transition Marcos mentioned in his speech that there are “tried and proven ways of mitigation” as he once again took credit for the wind farm in Bangui, Ilocos Norte, claiming he built it. He did not. The wind farm is a project of Ayala-owned North Wind Power Development Corp. He also hinted at tapping oil and gas as the prices of gas and diesel continue to rise. “But surely, a free world awash with oil can assure supplies or we will find a way. We are not far from oil and gas reserves that have already been developed,” Marcos said. The Philippines is scaling up the development of infrastructures that will support the import of liquefied natural gas in anticipation of the depletion of the Malampaya deep water gas-to-power project in Palawan. But groups like the Center for Energy, Ecology, and Development warn that this blocks the transition to cleaner and cheaper renewable energy. “We, however, lament his position on fossil fuels and his failure to mention the critical role of renewable energy in addressing our issues on energy, specifically reliability, affordability, and security,” Castro said. “At this point, the clean energy transition must be pursued because it makes good economic sense. The climate change mitigation factor is just a co-benefit,” she added. Be The First To React How Do You Feel About This Article?

      "article_body": "To achieve high, sustainable growth MANILA, Philippines — The government will need to quickly address issues in infrastructure to achieve high and sustainable growth, according to think tank GlobalSource Partners. “Sound infrastructure is one big challenge to the Philippines’ bid for high and sustainable economic growth. Unless the issue of infrastructure is decisively and quickly addressed, it may instead drag the momentum of growth down,” GlobalSource Partners country analysts Diwa Guinigundo and Wilhelmina Manalac said. They said the new infrastructure projects approved recently by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) Board chaired by President Marcos could simply lengthen the government’s list of infrastructure deliverables. New projects approved by the NEDA Board earlier this month are the Facility for Accelerating Studies for Infrastructure Project (FAST-Infra Project) and the Infrastructure for Safer and Resilient Schools (ISRS) Project. With a project cost of P2.75 billion, the FAST-Infra Project aims to develop a robust transportation infrastructure investment program in line with the Philippines’ sustainable development goals. Meanwhile, the ISRS would involve the repair, rehabilitation, retrofitting and reconstruction of schools destroyed by natural disasters like typhoons and earthquakes. Also approved earlier this month were extension of the implementation period and loan validity of the Support for Parcelization of Lands for Individual Titling Project, as well as the extension of implementation period of the LRT Line 2 East extension project. While the approval and completion of these key infrastructure projects would lead to more efficient production and distribution of goods, as well as encourage more foreign investments into the country, Guinigundo and Manalac cited the pace at which projects are being completed. Of the 13 projects aimed at establishing physical connectivity, water resources, digital connectivity and health, the NEDA reported as of end-November 2023 that only one was completed last year in the Visayas. All the other 12 will be completed this year. “With the new projects, and many others still to be completed, the list of flagship projects continues to lengthen; the likelihood of everything being completed becomes uncertain,” Guinigundo and Manalac said. There are 185 infrastructure flagship projects (IFPs) worth over P9 trillion under the government’s list of priority projects. As priority projects, the IFPs will be provided the necessary support for efficient and faster implementation. The government is aiming to achieve six to seven percent economic growth this year. In the first quarter, the economy expanded by 5.7 percent, slower than the 6.4 percent growth in the same quarter in 2023, but faster than the 5.5 percent expansion in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health has called on the Department of Trade and Industry to prohibit the access of Filipinos, especially young people, to vaping products to protect them from the harmful effects of e-cigarettes. The DOH said in a message to reporters that the DTI should also “proactively scan the market and confiscate” unregistered products and those that violate the Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Act, including those with flavors that are found to attract young people. Under the law, the DTI has exclusive jurisdiction over any and all issues, requirements and subject matters related to vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products. Only duly-registered vaporized nicotine and non-nicotine products with the applicable graphic health warnings are allowed to be sold, advertised or distributed through whatever means. The DTI has the power to issue an order directing that a non-compliant website, online application and social media account be taken down and preventing noncompliant online merchants from selling vaping products. The DTI earlier appealed to e-commerce platforms to police their sellers, and ensure there are appropriate age verification mechanisms and graphic health warnings in all listed products. For its part, the health department said it continues to inform the public about the health risks of vaping through community-level efforts to promote and establish smoke-free and vape-free environments and through social media campaigns. It also issued and is implementing graphic health warnings for vapor products to raise awareness on the adverse effects of vaping. “Lastly, we encourage our provincial and local governments to implement our smoke-free and vape-free playbooks, such that we are enabled to live in a healthier environment,” the DOH said. The Vaporized Nicotine and Non-Nicotine Products Regulation Act lapsed into law in July 2022. The DTI issued the law’s implementing rules and regulations in December 2022. The law allows individuals as young as 18 years old to purchase vaping products, prompting criticisms from health and child rights organizations that it will bring e-cigarettes closer to young people. — with report from The STAR/Catherine Talavera Be The First To React How Do You Feel About This Article?

      "date_published": "2023-03-13T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — Kabataan Party-list has filed Resolution 816 to urge the House Committee on Transportation to investigate, in aid of legislation, the Public Utility Vehicle Modernization Program of the Department of Transportation. The resolution said that many operators continue to avoid entering into the PUVMP due to high cost to change their vehicles, besides the possibility of losing their livelihood once they enter the franchise consolidation. It said that under this program, jeepney operators and drivers are being compelled to purchase modern jeepneys or mini buses worth at least P2.4 million each through loans from financial institutions. Greg Perez, president of Pagkakaisa ng mga Samahan ng Tsuper at Opereytor Nationwide (PISTON)-Cebu, said this is precisely the reason why they are against the modernization program as small-time cooperatives cannot afford the high cost of the modernized unit, considering that the government subsidy for each unit is only P160,000. Although PISTON-Cebu did not join the nationwide strike initiated by their counterpart in Metro Manila last March 6, 2023, Perez said they support the call of the latter and several transport groups in Metro Manila in scrapping the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board Memorandum Circular No. 2023-013 that was issued on February 20, 2023. MC No. 2023-013 states that individual operators of traditional jeepneys will no longer be allowed to continue their operations after June 30, 2023 unless they start joining a cooperative or a corporation. The LTFRB, on the other hand, has already extended the deadline from June 30, 2023 to the end of December 2023. However, only those individual operators who are able to join an existing consolidated entity on or before June 30, 2023 shall be allowed to have their provisional authority extended until the end of the year. According to the authors of the said resolution, the program, in the guise of modernization, is simply a corporate takeover of the PUJ sector that would not only result to massive loss of livelihood of the transport workers, but also would severely affect the public since PUJ is still the most used mode of public transport system. The authors are Representatives Raoul Danniel Manuel of Kabataan PL, France Castro of ACT Teachers PL, and Arlene Brosas of Gabriela Women’s Party. The resolution also states that traditional cooperatives only control or own the franchise, and jeepneys can still be owned by the operators but consolidation requires the operators to surrender to the ownership of the cooperative or corporation the franchise and the unit itself. The DOTr and the LTFRB implemented in June 2017 the PUVMP which aims to phase out all jeepneys that are 15 years old and older as a mode of transportation through DOTr Department Order 2018-011, also known as the Omnibus Guidelines on the Planning and Identification of Public Road Transportation Services and Franchise Issuance or simply known as the Omnibus Franchising Guidelines. These traditional jeepneys are then replaced with brand new ones or the modern jeepneys powered by an electric powertrain or at least a Euro 4 compliant diesel engine to conform Philippine National Standards. — GMR (FREEMAN)",

Pasang Masda, Busina, Altodap, ACTO, Stop & Go, UV Express and LTOP held a rally over the weekend to support Guadiz after a former LTFRB employee said that at least P5 million was being paid in exchange for the approval of franchise or securing routes and special permits from the agency. Jeff Tumbado, the former head executive assistant of Guadiz, has since rescinded his statement even as he alleged that corruption could have reached the Department of Transportation and Malacañang.

      "date_published": "2024-07-24T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "Despite extreme weather conditions MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) remains optimistic it will hit its target of expanding local farm and fisheries output by one to two percent this year amid extreme weather conditions. Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said the expansion in farm areas brought about by new irrigation systems nationwide, both traditional and solar-powered, would contribute to higher agricultural output this year. Nonetheless, Tiu Laurel noted that hitting their production targets would not be “too easy” given the challenges brought about by climatic conditions at the onset of the year. He cited the presence of El Niño in the first half as one of the major production challenges this year and the expected La Niña phenomenon this second half. Farmers and fisherfolk incurred losses amounting to almost P10 billion this year due to hotter and dryer weather conditions brought about by El Niño. “We are hopeful, barring strong typhoons, we will post higher (agricultural)] production,” Tiu Laurel said during the government’s post-SONA briefing yesterday. The agriculture chief is also banking on the efficacy of an African swine fever vaccine set to be tested by the government to finally control or put an end to the devastation being caused by the fatal disease on local pig production. The DA earlier maintained its palay production target of 20.4 million metric tons for the year. The agriculture and fisheries sector grew by 0.4 percent in 2023, according to the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA). The value of local agriculture and fisheries output in the first quarter remained relatively flat as subsectors reeled from the El Niño phenomenon, with poultry being the lone subsector posting higher production. The PSA said the value of agriculture and fisheries production at constant 2018 prices reached P428.99 billion, about P200 million higher than the P428.79 billion in the same quarter in 2023. The PSA said the value of production of crops, livestock and fisheries subsectors all contracted, but the poultry subsector registered an increase. In an earlier interview, Tiu Laurel said he was “cautiously” optimistic that the agriculture and fisheries sector would perform better in the second quarter as a result of the various interventions that the government made against El Niño. Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa earlier said the overall performance of the agriculture and fisheries sector would have contracted if the government had not rolled out its mitigating measures against El Niño.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Once motorcycles can be legally recognized as taxis, the government plans to organize motorcycle taxi drivers into cooperatives that can establish their own ride-hailing platform, chief of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board said. LTFRB chief Teofilo Guadiz III presented before a House panel on Tuesday the initial findings of the four-year pilot study on motorcycle taxis, part of which included recommendations on how to improve the income and benefits of motorcycle taxi drivers. Guadiz said that once a law is enacted to include motorcycles as public utility vehicles, the Office of Transportation Cooperatives under the Department of Transportation can allow riders to organize as transport cooperatives. “In the future, transport cooperatives may apply to be accredited TNCs that will have their own platform,” Guadiz said during his presentation. The pilot study is still ongoing, according to the LTFRB chief, but its initial findings suggest that full-time motorcycle riders can earn as much as P40,000 monthly, based on estimates provided by ride-hailing app Angkas. Guadiz added that another recommendation by the motorcycle taxi technical working group (TWG) is to help cooperatives access loaning facilities and avail of government benefits such as the Social Security System, Philhealth and Pag-ibig. Another recommendation by the TWG is to explore additional passive income for riders, such as providing them “interest on share capital” as well as “patronage refund. “In the event that RA 4136 (Land Transportation and Traffic Code) is amended to include Motorcycles as Public Utility Vehicles, the OTC sees this as an opening to deliver its mandate to a wider array of stakeholders,” Guadiz said. “The Office is ready and more than willing to cater the motorcycle taxi sector and push its development which will be beneficial to our transport system as a whole,” he added. The TWG’s initial findings are based on a survey of 1,524 motorcycle taxi riders from three major ride-hailing platforms: Angkas, Joyride and MoveIt. These motorcycle-hailing apps are currently allowed to operate on a provisional authority with a total cap of 45,000 participants in the study. The motorcycle taxi study was initiated by the DOTr in 2019 to evaluate the safety of motorcycles-for-hire in ride-hailing platforms. The study also aimed to give the government enough time to thresh out legal issues concerning the use of motorcycles as a mode of public transport as the current Land Transportation and Traffic Code prohibits the use of private motorcycles for hire. Drivers working for ride-hailing platforms and transportation network companies are considered independent contractors who shoulder their own fuel costs and vehicle maintenance. While they have to remit their own government benefits, motorcycle taxi drivers of Angkas get accident insurance and medical reimbursement insurance, according to the study.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — International testing, inspection and certification provider SGS has offered to inspect imported agricultural products to the Philippines to help monitor leakages in trade, according to Go Negosyo founder Joey Concepcion. In a statement yesterday, Concepcion said he had a meeting with SGS vice president and regional operations manager (Asia) George Bottomley last March 31, when the latter discussed how the SGS system can help monitor leakages in trade and provide data analysis to increase trade revenues and opportunities for the Philippines. The Geneva-based SGS operates locally as SGS Philippines and has offices and laboratories across the country. Globally, the company has 97,000 employees in 2,650 offices and laboratories worldwide. Concepcion said SGS offered to inspect imported agricultural products to the Philippines at no cost to the government. He explained that the company plans on charging its fees to the exporters of agricultural products to the Philippines. “SGS’ offer is to inspect all agricultural products coming into the Philippines, and it will now be the exporters who will have to pay to send their agricultural products here,” Concepcion said. “The issue on agricultural smuggling is real, and I think any effort to help curb it is worth looking into,” he added. According to Go Negosyo, Bottomley emphasized the importance of ensuring the safety and quality of agricultural products in the country, as well as how SGS can assist farmers and agribusinesses by providing testing and certification services. He also affirmed the commitment of SGS to promote sustainable agriculture practices through its programs and initiatives. Concepcion said the proposal of SGS will be referred to the relevant public and private sector bodies, such as the Department of Agriculture and the Private Sector Advisory Council for agriculture. He emphasized that eradicating smuggling and undervaluation of agricultural goods complements efforts to help strengthen local agriculture. “It comes just in time as more companies have become interested in joining our KALAP initiative,” Concepcion said, referring to Go Negosyo’s Kapatid Angat Lahat Agri Program. Just recently, the country’s leading banks and financial institutions met with KALAP and expressed their support for its efforts to ease farmers’ access to credit. KALAP is an initiative of Go Negosyo to help the country’s small farmers integrate into the value chain of large companies. Its proponents have begun drafting its roadmap to implement inclusive business models for primary agricultural commodities in the country.",

In a statement on Tuesday, Concepcion said several expansion and export opportunities in Cambodia for Philippine companies were explored during the CEO Roundtable meeting held on the sidelines of the ASEAN Summit in Phnom Penh last week. He added that the meeting was able to identify areas of cooperation in agriculture, housing, digitalization, food security, hospitality, garments manufacturing, business process outsourcing and with micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) development as among the priority areas. The Go Negosyo founder noted that agriculture, in particular, was revealed as a promising area of cooperation between the two countries. He pointed out that Cambodia produces rice, but Vietnam – a major exporter of rice to the Philippines – has the biggest production by hectare. “Cambodia is a big exporter of rice, but it goes through Vietnam for processing,” Concepcion said. “Our suggestion is to import so that the Philippine companies can process the rice,” he added. Concepcion said Cambodian businessmen were receptive to the idea, and even offered technology exchange between the two countries. The CEO Roundtable meeting was the first engagement of President Marcos during the ASEAN Summits. The private meeting was attended by Cambodian and Philippine business leaders to connect and discuss opportunities for business exchange between the two economies. Also at the meeting were Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s George Barcelon, LT Group’s Michael Tan, Go Negosyo senior adviser Josephine Romero and the Philippine winners of the ASEAN Business Awards 2022. During the meeting, the Philippine group invited Cambodian businessmen to invest in the Philippines and partner with Philippine businesses. Several opportunities for business exchange emerged for both big and small businesses.

The additional cases brought the tally of injuries to 585, mostly due to fireworks. Of the total, there was one case of watusi ingestion and three stray bullet injuries. The two new cases of stray bullet injuries involved a 28-year-old male from Metro Manila who sustained a fracture in his toe, and a 60-year-old male from the Cordillera Administrative Region who suffered a fractured left collarbone. “Let us be reminded that injuries and deaths from stray bullets and “accidents” due to intoxication are avoidable. Guns, fireworks, and liquor should not mix,” the DOH said. According to the department, more than half, or 311, of injuries related to New Year festivities were from Metro Manila. The capital region was followed by Ilocos region (58), Calabarzon (47), and Central Luzon (42). Ninety-six percent of the injuries happened at home and on the streets, mostly by males who actively lit the fireworks. The most common culprits were kwitis, 5-star, whistle bomb, pla-pla, boga, luces, and foundation. “Illegal fireworks are to blame for just four out of 10 cases (220, 38%), with legal fireworks causing more injuries,” the DOH said.",

      "date_published": "2024-12-03T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus 3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) has cut its growth forecast for the Philippines to 5.8 percent for this year, but expects the economy to post faster growth next year, citing easing inflation and interest rates. In a statement yesterday, AMRO said it expects the Philippines to post gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 5.8 percent this year, lower than the 6.1 percent economic growth forecast provided by AMRO last October. AMRO’s new 2024 GDP forecast for the Philippines is also below the government’s six to seven percent growth goal for the year. For 2025, AMRO expects economic growth to accelerate to 6.3 percent. This forecast is also lower than the 6.5 to 7.5 percent growth the government is aiming for in 2025. “The Philippine economy is expected to strengthen further with easing inflation and a less restrictive monetary policy,” AMRO said. AMRO said it expects inflation to fall to 3.2 percent this year and to remain at this level in 2025 from last year’s six percent. Inflation accelerated to 2.3 percent in October from 1.9 percent in September amid faster upticks in food prices. This brought average inflation from January to October to 3.3 percent, within the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)’s two to four percent target band. The BSP delivered its first rate cut in August, followed by another 25-basis-point rate reduction in October, bringing the benchmark rate to six percent. Aside from slower inflation and lower interest rates, AMRO expects Philippine GDP growth to be supported by strong domestic demand and a pickup in external demand. Philippine economic growth slowed to 5.2 percent in the third quarter from the previous quarter’s 6.4-percent expansion and the six percent growth posted in the third quarter last year. From January to September, the economy grew by an average of 5.8 percent. Earlier, National Economic and Development Authority Secretary Arsenio Balisacan said the economy needs to grow by at least 6.5 percent in the fourth quarter to attain the six to seven percent growth goal for the year. The AMRO said risks to the country’s growth prospects include higher inflation that could dampen consumption, as well as a sharp slowdown in major trading partners. It said heightened geopolitical risks could also lead to supply disruptions and a resurgence of inflationary pressure. “The country’s long-term potential growth could be challenged by insufficient infrastructure investment, vulnerabilities to climate change and the prolonged scarring effects from the COVID-19 pandemic,” the AMRO said. To bolster the Philippines’ potential growth, AMRO recommends the implementation of measures to upskill and reskill the workforce and attract foreign direct investments, while encouraging technology transfer. “To lift growth potential, it is important to develop a comprehensive strategy to enhance productivity and competitiveness. This includes further infrastructure investment and continued development in digitalization as well as promoting a sustainable economy,” AMRO said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — In an effort to address vaccine hesitancy among the public, the Department of Health (DOH) has advised local officials to engage “influencers” in their campaign so as to convince unvaccinated members of the community to receive COVID-19 vaccines. In a recently released memorandum, the DOH said local officials should “ensure the presence of key influencers/champions in the barangay, highlighting the benefits of vaccination through the influencers’ testimonies.” An influencer is someone who is able to persuade a lot of other people or a target audience, according to a definition by Collins Dictionary. Influencers have the capability to convince individuals or groups into doing something. The DOH also recommended that local government units (LGUs) employ “small group discussions as these provide more personal messaging to address personal concerns.” “Coordinate with local leaders and community health workers to identify vaccine-hesitant individuals, and explore and address specific reasons behind the hesitation,” the agency’s memorandum instructed. The DOH recently announced that bivalent COVID-19 vaccines can now be given as first, second and third booster to the country’s priority groups – health care workers (A1), senior citizens (A2) and immunocompromised individuals (A3). Health Secretary Ted Herbosa said they decided to roll out these bivalent jabs to the A3 category to speed up the utilization of the 390,000 doses of the vaccines, which are set to expire on Aug. 30. The DOH stressed that to fast-track the COVID-19 vaccination program, LGUs should ensure placement of vaccination sites at strategic locations. The agency likewise noted a need to focus on the deployment of more vaccination teams to identified areas, including volunteers from medical societies, civil society organizations, private sectors and faith-based organizations. “Form more vaccination teams for mobile vaccination and temporary post-vaccination, as needed. Provide daily quota per vaccination team based on the target per barangay or catchment area,” the DOH said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The country’s agricultural output decreased at a slower pace in the third quarter. According to a report of the Philippine Statistics Authority on Wednesday, agriculture and fisheries production have shrunk by -0.3%. Livestock and poultry production, meanwhile, grew at 2.5% and 2.9% in the third quarter, respectively, helping offset the 0.4% and 6.1% contraction in crops and fisheries production. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) stated that it was ready to implement additional policy measures as needed to stabilize inflation expectations due to a significant upside risk to its inflation forecast until 2025. On October 26, the BSP had recently raised interest rates by 25 basis points outside the regular schedule expressing concerns about the potential for uncontrolled inflation. The year-to-date average inflation of 6.4% continued to exceed the central bank's comfortable range of 2% to 4%. The BSP also reported that 2.26 million Filipinos were unemployed in September which is higher than August’s 2.21 million. Be The First To React How Do You Feel About This Article?

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Impeachment complaints filed against Vice President Sara Duterte will likely get the support or one-third of the House of Representatives, according to Manila Rep. Bienvenido Abante Jr. “But we don’t know if it will succeed in the Senate,” Abante told Teleradyo Serbisyo. Congressmen are still “blind” to the impeachment process against Duterte “because nobody is moving,” he said. “There is no movement although three impeachment complaints have already been filed,” he said. Duterte’s impeachment might proceed depending on the actions of congressmen, some of whom were still on vacation as of yesterday, he noted. Only one-third of House members are needed for a resolution to get approved and set into motion the articles of impeachment, according to Abante, vice chairman of House committee on good government and public accountability. He admitted the campaign period for the mid-term elections might set back impeachment proceedings. Congressmen do not want to fast track the impeachment process so that it can stand once it is forwarded to the Senate, he said. Consolidation of the impeachment complaints filed by members of the Akbayan, Makabayan and a group of lawyers and priests will depend on the House justice committee’s decision. Abante also sees no problem with former president Rodrigo Duterte acting as a lawyer for his daughter in the impeachment complaints filed against her. The House quad committee, he stressed, will continue probing Philippine offshore gaming operators and extrajudicial killings during the previous Duterte administration. The quad committee, composed of four House panels, earlier recommended the filing of crimes against humanity charges against Duterte, Senators Bong Go and Ronald Dela Rosa and other police officials for reported extrajudicial killings during Duterte’s term. “Next to that is asking victims’ relatives to show up. This is not only about the war on drugs. This includes even those so-called human rights defenders who do not have any involvement in the armed struggle. They are also complaining because they are not NPA (New People’s Army), they were just mistakenly included,” Abante said. Many members of the media, lawyers and doctors were also killed during the Duterte administration, he Abante said. “They were killed. They claimed they are carrying firearms, when in fact, they don’t have. They are not even members of the CPP (Communist Party of the Philippines)-NPA,” he said. The quad comm, led by Rep. Robert Ace Barbers, also wants to probe the death of Albuera, Leyte mayor Rolando Espinosa, Abante said. Espinosa was killed inside his cell at the Baybay City provincial jail on Nov. 5, 2016. He was among the politicians linked by Duterte to the illegal drug trade.",

The department is eyeing to repatriate all 114 individuals by the second week of August. \"The DFA continues to assist all distressed Filipinos overseas, including undocumented contract workers,\" Foreign Affairs Acting Undersecretary Eduardo Jose de Vega said in a statement on Sunday.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To restore people’s confidence in the Commission on Elections (Comelec), President Marcos was asked yesterday to appoint two new poll commissioners from the opposition. Veteran election lawyer Romulo Macalintal stressed the “urgent need” to appoint commissioners nominated by opposition parties following the recent Supreme Court rulings against the Comelec. Macalintal said the current Comelec has repeatedly committed grave abusive acts by failing to observe the basic constitutional rights to due process and equal protection laws. “Thus, because of this development, we cannot blame the stakeholders in the forthcoming 2025 elections to feel wary, especially the candidates and the law profession, of the independence, integrity, and competence of the officials who will conduct the said elections,” Macalintal said in a statement. He said the people must be fully informed of why and how much alleged abusive acts are committed by the Comelec in rendering decisions. “And this could only be done and insured with a Comelec commissioner recommended by the opposition who could be their voice to be insured of an independent and impartial Comelec,” he added. In 1984, Macalintal said, the late former president Ferdinand Marcos Sr. appointed congressman Ramon Felipe as poll commissioner as recommended by the opposition. Felipe eventually became Comelec chief after the 1986 revolution. Macalintal said there are many young and competent practicing election lawyers who could be appointed as poll commissioners and decide cases with integrity and honesty. Comelec Commissioners Socorro Inting and Marlon Casquejo are set to retire this week.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Health (DOH) yesterday clarified that not all of the P7.4 billion worth of drugs tagged by the Commission on Audit (COA) have expired. “Only 0.03 percent were found to have actually expired while only 1.16 percent are near expiry,” the DOH reported. Most of the expired medicines, DOH said, are stocks in government-run hospitals, which were unutilized due to the lower number of patients going to hospitals fearing COVID-19, while the rest were in DOH regional offices, which remained undistributed due to refusal to accept new stocks, citing sufficiency of existing inventory. The DOH explained that the COA findings focused on the proper disposal of expired drugs and medicines and not on expiration per se, noting that the concerned hospitals and health facilities were able to justify the causes of the expiration, but those were not highlighted in the audit. Some 95.81 percent of the cited amount is not expired and only pertains to slow moving, undistributed or overstocked inventories, the DOH said. Concerning the slow-moving inventories, DOH said that 86 percent have been distributed to centers for health development and other health facilities. The remaining 14 percent of the inventories tagged as slow-moving/undistributed/overstocked are scheduled to be delivered in the last quarter of 2023. Health Secretary Ted Herbosa previously ordered the creation of an asset management task force in the DOH to ensure that issues like these are planned for, immediately addressed and prevented. Bivalent doses Over 13,000 doses of bivalent COVID-19 vaccines are still available for eligible population, the DOH said. As of Sept. 8, DOH said, a total of 13,394 bivalent doses are yet to be used. About half of the remaining doses are allocated in the Bicol region (2,607), Calabarzon (2,354) and Mimaropa (2,223). The Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao still has 1,630 doses while the National Capital Region has 1,137. Of the 388,980 bivalent vaccines donated by the Lithuanian government, 366,561 doses have been used. “(This) accounts for 94.23 percent of the allocated vaccines from the Lithuanian government,” the DOH noted.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — To monitor and track sex offenders in the community, Sen. Jinggoy Estrada is proposing the establishment of a national database of sex offenders that is easily available and accessible to local law enforcement agencies and their foreign counterparts. “The many special penal laws against sex-related offenses so enacted of late shall be futile unless ample public protection and warning is provided for,” Estrada said in explaining the necessity of Senate Bill 1291, the proposed “National Sex Offender Registry Act.” It is unfortunate, he said, that a number of sex offenders who have been apprehended and convicted are still able to consummate their fiendish schemes against unsuspecting victims by relocating elsewhere. Estrada explained that the measure aims to establish a national sex offender registration database that may be of use not only to the general public but also to various non-government organizations working for the protection of women and children who more often than not are the target victims of sex-related offenses. The National Sex Offender Registry Database proposed to be set up and handled by the Department of Justice (DOJ) shall contain the names and other pertinent details of sex offenders who reside or travel to the country. It will be available and accessible to the Philippine National Police (PNP), National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) and concerned law enforcement agencies. It can be shared between countries and respective law enforcement agencies if deemed necessary for the proper registration and identification of sex offenders. Under the bill, convicted sex offenders, prior to being released from imprisonment, shall register and regularly update the province, city, or municipality where they are residing, employed, or studying. They have 10 days to update their registration if there are changes in their address, employment, or school. Failure to do so will be penalized with one to five years of imprisonment and fined P10,000. Those convicted in local and foreign courts shall remain in the registry for life and will be required to appear at least once a year before the local police in their place of residence to personally verify their information.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Murder charges have been filed against expelled congressman Arnolfo Teves Jr. over the March 4 assassination of Negros Oriental governor Roel Degamo, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ). State prosecutors filed charges of murder, frustrated murder and attempted murder against Teves before a Manila court on Aug. 18, DOJ spokesman Mico Clavano said at a forum over the weekend. Other murder charges have likewise been filed against Teves over the killing of three persons in Negros Oriental in 2019. These were filed in Bayawan City in Negros but the DOJ is asking for their transfer to Manila. “We want the venue of the trial on neutral ground, and it will all be done here,” Clavano said in Filipino. He said the DOJ hopes that the courts will issue an arrest warrant on the former Negros Oriental lawmaker “in the next few days.” The killing of Degamo took place in his residential compound in Pamplona while he was distributing aid. Nine other people were killed in the attack. Ten suspects are currently in the custody of the authorities, while one had been killed in an encounter with security forces. One of the suspects named a certain “Cong. Teves” as the person behind the attack against Degamo. In April, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said Teves appeared to be the “main mastermind” in the killing of Degamo, likening him to an “executive producer of a movie.” He has also dubbed Marvin Miranda, one of the alleged masterminds in the case, as a “director or casting director.” In May, Remulla said Teves was in Timor-Leste to seek asylum. According to the Department of Foreign Affairs, Teves’ application was denied. In August, the Anti-Terrorism Council designated Teves and 12 others as terrorists, citing several alleged killings and harassment in Negros Oriental. According to Clavano, the designation as a terrorist was meant to “clip Teves’ wings and limit his financial capacity and financial transactions” as it would mean freezing the former lawmakers’ assets. Teves was expelled on Aug. 16 from the House of Representatives for disorderly conduct and his continued absence despite an expired travel authority. The former lawmaker earlier said he is not inclined to go home yet due to fears over his safety. He has also appealed to authorities for fairness and asked them to look at all angles in the killing of Degamo. When sought for comment, Teves’ lawyer Ferdinand Topacio said he has not yet read the DOJ resolution indicting his client. “May I reserve my comment until I’ve read it?” he said in a text message.",

      "date_published": "2024-12-19T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) is standing pat on its decision to ban the importation of buffalo meat from three Indian states, citing the need to protect local livestock population against foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Agriculture Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said he has already responded to the appeal made by Philippine Association of Meat Processors Inc. (PAMPI) regarding the ban imposed on imports of Indian buffalo meat (IBM) from the states of Bihar, Maharashtra and Telangana. Tiu Laurel said he could not lift the import ban since the presence of FMD in the three states were confirmed by the DA inspection mission (DAIM) as well as by the Indian government itself through an official document. “The suppliers in the three areas knew that there was an FMD there already and yet they did not tell us. If they (PAMPI) can get a document that says that these areas are FMD-free then we can lift [the ban],” he said. The agriculture chief said 18 percent of the samples taken by the DAIM in the three states tested positive with FMD. PAMPI earlier appealed to Tiu Laurel to reconsider the ban imposed on the three Indian states, claiming that it would cause supply disruptions to the industry by the first quarter of next year. PAMPI argued that there has been no reported case of transmission of the FMD virus from the imported Indian buffalo meat in the past 30 years because both DA-accredited suppliers and local meat processors strictly comply with the guidelines set by the World Organization for Animal Health. The group added that meat processors have been implementing the necessary protocols in inactivating FMD virus should they be found present in the raw materials they sourced. The group also argued that the DA should also ban the importation of IBM from the state of Uttar Pradesh, citing the presence of FMD based on reports of International Society for Infectious Diseases and mainstream media in India. However, Tiu Laurel explained that the DAIM did not find the existence of FMD in Uttar Pradesh, hence, there is no basis to ban IBM imports from the Indian state. The Indian government also did not officially report to the Philippines that there is FMD in Uttar Pradesh, he added. “I told them why not just buy from the new accredited plants? Why are you pushing for banned plants and areas? Why are you pushing me to allow areas proven to have FMD as tested by the Indian government,” he recalled telling a PAMPI representative. The DA has expanded the number of accredited foreign meat establishments (FMEs) in India allowed to export IBM to the Philippines to 34 from the previously just six FMEs. However, 13 of the accredited FMEs will not be able to immediately export carabeef to the Philippines since they are located in the three Indian states with FMD. According to Tiu Laurel, he would allow the importation of boiled carabeef from the FMEs in the FMD-affected Indian states if they have the capacity to do so. “If they can do that, I will allow it,” he said, citing the case of Pakistan exporting boiled carabeef to China. Tiu Laurel explained that the expansion of accredited FMEs to export IBM to the Philippines is meant to increase competition in the domestic market with the goal of driving down costs of imported meat products.",

      "date_published": "2023-02-25T09:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The plan of the Bureau of Corrections (BuCor) to build its headquarters in an environmental reserve in Tanay, Rizal is set to be probed by the Senate committee on tourism. The inquiry was prompted by a resolution filed by the committee chair, Sen. Nancy Binay, who cited the warning of the Masungi Georeserve Foundation that the BuCor’s plan would have an adverse impact on the environment and the tourism industry. “The Masungi Georeserve is a conservation area and a rustic rock garden tucked in the rainforests of Rizal. Masungi’s name is derived from the word ‘masungki,’ which translates to ‘spiked’ – an apt description for the sprawling limestone landscape found within,” Binay said in her Senate Resolution 495. “The Masungi Georeserve is a symbol of sustainable development and at the forefront of efforts to conserve, restore and improve the environment in the face of climate change, which must be protected by the government and private sector at all costs,” she said. “While the initiatives of the BuCor to have a new headquarters and housing for its personnel are reasonable, it is important to weigh the possible consequences of building its headquarters in an ecotourism site like the Masungi Georeserve, which may affect the environment and tourism in the country,” she added. Binay cited news reports quoting acting BuCor Director General Gregorio Catapang Jr. as having claimed that the bureau is the owner of the 270-hectare land in Tanay where its headquarters and residential sites for personnel will be put up. This claim, however, is strongly being contested by the foundation. She noted that in 2019, the Masungi Georeserve received international recognition for its sustainable tourism practices at the annual World Tourism Organization Awards. Ann Dumaliang, co-founder of the Masungi Georeserve, said the site being eyed as a relocation site is home to fragile limestone formations and included in conservation efforts under the Masungi Geopark Project between the Masungi Georeserve Foundation and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, through a valid and binding memorandum of agreement signed by then environment secretary Gina Lopez in 2017. Binay also said scientists of the National Museum of the Philippines warned that developing the relocation site will have dire consequences for the environment.",

      "article_headline": "More cold storage facilities needed – PCAFI",
      "date_published": "2022-12-27T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — More investments in cold storage facilities for the agriculture sector are needed next year to reduce post-harvest losses and improve farmers’ income, the Philippine Chamber of Agriculture and Food Inc. (PCAFI) said. PCAFI president Danilo Fausto said the lack of cold storage facilities remains a big problem in the country. In 2020, the Department of Agriculture (DA) already underscored the need to establish more cold storage facilities in the country. Two years after, the Philippines is still lacking in terms of storage facilities and other infrastructure, resulting in high spoilage of farm produce. As an example, Nueva Ecija only has 10 cold storage facilities; Bulacan has eight; the National Capital Region has 27; Pangasinan has two and Occidental Mindoro has two as of September 2021. These facilities are still enough to store agricultural products, Fausto said. “The idea is to build more cold storage facilities for bumper harvests. Cold storage facilities are dual purpose…it can be a freezer or a chiller,” he said. The PCAFI official said there are pre-fabricated cold storage facilities which can be put up in a short time. With cold storage facilities, the sector can maintain the freshness and quality of farm and fishery products, especially for bumper harvest, leading to reduced importation. “If you have the bumper harvest…you don’t need to import. With bumper harvests, we will have more or less some surplus,” Fausto said. Onions, for example, had a shortage of supply as early as July. Prices of red onions skyrocketed to as high as P300 per kilo. “We have failed to import something like 40,000 to 50,000 so we are short of supply,” Fausto said. The DA earlier considered importing onions this month, but sidetracked this option as it expects some early onion harvest this month while full-blown harvest is seen by February. With harvests coming in soon, Fausto said it was the right move to not import onions. “It’s now too late to import. The importation should go sometime about July or August,” he said. The PCAFI official also expects a lot of harvest from January to March, filling up cold storage facilities. “By April, we might see onions being thrown away because storage is no longer available. So, the idea is to put up cold storage facilities,” Fausto said.",

      "date_published": "2023-07-26T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — A “videoke” session by several police officers as protesters were holding demonstrations along Commonwealth Avenue during President Marcos’ State of the Nation Address (SONA) was not meant to bully anyone, National Capital Region Police Office (NCRPO) chief Brig. Gen. Jose Melencio Nartatez Jr. said on Monday. He issued the statement when a video of the session went viral and was described by Rachell Villamor, who uploaded the video on Twitter, as “very disrespectful.” Villamor said the police officers’ singing drowned out the voices of Southern Luzon farmers and youth as they were holding a protest to air their concerns to the government. “Instead of hearing the pleas of the activists, the (Quezon City Police District or QCPD) was having a videoke to drown out the program,” Villamor said. Nartatez said he did not see anything wrong with what the police officers did and it was not meant to bully the activists. “It is for morale boosting for our personnel,” he said in an interview after the SONA. Quezon City Mayor Joy Belmonte said the city government launched an investigation and found that the police officers seen singing in the video were not from the QCPD but from the NCRPO. This prompted the city government to relay the concern instead to the Philippine National Police so that activists will be able to “peacefully and freely convey their concerns.” QCPD director Nicolas Torre III belied Villamor’s claims, saying the patrol vehicle in the video was far from the site of the protest. He cited a screenshot of a closed-circuit television footage that showed the location of the patrol vehicle and the stage where the protest rally was being held. “I am sure that you couldn’t hear the singing because the stage was far from the noise in Philcoa. You are a liar as well as your peers,” he said in a Facebook post on Monday.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Laguindingan International Airport will soon be seeing upgrades after the government signed a P12.75 billion project with Aboitiz InfraCapital Inc. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. oversaw the signing of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) project concession at Malacañan Palace on Monday, October 28. “With the influx of travelers in the Mindanao Region, the signing of this Concession Agreement for the Laguindingan International Airport – Public-Private Partnership Project provides us with the opportunity to expand the facilities, upgrade the terminals, augment capacity, and deliver our services in a safer, efficient and more convenient way,” Marcos said at the signing. The Laguindingan International Airport in Northern Mindanao is the gateway to many key places on the southern island. “This vision can only be realized through our united efforts and steadfast commitment to work together, to work hand in hand. With that, this Administration extends our gratitude to the supportive and visionary partners in the private sector, particularly, Aboitiz InfraCapital Inc.,” Marcos said. Marcos said that the upgrade of the airport will improve its capacity first, from 3.9 million passengers to 6.3 million. He also promised improved tourism, job creation, business presence and economic growth. “To the officials and employees of the Department of Transportation, Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines, the Public-Private Partnership Center, and all concerned agencies, I urge you to remain on track in completing and implementing transportation projects,” Marcos said. Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista said that Aboitiz will now take over Laguinduingan Airport’s operations and maintenance for over 30 years. The Department of Transportation said that some of Aboitiz’s responsibilities include reconfiguring terminal space, as well as the construction of the new Passenger Terminal Building.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is set to release on Dec. 4 the list of Philippine products and services to be given preference in government procurement as part of the Tatak Pinoy Act. During the Kapihan sa Manila Bay on Wednesday, Ma.Theresa Faustino, officer-in-charge director of DTIs Bureau of Policy Research and Innovation, said the DTI would release the list during the Tatak Pinoy Summit to be held on Dec. 4. During the summit, she said the DTI would announce all projects and activities undertaken since the signing of the Tatak Pinoy (Proudly Filipino) Act or Republic Act 11981, last Feb. 26. We will be launching or announcing the partial list of products and services that will be given preference in terms of government procurement, Faustino said. The issuance of the list of products to be given preference in government procurement forms part of the Tatak Pinoy Act to strengthen the domestic industry. The law seeks to encourage the production of globally competitive Philippine products and services. Faustino said the list to be released next month, would continue to be updated as the DTI obtains data. “We cannot determine (everything) in a short period of time. It is not cast in stone. So it is a live list, active list. We will be improving on it based on what we get from data,” she said. She said the list will include cement. Aside from the partial list of products and services given preference, she said the DTI would also be presenting the draft of the multi-year Tatak Pinoy strategy, which will include all plans, programs and activities to be undertaken under the Tatak Pinoy Act. The strategy includes inputs from consultations conducted with the different industries. “We will be presenting the framework for development, issues, constraints experienced by industries and proposed solutions,” Faustino said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Health Secretary Teodoro Herbosa yesterday urged the Civil Service Commission (CSC) to review the requirements being asked of clinical psychologists and psychiatrists in order to practice their profession. At the launch of the “Philippine Council for Mental Health (PCMH) Strategic Framework” at the Rizal Park Hotel in Manila, Herbosa said much is asked of psychologists and psychiatrists who are only assigned salary grade 11. “The problem in (the field of) psychology in government is that there is a need for a master’s degree but is only assigned salary grade 11,” said the Department of Health (DOH) chief. The official stressed that a higher salary should be given psychologists. He added, “How can we encourage applicants for guidance counselor items if that is the case. I’m calling the CSC to change that.” The official cited as an example nurses who are assigned salary grade 15. “They don’t have master’s degree yet, but they are assigned salary grade 15. That should also be (salary grade) 15 or even higher (for psychologists).” In partnership with the World Health Organization (WHO), the DOH yesterday launched the PCMH Strategic Framework to guide the development and implementation of mental health policies, programs and services to address the significant burden of mental illness and improve mental health and well-being in the country. The five-year strategic plan aims to reduce premature mortality, prevent and treat substance abuse effectively, and reduce the vulnerability of individuals and communities to mental, neurological and substance use disorders. “Today, as we launch the 2024-2028 PCMH Strategic Framework, I am confident that we can address more mental health concerns in the country,” said Herbosa. “We commit to implementing pro-equity strategies to ensure access to universal health care and develop resilient health systems in the country that respond to the mental health and well-being needs of every citizen,” WHO Representative to the Philippines Dr. Rui Paulo de Jesus said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Children ages one to four years old can now register with the Philippine Identification System (PhilSys) for the national ID. In a statement, the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) said the rollout of this service is part of its efforts to get more Filipinos to register with the PhilSys, including minors. To register, a parent or guardian who is already PhilSys-registered will need to be present. The child’s PhilSys number or permanent identification number will be linked to the accompanying parent or guardian. For the registration, the PSA said the accompanying parent or guardian will need to present supporting documents to validate the child’s demographic information. Any of the following supporting documents may be presented: certificate of live birth issued by the PSA or the Local Civil Registry Office; report of birth issued by the PSA or Philippine Foreign Service Post; certificate of foundling issued by the PSA, and certificate of foundling or certificate of live birth or persons with no known parent/s issued by the PSA. Parents or guardians may also present the child’s municipal form 102; Philippine passport or ePassport issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs; or any document showing the full name of the child, date and place of birth, the full name of the mother and the full name of the father, if acknowledged. Upon validation of demographic information, a front-facing photograph of the child will be taken. Other biometric information including the fingerprints, iris scan and the updated front-facing photograph will be captured after the child reaches the age of five. “We encourage parents and guardians to join us in taking the step towards a new Philippines for the next generation by registering their children ages one to four to PhilSys,” PSA Undersecretary Dennis Mapa said. The PSA said PhilSys registration activities continue to be implemented across the country. Registration centers remain open to walk-in registrations, while mobile registration activities are also being conducted for those residing in geographically isolated and disadvantaged areas or have no means to visit any registration centers.",

      "article_body": "The British Chamber of Commerce Philippines (BCCP) ended 2024 on a positive note–citing the passage of its priority legislation covering areas on agriculture, financial services, and tax reforms. For 2025, the British Chamber remains optimistic and identifies remaining key priority legislation including the Cybersecurity Act, E- Governance Act, and Open Access in Data Transmission Act. BCCP Executive Director/Trustee Chris Nelson during the SGV Tax Symposium commended the key developments presented by the officials from various government agencies such as the Anti-Red Tape Authority, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA), Bureau of Customs (BOC), Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR), and Sen. Win Gatchalian. In an interview, Nelson noted that, “It is very important that government agencies are looking into various areas and actions to take. Hopefully, the recommendations materialize and convince more British investors to put their money here…” Taking advantage of UK excellence in various areas including cybersecurity and effective regulatory practices, the British Chamber consistently supports the passage of the Cybersecurity Act to further strengthen the cybersecurity posture and combat cyberthreats to increase investor confidence in the Philippines. Nelson further noted the presence of UK cybersecurity companies, two of which are its Members such as CyberQ Group and NCC Group. Meanwhile, the E-Governance Act will further improve the country’s connectivity through digitalization to provide an efficient and institutionalized approach. In 2024, the British Chamber has been actively involved in working with ARTA and has officially become an ARTA Champion, allowing them to directly receive complaints from its Members to effectively address the concerns on red tape and reduce bureaucracies. Moreover, the Konektadong Pinoy Act aims to provide a competitive telecommunications sector, transcending growth across different sectors including agriculture, education, and health as noted by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). Despite developments, Nelson reiterated the importance of reinforcing the market opportunities in the Philippines to effectively compete with its neighboring countries. Nelson further added that, “The Philippines has great opportunities, its population growth is young and dynamic. The UK is looking at infrastructure, green energy, services, and food and beverage and we need to keep stressing the benefits of coming here. We are very optimistic but we have to keep working hard.”",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The government will build more world-class infrastructure in other growth areas in the country to maximize their potential and attract investments, President Marcos pledged on Wednesday as he led the inspection of the 19.81-kilometer Airport to New Clark City Access Road (ANAR) in Mabalacat, Pampanga. The completion of ANAR will not only reduce travel time from Clark International Airport to New Clark City from one hour to 20 minutes but will also pave the way for more tourists and investments in the province, according to Marcos. “This road is much more than just an access road. It is part of our plan to propel Clark as an alternate growth area. It is a red carpet rolled out to those who will partake of all the best things that Clark can offer,” the President said. “It shows the path forward, of Building Better More so we will never lose our competitive advantage because unlocking the full potential of Clark is a continuing task,” he added. The project will also save commuters’ money as it will remain toll free, the President said. Marcos directed the Bases Conversion and Development Authority to ensure the timely completion of the remaining works for the six-lane highway. As of Feb. 14, the access road is 95.21 percent complete. All remaining works is expected to be completed by June 24. Marcos underscored that his administration is not only transforming Clark’s physical capital, but is also upskilling its manpower. Clark has a lot of potential as it can host various economic activities including innovation labs, creative workshops, manufacturing concerns, leisure complexes and cyber corridor, Marcos said. The new Clark International Airport, he noted, has earned international recognition and was hailed by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Prix Versailles as one of the most beautiful airports in the world.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Mindanao-wide resilient infrastructure programs will be expedited amid recent disasters in the region, according to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR). President Marcos ordered the DENR and the Department of Public Works and Highways to expedite the programs, Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said over the weekend. Marcos also wants local communities to directly benefit from the implementation of the National Adaptation Plan, she added. The impact of temperature increases, rainfall changes, sea level rise and typhoons could increase to P1.4 trillion in 2030 or around eight percent of the 2020 gross domestic product (GDP), Loyzaga noted. “Our goal is to build transformative climate resilience, minimize losses and damage and achieve sustainable socio-economic development by 2050. The strategies and outcomes address impacts specifically on food security, water resources, health, ecosystems and biodiversity, population migration and the preservation of cultural heritage,” she said. The World Bank estimated the country was losing up to 1.2 percent of GDP annually in the last decade beginning in 2011 due to the rapid onset of typhoons alone, she added. “This figure did not include the impacts of prolonged periods of drought, which we considered slow onset disasters especially during El Niño years, and the impacts of extreme rainfall events on lives, livelihoods and infrastructure,” she said. The country also needs to make adaptation and disaster risk reduction priorities, she noted. “We are hosting the Asia-Pacific Ministerial Conference this year – a golden opportunity to learn and do more. We urge you to adopt your host ecosystems and communities beyond your fence lines, as stewards and partners,” Loyzaga said.",

      "date_published": "2024-01-11T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) expects the country’s total exports to grow by 10 percent this year. In an interview with reporters, DTI-Export Marketing Bureau director Bianca Sykimte said that based on market projections, if everything is business as usual, the country’s exports are expected to grow by 10 percent this year. “So definitely, we’ll try to achieve more than 10 percent for export growth,”she said. Nevertheless, Sykimte emphasized that in order to meet the export targets outlined in the Philippine Export Development Plan (PEDP 2023-2028) for this year, the country requires a 40 percent growth in exports. “For us to be able to catch up with our PEDP targets, we need to grow by about 40 percent this year because we did not meet the target for 2023,” Sykimte said. Based on the PEDP, the Philippines was targeting export revenues of $126.8 billion last year. Both the DTI and industry stakeholders earlier said that this target would likely be missed. Latest data from the Philippine Statistics Authority (PSA) showed that merchandise exports from January to November 2023 reached $67.03 billion, an 8.4 percent decline from the $73.18 billion registered in the same period in 2022. Service exports from January to September 2023, on the other hand, grew by 20.7 percent to $34.7 billion, according to data from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). Under the PEDP, the Philippines is targeting export revenues of $143.4 billion this year. “It’s a bit difficult, but we really need to attract investment sto build our domestic capacities,” Sykimte said. Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual explained that part of the DTI’s strategy of increasing exports is to bring foreign manufacturers, export-oriented foreign manufacturers, to locate in the Philippines.",

      "date_published": "2023-06-08T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Agriculture (DA) has partnered with the municipalities of Dinalupihan and Hermosa, and the Bataan Peninsula State University (BPSU) to pilot zero-kilometer or “0 KM” food project in the province. In a statement yesterday, the DA recently signed a memorandum of agreement (MOA) with the municipalities of Dinalupihan and Hermosa, and the BPSU to ensure that the targets of the 0 KM project will be met. The agency said 0 KM promotes healthy eating while minimizing the cost and environmental impact of transporting the products. It supports the use and consumption of locally grown fruits, vegetables, and other non-industrially produced food products that have not traveled far, or more literally that the food has traveled “zero kilometers” before being eaten. DA Senior Undersecretary Domingo Panganiban said the initiative forms part of the commitment of President Marcos toward a food-secure nation. “This program started with our President in his SONA (State of the Nation Address) where he said that it is necessary to complete the value chain of the products we import or buy, but that is not happening because of many obstacles in the municipalities on the way to markets, especially in Metro Manila,” he said. Under the MOA, the DA, through Bureau of Agricultural Research (BAR), will provide funding for a research that will examine the factors influencing supply and demand in the two municipalities. This includes commodity prices and expenditure movements by identifying the major stakeholders in the market economy and analyzing consumer behavior. “We, at DA-BAR, support studies and projects like this, because with the 0 km project, we are hitting three important goals: help promote income from local production, reduce marketing cost for increased income for producers and with less pollution from transporting goods, we save our environment – all these towards a healthier and food securer nation,” BAR assistant director Joell Lales said. Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI) and National Program Director of the High Value Crops and Development Program (HVCDP) director Gerald Glenn Panganiban said this is the outcome of the lessons learned from the difficulties that the HVCDP previously faced. The DA established a National Technical Working Group under Special Order No. 437, which was approved last April. The agency said the project aims to develop the food demand and supply structure of the Municipalities of Hermosa and Dinalupihan, Bataan, towards the end goal of sustainable and stable local food production and consumption of locally produced high-value crops and other agricultural commodities.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — As part of the fruit deal with China clinched by President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. in January, the Philippines shipped the first batch of durian to China on Thursday, according to the Department of Agriculture. In a news release, the DA said the shipment of 28 tons of durian -- weighing approximately 28,000 kilograms -- was sourced from producers and processors in Mindanao. Exports of durian to China are among the many fruit export plans under the $2 billion bilateral agreement that Marcos signed during his state visit to China in January. The deal also covers the shipment of other agricultural products, like coconut and bananas, among others, according to state news outfit Philippine News Agency. During the same visit to China, the DA and customs administration of China signed an agreement for the protocol of phytosanitary requirements – a measure that certifies crops have been inspected – for the export of fresh durians from the Philippines to China. Five packaging facilities and 58 durian farms have been greenlighted by the Chinese government for the shipment of durian, according to the news release. The DA also said on Saturday that an additional consignment of durians weighing 28 tons was sent through airfreight, while 10 container vans with a combined weight of 7.2 tons were transported by sea. “The deal is expected to gain $260 million or P14.3 billion in revenue for the local durian industry,” the department added. Marcos told business leaders in January that durian growers from Davao -- which produces around 78% of durian in the country -- were ready to meet the demand of the Chinese market for the fruit, according to a PNA news report.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang has submitted the ad interim appointment papers of newly designated Transportation Secretary Vince Dizon and Presidential Communications Office (PCO) Secretary Jay Ruiz to the Commission on Appointments (CA) for confirmation. The CA, however, could not act on the nominations of Dizon and Ruiz as Congress went on recess on Feb. 7 to give way to the campaign for the midterm elections. Session resumes on June 2. The 19th Congress will have only two weeks or six session days from June 2 to 13 before adjourning sine die. CA assistant minority leader and Surigao del Sur Rep. Johnny Pimentel announced that the commission received the papers of two newly appointed Cabinet members of President Marcos. “We have already received Secretary Dizon’s papers as well as those of newly appointed PCO Secretary Ruiz,” Pimentel said. Pimentel said that under the 1987 Constitution, Malacañang may issue key ad interim appointments while Congress is not in session. Pimentel, however, noted that ad interim appointments become invalid if disapproved by the CA or if left unconfirmed by the time Congress adjourns. Marcos appointed Dizon as DOTr secretary on Feb. 21, and the CA received his appointment papers on Feb. 24. Dizon succeeded Jaime Bautista, who stepped down from his post due to health reasons. Previously, Dizon served as presidential adviser on flagship programs and projects and as president of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) during the Duterte administration. Ruiz was appointed head of the PCO on Feb. 24, and the CA received his appointment papers on Feb. 25. Along with Dizon and Ruiz, Pimentel confirmed that the CA has received the appointment papers of four new constitutional commissioners: Noli Pipo and Maria Norina Tangaro-Casingal of the Commission on Elections, Luis Meinrado Pañgulayan of the Civil Service Commission and Douglas Michael Mallillin of the Commission on Audit. All four commissioners were appointed on Feb. 10. The CA received their appointment papers on the same day.",

      "date_published": "2022-11-06T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — E-commerce plays an important role in the country’s economic development, according to Trade Secretary Alfredo Pascual. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI), in partnership with the Philippine Bar Association, held on Friday the first e-commerce congress, which aims to promote a robust e-commerce environment in the Philippines. “We have all the ingredients – the economic assets – to make this happen: a young and digital native population, a growing middle class, available and affordable technologies and significant surpluses in the financial sector,” Pascual said. “E-commerce is one of the most potent tools and fastest routes in unlocking these economic assets toward sustained accelerated economic development,” he added. The event aims to promote a robust e-commerce environment in the Philippines, where online businesses, especially small ones, can develop and compete globally. Based on Google Temasek Bain’s e-Conomy SEA 2022 report, the Philippines’ internet economy continues its upward trend, growing by 20 percent to $20 billion this year from a year ago with e-commerce propelling it to $35 billion by 2025. According to the DTI, the number of businesses on retail sales via the internet has increased, while there has also been an increase in the number of consumer complaints against online sellers. Due to this, the DTI said the time is ripe for a new, relevant, and responsive e-commerce Law. Last year, DTI launched the e-commerce Philippines 2022 roadmap to employ government strategies that will speed up and broaden internet transactions by improving the digital infrastructure. “The current administration is bent on working on and enhancing this agenda to increase the contribution of eCommerce to the Philippine economy with the development of the eCommerce Philippines 2023-2025 Roadmap,” the DTI said. Meanwhile, Pascual pointed out that there are new laws and regulations related to e- commerce that are currently being drafted, such as on privacy, digital taxation, the gig economy, and pivoting to a cash-light society. “I hope that there will be productive dialogues in these areas because we urgently need to develop and improve our policies to create an enabling regulatory environment for e-commerce to grow,” he said. The e-commerce congress brought together government officials, members of the business sector, civil society organizations, and other stakeholders to pursue the overarching goal of strengthening eCommerce industry in the country. The e-commerce congress tackled the Internet Transactions bill, which aims to harness the overwhelming potential of the e-commerce market.",

KOICA Philippines said in a social media post that its assistant country director Lee Hyung-won visited the JICA Philippines office on Oct. 19 to discuss potential cooperation in the health sector. During the visit, the agencies exchanged information on their programs, particularly projects in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). KOICA said it “looks forward to strengthen its partnership with JICA to maximize effectiveness of support to the Philippines.” Last Sept. 21, JICA Philippines chief representative Sakamoto Takema and his delegation visited KOICA Philippines to explore how the two agencies can collaborate on common areas of interest. In that meeting, both agencies shared information on their respective official development assistance (ODA) programs. The agencies also discussed ways to enhance development cooperation in the Philippines. KOICA Philippines country director Kim Eunsub assured JICA of KOICA’s full support for future development initiatives. The National Economic and Development Authority’s 2022 ODA portfolio review report showed foreign aid from South Korea reached $910 million or 2.81 percent of the Philippines’ total active ODA last year. Meanwhile, ODA from Japan reached $9.96 billion or 30.75 percent of the total foreign aid secured by the Philippines in 2022.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Arsenio Balisacan has doused speculation that he is being tapped to replace President Marcos as secretary of agriculture. “No such offer,” Balisacan told The STAR in a text message yesterday when asked if he was being recruited as secretary of the Department of Agriculture (DA). There have been speculative reports in recent days that Balisacan, an agricultural economist, was being eyed to take over from Marcos as DA chief. As head of the National Economic and Development Authority, Balisacan is part of the government’s team of economic managers. The head of the team, Finance Secretary Benjamin Diokno, described as a “sound proposal” the appointment of Balisacan to the top DA post. Diokno had revealed last week that the economic team was “shocked” and was not consulted on the imposition of price caps on rice at P41 per kilo for regular milled and P45 for well-milled. Diokno and another member of the team, Budget Secretary Amenah Pangandaman, however, issued statements declaring support for the price caps within a short period. Shortly before the measure went into effect, Balisacan had told The STAR that the price ceilings would be lifted based on the food inflation trend. He also said the government was studying the reduction of rice tariffs to stabilize prices. The Department of Trade and Industry said the price caps would be reviewed after two weeks, amid complaints from rice retailers about massive losses and consumers’ complaints about the disappearance of regular and well-milled rice varieties. Food inflation has driven record-high inflation in the first year of the Marcos administration, with price surges and supply problems recorded in agricultural commodities including onions, white refined sugar, rice, eggs, chicken and large potatoes. Amid calls for Marcos to relinquish the DA post, he has said there have been no takers. Among the persons mentioned as possible DA secretary is former senator Mar Roxas, a relative by affinity of the President.",

      "date_published": "2024-07-15T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Department of Energy (DOE) is expecting some 12,212 households to benefit from another round of a competitive selection process (CSP) for the development of microgrid systems in remote areas of the country. The DOE will open the auction in the first week of August to interested bidders for the electrification of 41 lots composed initially of 75 identified unserved and underserved areas in the Philippines. The identified areas were among the 98 identified areas clustered into 49 lots previously offered during the first round of the CSP in November 2023. According to the DOE, these areas are viable for microgrid system providers (MGSPs) “given their higher demand, and most of the households are not widely dispersed.” “The second round of MGSP-CSP will follow a streamlined and transparent process that will allow MGSP proponents to survey the areas and prepare their proposal according to the (schedule),” it said. The submission of an expression of interest and pre-qualification is set for the fourth week of August, while the opening of technical and financial bid proposals is scheduled for the fourth week of September. The notice of award will be issued by the first week of December. Republic Act 11646, or the Microgrid Systems Act of 2022, mandates the conduct of a CSP before an MGSP can serve off-grid areas. Based on the 2023–2032 National Total Electrification Roadmap, there are 407 areas in the country that lack or have limited access to electricity, of which 285 are unserved, comprising 20,103 households, while 122 are underserved, with a total of around 20,207 households. Unserved areas are those that have no access to electricity, distribution system lines, home power systems or any microgrid system, while underserved areas refer to currently served areas where power supply is less than 24 hours daily. The DOE said that these remote areas have economic activities that require sufficient electricity services. During the first auction, the DOE awarded eight lots in the provinces of Cebu, Quezon, and Palawan to the Maharlika Consortium, consisting of Maharlika Clean Power Holdings Corp., Singapore-based CleanGrid Partners Pte Ltd. and WEnergy Global Pte Ltd. As the first winning MGSP, the consortium is expected to provide uninterrupted electricity services to said areas through a hybrid microgrid system composed of solar photovoltaic, energy storage systems and a diesel generator.",

      "date_published": "2025-01-10T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Bureau of Internal Revenue (BIR) missed its tobacco excise tax collection target by more than a quarter as illicit trade continued and became even more prevalent in the domestic market. BIR head revenue executive assistant Dondanon Galera said total tobacco excise tax collection last year stood at P134 billion, about P51 billion short of the agency’s P185 billion target collection in 2023. Total tobacco excise tax collection last year was also relatively flat compared to the P134.91 billion the BIR collected in 2023. The change in consumption patterns of smokers, including the shift to vape, and the prevalence of illicit trade in the country curtailed the BIR’s capacity to hit its collection target, Galera said. During a Senate committee on ways and means hearing, Galera admitted that sellers of illicit cigarettes and vape products have become “more brazen” last year. “They are even selling on online platforms,” he said yesterday. The BIR conducted at least 141 raids on illegal vapor products and three on illicit cigarettes last year, Galera said. Philippine Tobacco Institute president Jericho Nograles said the increase in illicit cigarette supply in the country coincided with the uptick in the number of Filipino adult smokers in recent years. Citing Food and Nutrition Research Institute data, Nograles said the percentage of adult Filipino smokers at the end of 2023 rose to 23.2 percent from 18.5 percent in 2021. This increase mirrored the rise in illicit cigarette trade in the country that reached 19.8 percent in 2023 from 13.6 percent in 2021 based on Euromonitor data, Nograles added. “Illicit trade thrives due to the availability of untaxed cigarettes sold at a fraction of legitimate products. Legal cigarettes are up to five times (more expensive) than (its) illicit counterparts,” he said. Nograles said the diminishing state revenues on tobacco excise taxes could be attributed more to tax leakages than the change in consumption patterns from cigarettes to vape. “The shift is minimal compared to the presence of illicit trade,” he said. The BIR has been reeling from the illicit trade of tobacco in the country, which contributes to why the agency has been missing its collection target for excise products. There is also the transition to vape products. The BIR has difficulties in going after illegal ones given that it has become a backyard industry whose production can be done even at home. Finance Secretary Ralph Recto earlier said the government loses at least P52 billion in revenues because of tobacco and vape smuggling with P35 billion of which being illicit tobacco products.",

      "article_body": "COTABATO CITY, Philippines — The defense department has augmented the artillery assets of the Army’s 6th Infantry Division with eight modern large truck-mounted canons from Israel to boost its anti-terror operations. Major Gen. Roy Galido, commander of 6th ID, on Saturday briefed reporters on the technical intricacies of the eight 155 millimeter Autonomous Truck Mounted Howitzer System, or ATMOS 2000, that the national government shipped to Camp Siongco in Maguindanao via the seaport in General Santos City. The eight ATMOS 2000 arrived at the Makar Port in General Santos City Thursday. “These are surely effective artillery equipment,” Galido said during a brief talk with reporters in Camp Siongco on Saturday. The 6th ID’s headquarters is located in Camp Siongco in nearby Datu Odin Sinsuat town in Maguindanao, near the Cotabato City Airport. Lt. Gen. Alfredo Rosario Jr., commander of Western Mindanao Command, said the latest weaponry system will be operated by the 10th Field Artillery Battalion of the Army Artillery Regiment based at Camp Lucero, Carmen, Cotabato. “The acquisition of these assets will significantly contribute to the peace, security, and development efforts of the government in the southwestern Philippines,” Rosario said. Each of the eight ATMOS 2000 units has an automatic shell loading system, way too advanced compared to the old 155 millimeter canons that soldiers have been using since the outbreak of the Mindanao secessionist conflict in the early 1970s. Galido said the 6th ID is thankful to acting Defense Secretary Jose Faustino Jr. and the Headquarters of the Philippine Army for sending them eight ATMOS 2000 units. He said Faustino had branded the artillery units as “game-changer” in the military’s fight against enemies of state, including terrorist groups in central Mindanao --- the Dawlah Islamiya and its ally, the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters. Both groups, operating in the fashion of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have forces in a number of towns in central Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Lanao del Sur, North Cotabato, Maguindanao, Sarangani and Sultan Kudarat. The Dawlah Islamiya and the BIFF both have a reputation for setting off home-made bombs in public places to avenge deaths of members in clashes with pursuing units of 6th ID.",

At the same time, the top health official said that they are looking at making the salary of nurses in government health facilities equivalent to what is being earned by the nurses in the private sector. “I will also meet with some of the legislators and discuss with them possible measures to make the salary of nurses both in public and private sector equitable,” said Herbosa. “What we want is to hire additional HCWs given that there are those seeking jobs abroad and we cannot prevent them from doing that,” he added. Herbosa also said that he is considering hiring graduates of a four-year medical course even though they are not board passers yet. “They can be hired in government even without their license and classify them under the board eligible category wherein they will be given three to five years to pass the board exam,” the Department of Health chief said. In a separate televised interview, Herbosa said he is willing to employ unlicensed nursing graduates if they have diplomas from accredited nursing schools. – Evelyn Macairan",

      "date_published": "2024-08-08T15:24:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Philippines amassed official development assistance (ODA) commitments amounting to $37.29 billion in 2023, according to a report released by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on Thursday. According to Republic Act 8182 or Official Development Assistance Act of 1996, ODA is a loan or grant administered \"to promote sustainable social and economic development and welfare of the Philippines.\" \"ODA resources must be contracted with governments of foreign countries with whom the Philippines has diplomatic, trade relations or bilateral agreements, or which are members of the United Nations, their agencies, and international or multilateral lending institutions,\" the law stated. The majority of ODA commitment is composed of project loans amounting to P24.94 billion, which is 67% of the total amount. There are also program loans amounting to $10.13 billion (27%) and grants worth $2.22 billion (6%). A program loan is a budget for general projects while project loans are for a specific development project. The NEDA reported a total of 90 project loans and 23 program loans. “The loan commitments reached a notable milestone in 2023, marking a significant 16% increase of $4.87 billion from the $30.20 billion committed in 2022. This surge continues the upward trend observed during the 2020-2022 period, characterized by heightened assistance in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” NEDA said in its report. Infrastructure takes up the largest portion of the ODA, with $20.36 billion dedicated to it from 105 loans and grants. The second largest portion went to governance and institutions development, with $6.88 billion allocation. The rest went to agriculture, agrarian reform and natural resources, as well as social reform and community development. According to the NEDA, the Department of Transportation is the agency that got the largest portion of the ODA, taking $13 billion for its projects. The Department of Finance and the Department of Public Works and Highway followed, respectively. The top 10 largest ODA-funded projects are as follows: North-South Commuter Railway (NSCR) Malolos-Tutuban NSCR Extension Project (Clark Extension) NSCR-Philippine National Railways (PNR) South Commuter Railway Project (Tutuban-Calamba) Metro Manila Subway Project Phase I Bataan Cavite Interlink Bridge Panay-Guimaras-Negros Island Bridges Project PNR South Long-Haul Project Cebu-Mactan Bridge and Coastal Road Construction Project Davao Public Transport Modernization Project LRT Line 1 South Extension Project Japan is the number one source of ODA for the Philippines in 2023, pledging $12.7 billion. The Asian Development Bank followed suit with $11.43 billion and the World Bank is the third largest lender, pledging $8.19 billion. Despite tensions between Beijing and Manila over the West Philippine Sea, China gave an ODA amounting to $1.16 billion.",

      "article_body": "What does it take to produce vehicle license plates and plastic driver’s license cards? For about a decade now, motorists have been promised license plates and plastic driver’s license cards. The items are fully paid for upon vehicle registration or approval of the application for a driver’s license. And yet as of today, the country still has a backlog of 130,000 plastic driver’s license cards, and the number could grow as more people renew or apply for new driver’s license. The shortage of vehicle license plates is even worse. The Commission on Audit, in its annual report on the Land Transportation Office, counted 1.797 million pairs of license plates worth P808.702 million, already paid for by vehicle owners from as far back as 2015, still undelivered. Some owners at the time had sighed that they had bought brand-new vehicles and sold these years later without ever getting the license plates. COA auditors reported that of 2,561,629 pairs of license plates paid for by vehicle owners, only 764,514 pairs had been produced by the LTO as of the end of 2022. Of the 764,514 pairs, the COA said only 506,059 had been distributed to LTO regional offices for release to the vehicle owners. The remaining 258,455 pairs were still waiting to be packaged at the LTO’s plate making plant, state auditors said. LTO data showed that since April this year, a daily average of 2,000 new drivers failed to get their plastic license cards. Officials of the LTO’s mother agency the Department of Transportation have said delivery of the plastic cards is expected to start by next week, and the situation is seen to normalize by September. Motorists can only hope that the date is September 2023 instead of another eight years of waiting. In previous years, influential groups competing to corner the production of driver’s license cards and vehicle license plates led to lawsuits that stalled production and distribution of the items. The backlog for new motorcycle plates is even worse. The COA reported that of over 20.5 million new plates paid for upon registration from 2014 to 2022, only 8.65 million for the requirements from 2018 to 2022 had been produced and issued by the LTO – a backlog of 11,859,496 motorcycle plates as of end-2022. Under the current administration, Department of Transportation officials initially said they would contract the services of government printers to speed up the production of plastic license cards. What has happened? And can the backlog in license plates ever end? Surely it doesn’t require rocket science to address the problems in the LTO.",

Eubanks said that species are disappearing at an unprecedented rate because of habitat destruction, climate change, pollution, unsustainable agricultural practices, and exploitation of natural resources. “Biodiversity loss not only threatens the survival of countless species, but also undermines the stability of ecosystems, impacting human wellbeing and livelihoods,” Eubanks added. Biodiversity refers to all life forms on the planet. “We must all take action to safeguard these precious resources for future generations,” he added. Environment Secretary Maria Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga said that the DENR has adopted a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach where partnerships and linkages are formed with other government agencies, the private sector and all stakeholders for ecosystems protection, conservation and integrity and the resilience of communities that surround these.",

      "date_published": "2023-08-29T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Criminal charges should immediately be filed against a former policeman who assaulted and drew a pistol on a cyclist, Interior and Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos said yesterday. In an interview with The STAR, Abalos said the National Police Commission (Napolcom), which he chairs, is “monitoring what is happening closely” following an allegation by lawyer Raymond Fortun that the Philippine National Police (PNP) is coddling retired policeman Wilfredo Gonzales, who was seen in a viral video striking the cyclist on the head and drawing a gun on the cyclist during a road altercation near Welcome Rotonda on Aug. 8. “I really feel that criminal charges should be filed immediately” against Gonzales, Abalos said. He added that he is not satisfied with the PNP Firearms and Explosives Office’s revocation of Gonzales’ license to own and possess firearms, firearm registration and permit to carry outside residence. Abalos said the Napolcom is also monitoring police personnel responsible for filing the criminal cases against Gonzales. Protection? In a separate radio interview, Fortun – a cyclist himself – accused the PNP of protecting Gonzales. He said that as of Sunday night, “because of the threat from the PNP, including from (Quezon City Police District director) Gen. (Nicolas) Torre (III), the family decided not to file a criminal case.” Fortun added that Torre allegedly asked the cyclist not to pursue the charges against Gonzales. “I have the text of General Torre telling the cyclist not to interfere,” he said. According to Fortun, aside from Torre, a police major also called the cyclist on Gonzales’ behalf. Under duress Fortun added that the supposed amicable settlement between Gonzales and the cyclist is null and void. “If you are forced to sign an agreement under duress, it is null and void as you have no complete freedom while signing the document,” he said. Fortun alleged that right after the incident on Aug. 8, Gonzales brought the cyclist to the La Loma police station, where the former policeman was previously assigned, and forced the cyclist to pay P500 for the damage to his car. “Since (the cyclist) had only P800, he even pleaded to allow him to pay P500 since he was shaking from hunger,” he said. According to Fortun, police reportedly forced the vlogger who uploaded the video on social media to take it down after it went viral. “The real witness here is the person who shot the video. The problem is he was also threatened by police. I also have the text that the police threatened the vlogger, saying ‘I know the color of your vehicle and I know, it was you who posted the video,’ ” he said. Fortun said that he will submit a copy of the video to the Senate and the House of Representatives for possible investigation. Meanwhile, Sen. Joseph Victor Ejercito, another cyclist, said the Land Transportation Office should revoke Gonzales’ driver’s license. “The ex-cop should still be charged with grave threats, but unfortunately the cyclist seems to have been intimidated,” Ejercito said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The Home Development Mutual Fund, commonly known as Pag-IBIG, saw its net income hit a record high P38.06 billion in 10 months, effectively increasing the agency’s overall assets. In a statement, Pag-IBIG said its strong performance for the January to October period effectively surpassed its full-year 2021 income of P34.73 billion. Pag-IBIG CEO Marilene Acosta said this boosted the agency’s total assets to P810.07 billion as of end-October. This is a 10 percent improvement or about P65.49 billion higher than the 2021 level. “Even with still two months left before the year ends, the agency’s accomplishments as of October already showed that it shall have its best-performing year yet,” Acosta said. Housing chief and Pag-IBIG Fund board of trustees chair Jose Rizalino Acuzar, for his part, said the strong growth proves that Pag-IBIG funds and savings of members are being properly managed. Acuzar emphasized that this places Pag-IBIG in a strong position to continue providing social services in line with the directive of President Marcos. Over the next six years, Pag-IBIG intends to finance at least 708,000 housing units. Pag-IBIG has 14 million active members and has P800 billion in total assets which are expected to reach P1.5 trillion by 2028.",

      "date_published": "2025-04-01T00:00:00+08:00",
      "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines — Senior High School (SHS) learners under the Technical-Vocational-Livelihood (TVL) track can now avail of free assessments for their National Certification (NC), following a joint announcement by the Department of Education (DepEd) and the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA). The latest development was shared yesterday via the agencies' respective social media pages, with DepEd also releasing the implementing guidelines for the free assessments and the expansion of competency assessors. “This is pursuant to pertinent provisions of Republic Act No. (RA) 11975 or the 'General Appropriations Act (GAA) for Fiscal Year (FY) 2024' and RA 12116 or the 'GAA for FY 2025,'” Education Secretary Sonny Angara stated via DepEd Order 003 s.2025. The order outlines the process for SHS-TVL learners to access free TESDA assessments and provides free accreditation for teaching and non-teaching personnel from both public and private schools as Technical-Vocational Education and Training (TVET) competency assessors. This initiative follows concerns over low assessment participation rates among Grade 12 learners, with figures showing only 25.7% participation in School Year (SY) 2019-2020, which further declined to just 6.8% in SY 2020-2021. The low turnout was attributed to the prohibitive costs of NC assessments, although no specific fees were mentioned. Interestingly, despite the low participation, those who took the assessments performed exceptionally well, with passing rates of 98% in SY 2019-2020 and 97% in SY 2020-2021. This highlighted the unfortunate reality that many qualified learners were unable to take the assessments due to financial constraints. DepEd emphasized that RA 11975 and RA 12116 include funding allocations to support the assessment of SHS-TVL learners and the issuance of NCs. This ensures that TESDA can conduct assessments at no cost to the students. RA 11975 also includes provisions to expand the pool of accredited competency assessors, facilitating the accreditation of additional assessors needed for the implementation of the SHS assessment and certification support programs. TESDA and DepEd will jointly oversee the selection and prioritization of eligible personnel in SHS institutions offering the TVL track. Further support is provided under RA 12116, specifically in the Development, Implementation, Monitoring, and Evaluation of Assessment and Certification Systems. This provision aims to enhance accreditation efforts, including those for SHS assessment and certification. According to the latest DepEd order, the free assessments will be available to SHS-TVL learners currently enrolled in Grades 11 and 12 in both public and private schools. Alternative Learning System (ALS) learners under the SHS-TVL track, enrolled in public and private learning centers, will also be eligible. The initiative will cover SHS-TVL learners for SY 2024-2025 and SY 2025-2026, as well as SHS-TVL graduates and ALS graduates from SY 2022-2023 and SY 2023-2024. Additionally, beneficiaries of the Joint Delivery Voucher Program (JDVP) may avail of the free assessment, provided they have completed the required training for their desired qualification. DepEd and TESDA aim to increase certification rates among SHS-TVL learners, ensuring that more students receive the necessary credentials to enhance their employment opportunities and career prospects. — (FREEMAN)",

Ginalang namin ang kanyang lahat ng Karapatan bilang dating pangulo. Sa dulo, tahimik at tinanggap ang kalagayan na dapat talagang maipatupad ang warrant of arrest at maisakay siya sa eroplano papunta sa The Hague,” he said in a TeleRadyo Serbisyo interview. “Hindi pinwersa, hindi namin kinalimutan na siya ang dating pangulo, may edad na.

Marami silang hiniling pero si President Duterte tahimik lang siya, tanggap niya ang pangyayari.” He rejected Vice President Sara Duterte’s claim that the arrest was a form of “state kidnapping.” He added Duterte can seek legal remedy with the ICC in The Hague after the court took jurisdiction of the former president. The ICC, based in The Hague, has said that there were \"reasonable grounds\" to believe Duterte committed the crime against humanity of murder as an \"indirect co-perpetrator\" during the anti-drug campaign that rights groups estimate killed tens of thousands of people. ICC Chief Prosecutor Karim Khan said Duterte’s arrest is an important moment for alleged victims of his \"war on drugs.”",

The Vice President went to the Netherlands after his father was arrested in Manila on Tuesday on an ICC warrant and was flown to The Hague. Vice President Duterte’s impeachment trial is seen to start on July 30 or more than four months from today. “Patungkol naman sa impeachment, medyo hindi pa naman ito nagsisimula, at naglabas din naman ng pahayag ang ating Pangalawang Pangulo na handa siyang harapin ang impeachment sa kanya. So, panghahawakan natin ‘yun, dahil naghahanap ang ating mga kababayan ng transparency at accountability,” House Assistant Majority Leader and Zambales 1st District Representative Jefferson Khonghun said.

Anyway, ‘yan talaga ang kultura natin bilang Pilipino.

House Assistant Majority Leader and Manila City 1st District Representative Ernesto Dionisio Jr., meanwhile, issued a reminder that the official online accounts of government agencies should not be used for personal matters. He issued the statement after the official Facebook page of the Office of the Vice President briefly changed its profile photo with one showing a ribbon with the message “Bring PRRD home”. “Minsan, lalo na ‘pag mainit ‘yung damdamin, we do things… abruptly. So, siguro that's one of the reasons why sa personal page niya, that's okay. Pero ‘pag doon sa pamahalaan, of course, kaya nga siguro tinanggal naman din nila agad. Of course, kapag government, official website, we should not use it on a personal capacity,” Dionisio said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) on Wednesday said it has spent about P210 million in the past two years for the detention of Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGO) workers arrested since the crackdown began in 2023. The PAOCC spends about “P35 million every 4 months” for the food, water, electricity, security officials and administrative costs for POGO workers who are awaiting deportation, said spokesperson Winston Casio. “Roughly two years na po so we may have spent already...P210 million to end this problem,” he told Palace reporters. The Bureau of Immigration (BI) explained that the PAOCC had to shoulder some of its costs as their detention facility in Taguig could only house up to 100 foreign nationals for deportation. ADVERTISEMENT “Ang PAOCC napakalaki ng tulong (has been a great help) in terms of housing them prior to deportation,” BI spokesperson Dana Sandoval said. As of December 2024, the PAOCC has deported 2,121 foreign nationals working in illegal POGO hubs. Nearly 340 others are awaiting deportation, according to data from the agency. “This does not include those who voluntarily left the country,” Casio said. But, Casio said, PAOCC's expenses have to be seen in the context of property seized in its operations. “We could have already gained anywhere between P20 billion to P30 billion worth of real estate properties, tangible items, cars, name it,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT He said that Anti-Money Laundering Council has already ordered market valuation of seized items and properties. Among the seized properties from POGOs that are awaiting deposition are several high-value properties in Pasay City, a hotel in Cebu, mega compounds in Tarlac and Pampanga, as well as 134 seized vehicles, Casio said. Most of the POGO-linked foreign nationals who were either deported or awaiting deportation are from Vietnam, China, Indonesia and Myanmar, data from the BI showed. Immigration officials are also working with various embassies so that they could shoulder the repatriation flights of their respective nationals who were involved in illegal gambling operations here, the agency’s spokesperson said. Last year, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. banned all POGOs in the Philippines after congressional investigations and multiple raids showed that the industry was linked to several criminal activities including torture, prostitution and human trafficking. ADVERTISEMENT Since the ban took effect on January 1, 2025, only 11,000 of the 33,000 registered POGO workers have remained in the Philippines, according to data from the BI. Of the 11,254 POGO workers who stayed in the Philippines, 121 have been deported, 518 have been arrested, while 45 other voluntarily surrendered.",

But in a statement, Child Rights Network (CRN) Philippines – considered the largest alliance moving for child rights legislation in the country – said it was better if the President explained which parts of the bill were questionable to him. \"Comprehensive Sexuality Education or CSE is just one of its components and is just a reiteration of what is already in the RH Law and the Executive Order signed by former President Duterte in response to NEDA’s declaration of teen pregnancy as a national social emergency,\" said CRN Philippines in a statement. ADVERTISEMENT \"Kami ay umaasa na hindi niya ive-veto ang isang bill na naglalayong makapagtapos ng pag-aaral ang teen parents, matulungan sila at ang kanilang mga anak through health services, at mabigyan ng age-appropriate at culturally sensitive information ang mga bata at kabataan para mapigilan ang teen pregnancy,\" it added. For the group, what's important is that the President read the provisions in the bill thoroughly and carefully, as the proposed law underwent consultations with child rights organizations. \"Wala po sa bill ang sinasabi n’yong dahilan kung bakit ito ive-veto. This bill has undergone consultations with child rights organizations responsible for advocating laws that protect the Filipino children,\" the group said. The Comprehensive Sexuality Education recently became a center of discussion after lawmakers expressed concern on its implementation by the Department of Education as early as Kindergarten, and the Senate Bill No. 1979 or the proposed Prevention of Adolescent Pregnancy Act. Sen. Risa Hontiveros, chair of one of the committees that prepared Senate Bill No. 1979, said that childhood masturbation was not part of the proposed legislation. Hontiveros earlier said critics of the bill were making false claims.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The House of Representatives has approved on second reading a bill seeking to expand the coverage of the government assistance to students in private education, to include all the years of basic education, from kindergarten to senior high school. During the House plenary session on Monday, House Bill 11214 or the proposed Private Basic Education Voucher Assistance Act was approved via viva voce or voice voting. “Presently, government assistance and subsidies are not extended to elementary education, but are confined to students in Grades 7 through 12, at the secondary level, where the challenges related to poor learning outcomes remain a significant challenge. Expanding the program to cover these earlier educational stages would help address these concerns and ensure more comprehensive support for students in need,” House Committee on Basic Education and Culture Chairperson and Pasig City Representative Roman Romulo said. “The program has played a significant role in alleviating overcrowding in public high schools,” he added. ADVERTISEMENT Under the amended version of the bill, the voucher assistance will be provided to students from middle income families as determined by the Philippine Statistics Authority, who attended public schools identified by the Department of Education as congested or those living in areas with congested public schools, or without a nearby public school, who wish to enroll in private basic education schools. Students, who are most vulnerable and underprivileged, shall receive a higher voucher amount as determined by the Basic Education Assistance Council or BEAC. Citing data from the Department of Education, Romulo said 398,930 students transferred from private to public schools at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Between 2020 and 2022, enrollment in public schools increased by 1.5 million students, while in private schools, it dropped by almost a million students.",

      "article_body": "MANILA -- Former Bayan Muna Rep. Teddy Casiño said Wednesday it will be \"easy\" to get the required number of votes in the House of Representatives to advance the impeachment complaints filed against Vice President Sara Duterte. The impeachment complaint needs one-third of the Congress or 105 votes for it to be forwarded to the Senate. \"Honestly, tingin ko madali 'yung 105... Ito'y dahil ilang buwan nang iniimbestigahan ng Kongreso ito e. Alam na alam na ng mga congressman 'yung mga pagkakamali at 'yung mga pagkukulang ng vice president,\" Casiño said in TeleRadyo Serbisyo's Johnson Ikwento Mo. \"So tingin namin, madali sila makagagawa ng desisyon. Of course, ang challenge nito ay sa Senado. Ang importante naman nito sa Senado ay magkakaroon pa ng trial 'yan... so tayo ay umaasa na kung magiging objective lamang at tapat ang mga senador, makukumbinsi sila na dapat ma-impeach ang vice president,\" he added. ADVERTISEMENT The former lawmaker, who is also the current chairperson of Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (BAYAN), said that the issue should not be seen through the lens of the politicians' alliances and parties but by their obligations to the public. \"Ano man ang kanilang partido o paniniwala, obligado ang mga congressman at senador na tingnan 'yung complaint, tingnan 'yung ebidensya, tingnan 'yung aming mga argumento na alam din ito ng buong publiko and, based on that, kailangan nilang magdesisyon batay sa kanilang konsensya at batay sa kanilang masusing pag-aaral ng ebidensiya,\" he said. When asked why they still filed an impeachment complaint despite President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.'s earlier discouragement on the matter, Casiño said it was a matter of holding the vice president accountable. \"'Yan po ay opinion ni President Marcos. Ang usapin naman dito ay hindi 'yung opinyon ng presidente. Ang usapin dito ay nagkamali ba o gumawa ba ng mga maling bagay ang vice president at paano siya pananagutin sa mga ginawa niya,\" he said. \"So for us it doesn't matter kung ang tingin ni President Marcos ay hindi dapat [mag-file.] Tingin namin, sa ilalim ng batas at Konstitusyon, may pananagutan ang vice president at kailangan niyang harapin ito,\" he continued. ADVERTISEMENT The vice president is already facing two impeachment complaints; the first was a civilian-drafted complaint filed last December 2, and the latest one was filed on December 4. The first impeachment complaint alleged Duterte committed \"culpable violations of the Constitution, graft and corruption, bribery, betrayal of public trust, and other high crimes,\" all of which are grounds for impeachment. The second one, however, only revolves around how the vice president \"betrayed the public's trust.\"",

President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos received Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the United Arab Emirates, who is currently in the Philippines for a short visit. During their meeting, Al Nahyan expressed the United Arab Emirates' gratitude to the Philippines for the contributions of the Filipinos in their country. According to a 2022 data of the Philippine Statistics Authority, the UAE is second only to Saudi Arabia as the leading destination of OFWs globally, and is currently home to 13.7 percent of the 1.96 million OFWs worldwide. \"My President… regards his gratitude to you sir, to the Philippines for how you've always been welcoming UAE, supportive to the UAE, and most of all how the Filipino people who have considered UAE as a second home have shown throughout those years not only dedication but love, and to you and the First Lady I would like to express our gratitude and appreciation,\" Al Nahyan said. ADVERTISEMENT The Philippine President thanked the UAE for the assistance and kindness it has extended to the Philippines and the Filipinos. \"And I hope that we are able to reciprocate somehow because we are very grateful for the assistance that you have done… especially to our Filipino nationals who are working in the Emirates... We extend that relationship further and make it deeper,\" he said. The Emirati official meanwhile said that while both countries have continued to grow over the years, there is still much to be done to improve it further, particularly on trade. \"Our relationship is growing, but not enough. We could do much better. It could be much better because I think we have an interest to further enhance it. But also the Philippines has shown that it's been welcoming investors, we would like to do more trade, and to finalize and sit down with the Philippines,\" he said. Also included in the meeting with Al Nahyan was Kathryna Yu-Pimentel, who took her oath Tuesday morning as Philippine Special Envoy to the UAE. Pimentel is the wife of Senator Aquilino \"Koko\" Pimentel.

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation had excess funds that totaled P89.9 billion from government allocations in the last three years, PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. confirmed before the House Committee on Appropriations on Monday. Of this amount, P27.1 billion was from 2021, P24 billion from 2022, and P38.8 billion from 2023. Lawmakers called out the “inaccurate estimates” for additional funding needed by PhilHealth for the period, and urged the state health insurer to either increase benefits or lower premium contribution rates. “Masasabi natin na error ito sa computation. Kasi kung tama ang pag-compute ng gobyerno ay hindi tayo magkakaroon ng excess funds. Ibig sabihin kung tama ang pag anticipate ng gagastusin para sa ating indigent households, para sa seniors, para sa PWD, at kayang-kaya naman itong ma-estimate, ay magiging tama sana ang isisingil sa gobyerno taun-taon,” House Committee on Appropriations Vice Chairperson and Marikina 2nd District Representative Stella Quimbo said. ADVERTISEMENT “There were a lot of duplications and the senior citizens, who apparently were either paying for their own premium or were still working, or ‘yung sumakabilang buhay na. In other words, there was an estimated 7.7 million na hiningian ng pondo. But what was validated was more or less around 5 million,” Iloilo 1st District Representative and Former Health Secretary Janette Garin. “Under the law, may dalawang courses of action ang PhilHealth, the first is pwede kayo mag-expand ng benefits. The second is pwede kayo magbaba ng kinokolekta sa kanila,” Quimbo told PhilHealth. “We are aggressively enhancing our benefits packages,” PhilHealth President and CEO Emmanuel Ledesma Jr. assured congressmen. Lawmakers also questioned PhilHealth’s exorbitant package for COVID testing, which was at P8,150 in the early parts of 2020. Garin said it was higher than the P2,000 to P2,500 range set by the World Health Organization. Former Health Secretary Francisco Duque III explained that test kits were of limited supply and global demand was high during the initial stages of the COVID pandemic, but noted that PhilHealth’s COVID test package eventually went down as the supply of test kits stabilized. ADVERTISEMENT “The issue here is the price. PhilHealth was paying P8,150 per COVID testing at ‘yun ang naging benchmark, kaya lahat ng private laboratories including government labs ay tinaga ang mga pasyente,” Garin said. “During the initial stage of pandemic, where there was scarce supply of test kits, the testing cost was clearly very high, but as soon as time went by and supplies and prices started to stabilize, then DOH with PhilHealth started to make corresponding adjustments. So they started to reformulate the testing fees, so that pababa nang pababa,” Duque replied. “It was really difficult. Everybody was scrambling for supplies. The whole world suffered from global supply chain shortage. This affected even the formulation of testing fees. You would see the downward trajectory of the testing cost as soon as the supplies became available and prices became stabilized,” he added. The Philippines, at the height of the pandemic, also entered into loan agreements with foreign financial institutions for $2.21 billion, which had a commitment fee of P162 million. But the government later decided to cancel the agreement for loans amounting to $800 million.",

You have to implement it,\" stressed Romulo. \"Ang tanong ko, kung gradual po iyan, papaano ang mga estudyante natin na hindi kasama [sa bawat taon]? So ibig sabihin they will go through the same system kung saan ipinapakita na satin ng international assessments na hindi nga ito effective,\" he also said. ADVERTISEMENT Romulo called on DepEd to revise its manner of implementation of the curriculum. \"Sana i-implement natin ito ng mas mabilis at i-implement natin na mas maayos,\" he said. DepEd, for its part, explained the need to implement the curriculum in phases. \"The design of the new curriculum is progressive at every entry level per key stage (Grades 1, 4, 7) meaning may [there are] prerequisite skills/competencies at each entry level that need to be mastered before they progress to the next grade level,\" Assistant Secretary Francis Bringas told ABS-CBN News. The MATATAG curriculum was finalized after two years of review on learning competencies and subjects of students.

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants a stricter limit on interest rates imposed by financing and lending companies. Under its draft memorandum circular, the SEC wants the maximum nominal interest rate fixed at 6 percent per month, or about 0.2 percent per day. The effective interest rate will be capped at 10 percent per month, or about 0.33 percent per day, including the nominal interest rate and all other applicable fees, like processing fees, service fees, notarial fees, handling fees, and verification fees. But this excludes penalties for late and non-payment of outstanding scheduled amounts due. ADVERTISEMENT Lending and financing companies may only charge penalties of up to 5 percent per month for late payment or non-payment on outstanding amounts due. Lending companies that break this rule will be fined P25,000 for the first offense, and P50,000 for the second offense. Financing companies, meanwhile, will be fined P50,000 for the first offense and P100,000 for the second offense. On the third offense, the SEC may impose a fine equivalent to at least twice the penalty for the second offense, but not more than P1 million. The company’s financing and lending activities may also be suspended for 60 days, and its secondary license may be revoked. ADVERTISEMENT If the offense is grave, the SEC may also suspend or revoke the company’s primary registration. The securities regulator is seeking public comments on the draft circular until November 14. SEC said it is doing this to strike a balance between consumer protection and the competitiveness of duly licensed lending and financing companies. “The number of borrowers struggling under excessive interest rates has continued to grow in recent years, as certain entities exploit the accessibility of online lending applications to trap our fellow kababayans in cycles of debt,” chairperson Francis Lim said. The SEC has been cracking down on online lending apps. ADVERTISEMENT In May, it revoked the corporate registration and financing license of Digido after it opened and operated four branches without obtaining a certificate of authority. In the same month, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of MagicPeso over abusive collection practices. It also filed criminal complaints against the operator of online lending app Easypeso for abusive collection practices. Earlier in October, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of online lending platforms Credit Cash and Credit Peso over unfair debt collection practices. The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission has monitored some 300 online lending apps, many of which are bogus. Some bogus lenders even go so far as to issue rape or death threats to borrowers so they would pay up. Authorities, however, are facing a blank wall in going after abusive lending apps since the companies simply discard these preregistered SIM cards after promoting their services or threatening their borrowers.",

The NIA is pushing to build 10 dams this year, as well as 50 medium and 3 high dams by the end of Marcos Jr.’s term, said NIA administrator Eduardo Guillen. “Ang gusto ng ating pangulo ay mag shift tayo from flood control to water management,” he said in a press conference in Malacañang. “Kaya tayo nagkakaproblema ay yung mga malalaking dam na inaasahan natin ngayon… tinayo ito 50 years ago… Unfortunately, hindi na natin yan sinundan ng mga ganitong proyekto,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Ang gusto ng ating pangulo ngayon ay magtayo ng high dams,” he added, noting that these can also be used as in flood control, irrigation, hydro power, aquaculture, floating solar and tourism efforts. The NIA has crafted a design and build manual to quicken the construction of these dams, Guillen said. “Masho-shorten niya yung implementation ng dam from conception to actual construction by 3 years,” he said. Guillen also told reporters that despite the El Niño phenomenon, corn production increased by 5.9 percent, while rice production improved by 1.1 percent. So far, only 1 percent of farmlands were not irrigated, he said, saying these are the “tail-ends” of the irrigation lines. Last year, the Senate questioned the NIA’s failure to finish projects on time, including a dam in Tarlac that was supposed to provide irrigation for 34,000 hectares in 10 municipalities, to benefit 23,000 farmers. NIA told senators the project has been terminated with its former contractor.",

      "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) -- Nine Filipino crew members of an oil tanker seized by Iran's navy in the Gulf of Oman arrived in the Philippines on Sunday. Lord Rangasajo, one of the crew members who arrived, said they had positive interactions with the Iranians. \"Maganda naman po ang pakikiharap ng mga Iranian sa amin. Wala naman po kaming naging problema,\" he said. He also mentioned that they were not harassed. ADVERTISEMENT \"Mga eight commandos, they boarded us with the heavy guns but okay naman sila,\" he said. The Department of Foreign Affairs revealed that two more are expected to return this week. \"'Yung dalawang aalis pa, Tuesday or Wednesday aalis sila,\" DFA Usec. Eduardo de Vega said. (Two more will depart on Tuesday or Wednesday.) The remaining six are awaiting replacements before returning to the Philippines. ADVERTISEMENT \"Hindi naman sila hostage per se, kasi kusang loob silang naiwan doon dahil binigyan ng double salary kaya out of their own free will sila na naiwan doon,\" he said. (They are not hostages per se because they willingly stayed there due to the double salary offered, so they chose to remain voluntarily.) In an interview on Bagong Pilipinas Ngayon on Monday, De Vega said the crew are healthy and happy to be back in the country. The nine seafarers were able to return after they were replaced by Russian counterparts. “Ang kailangan na lang diyan mapalitan sila ng ibang crew men. Kasi ang sabi ng port authority sa Iran at saka ng manning agency, puwede namang umuwi kahit sino basta palitan sila kasi kailangan nagpapatakbo ng barko. Originally naisip nila Filipino rin ang kukunin eh hindi bakit kukuha eh di pareho din magkakaroon pa ng mga Filipinong ipit doon. Kaya ang sabi namin dapat ibang bansa,” De Vega explained. ADVERTISEMENT (What is needed is for them to be replaced by other crew men. The port authority in Iran and the manning agency said anyone can come home so long as they are replaced because a ship operator is needed. What they originally thought was to get other Filipinos but that would put them in a pickle as well. That’s why we said it should be another nationality.) “‘Yung sahod nila tuloy pa, binabayaran sila ng manning agency pero ang pagbayad dito sa pamilya dito sa Pilipinas. At ang sabi ng Department of Migrant Workers, ang nakikipag-ugnayan sa manning agency, pinaakyat pa nga ang suweldo,” De Vega said. (They continued to receive their salary, but this was paid to their family here in the Philippines. The Department of Migrant Workers who is coordinating with the manning agency, said the pay was actually increased.) The Overseas Workers Welfare Administration (OWWA) assured they are ready to provide psychocounseling to arriving seafarers, along with financial assistance accommodation, and air fare if they need to return to their provinces. \"Kakausapin po muna natin sila kung magdecide sila na magse-settle sila rito sa Pilipinas then we will provide reintegration sa kanila,\" OWWA Deputy Administrator Atty. Honey Quiño said. ADVERTISEMENT (We will first discuss with them if they decide to settle in the Philippines, and then we will provide reintegration support.) The Filipino crew members were under Iran's custody following the Iranian Navy's seizure of the oil tanker St. Nikolas in the Gulf of Oman in January. Iran's action was a retaliatory response to the confiscation of Iranian crude oil from the same vessel by US forces in 2023. -- With a report from Victoria Tulad, ABS-CBN News.",

The development is open to the public from 6 p.m. to 10 p.m., authorities earlier said. The project will eventually include jogging paths, bike lanes and commercial areas with retail stores and cafes. Once the promenade is completed, it is expected to traverse 5 cities, giving the public a “major transportation lane that will cut across local governments of the National Capital Region,” said Undersecretary Avelino Tolentino III of the Department of Human Settlements and Urban Development (DSHUD). ADVERTISEMENT To aid in the clean-up of the Pasig River, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) is also adding trash skimmers which prevent floating debris and garbage from flowing along the river. It has also started recycling water hyacinths and water lilies to make charcoals briquettes and lily pots. All plans to rehabilitate and develop the Pasig River to make it a tourist attraction is expected to be completed within the term of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the MMDA said. Last week, Marcos said the rehabilitation of the Pasig River would be a “people-centered, community-driven development” instead of a mere “cosmetic” project. Informal settlers who will be affected by the project will not be displaced, as housing units will be built within the city where these families reside, the MMDA had said. The DHSUD earlier said the P18 billion needed to establish the mixed-use riverside park would be sourced from the private sector. — With reports from Joyce Balancio and Katrina Domingo, ABS-CBN News",

      "article_body": "Three Land Transportation Office employees were arrested Thursday after they were caught stealing license plates from the agency’s plate making plant in Quezon City. LTO Chief Assistant Secretary Atty. Vigor D. Mendoza II identified the 3 as embossers Jenard Arida and Arjay Anasco; and warehouse staff Valeriano Nerizon, all assigned to the plate making plant at the LTO Central Office in Quezon City. Mendoza also ordered a manhunt against Allan Joker Abrigo, another LTO employee who served as team leader and possibly the boss of the three arrested suspects. \"Gaya ng ipinangako natin sa taumbayan, we will not tolerate this kind of illegal activity and we will make sure that those who would dare to continue with their wrongdoings will be caught and held responsible. The arrest of these three people is proof of that,\" the LTO chief said. The investigation started after the LTO Intelligence and Investigation Division led by Renante G. Militante received information last year about possible theft of license plates. The investigation showed the three suspects were allegedly threatening their co-workers in the plate making plant if they would spill the beans on their modus. On Jan. 25, Militante was tipped that the three were again doing illegal activity, prompting him to contact Police Col. Bernard Yang, Senior Police Assistant to Interior and Local Government Secretary Benhur Abalos. A PNP operation led to the arrest of the three suspects while sneaking out five pieces of license plates out of the plant Thursday noon. “Based on the result of the investigation, they are selling the license plates at P10,000 per piece. We are now trying to determine how long and how many license plates have been stolen by these errant employees,” said Mendoza. \"There is a syndicate behind these people involved in carnapping, smuggling and other serious crimes. We will run after the mastermind and the buyers. It appears na matagal na itong embedded at the LTO. More employees will be investigated as part of our weeding out of scalawags,\" he added. The suspects are now detained and are facing charges of Violation of Article 310 (Qualified Theft) and Article 294 (Robbery) of the Revised Penal Code. They will also face administrative charges. Technical Carnapping Based on the investigation, the 3 are being linked to a scheme involving newly-acquired motor vehicles through financing. The modus starts with a leader or a financier who will acquire a vehicle through financing and will illegally sell the vehicle using duplicated plates and fake OR/CR. The financier then procures the \"fake\" plates from his contact inside LTO at P20,000 per pair. ADVERTISEMENT",

      "article_body": "Senator Sherwin Gatchalian urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Friday to use his executive powers to shut down Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators (POGOs). “I am hoping that the President, through his executive power, already to start to whine down and eventually ban POGO. It’s causing us, not only social harm, but yung budget natin kinakain na rin,” Gatchalian said. The Philippine government has spent public funds to feed detained foreign POGO workers while processing their deportation proceedings and eventually, by loading them to the plane as deportees. “Imagine mo 200 ang dino-document nila, marami dun peke pa pangalan... tapos pagkain nila. Kasi kahit na dine-deport natin sila, we have to treat them like a human being and with dignity. Again, magastos yan and again wala namang naidudulot sa atin, bakit pa natin kailangang ipagpatuloy.” Gatchalian said. ADVERTISEMENT Gatchalian made a call while underlining his belief that unscrupulous POGO players and syndicates behind them continue to commit crimes in the country. “It’s not because tahimik ngayon ang POGO does not mean that there’s no crime happening,” said Gatchalian, chairman of the Senate Committee on Ways and Means. Gatchalian made the call a week after Congress marked the start of its Christmas break, leaving his POGO committee report’s recommendation to ban it in the Philippines, untouched. He also gave the President a copy of his report. While visiting Mindoro province, he said that Rep. Alfonso Umali told him that kidnapping activities in the province targeting Filipino-Chinese are becoming rampant. ADVERTISEMENT “He showed he showed me a video na mga local Chinese kinkidnap at tino-torture,” Gatchalian said. Aside from appealing to the President, Gatchalian vowed to talk to Senate President Juan Miguel Zubiri regarding the need to discuss his committee report on the floor. “We will continue to push. It’s already filed in the Senate. I just need to talk to the leadership on how to go about.. as long as POGO is allowed, we are allowing criminal syndicates to come in to our country,” the senator pointed out. “Magiging tahanan tayo ng mga criminal syndicates from China operating here,” he stressed. POGOs’ continued operations, coupled with the government’s plan to give Chinese tourists a “visa free” or “visa upon entry” arrangement are grave danger for the country, Gatchalian said. ADVERTISEMENT “Eh ngayon nga may POGO problem tayo nakakapasok sila ng madali, just imagine giving them visa free. It’s like a license for criminal syndicates to operate here in the Philippines. So, as long as POGO is here, it’s impossible to increase tourism coming from China because nahahaluan ng criminal syndicates coming to the Philippines,” he added.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The government remains firm in its stand not to extend the deadline for the consolidation of operators to comply with the jeepney modernization program. Transportation Undersecretary Timothy John Batan on Tuesday said there will be no more extension beyond the December 31 due date, despite appeals from drivers and operators to give them more time to comply with the policy. However, many jeepney drivers and operators remain hesitant to join a cooperative or corporation. Under a cooperative, an operator will lose ownership of his unit as this will now form part of the asset of the group that formed the juridical entity. A driver interviewed by ABS-CBN said his job as a driver is now hanging in the balance, 3 days before the last office day of the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) for this year. Another driver and jeepney operator, meanwhile, said he is not willing to give up ownership of his unit which he bought for P90,000. HOPE AND APPEAL Transport group Piston remains hopeful that a temporary restraining order [TRO] will be issued by the Supreme Court after it brought the issue to the highest court. Manibela, on the other hand, appealed for compassion from President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. for the plight of drivers and operators who will lose their livelihood once the LTFRB suspends their operation come January 2024. Manibela said there are still around 40,000 traditional jeepney units that have yet to join the consolidation. When asked about the veracity of the figure, the Department of Transportation said they cannot yet dispute it, pending the LTFRB updating its record. But the DOTr said the LTFRB will issue special permits to plug the expected shortage of jeepneys in several routes in Metro Manila. Dispatching buses will be an option to ferry more passengers who are going to be affected by the shortage of traditional jeepneys, in case the impasse between Manibela/Piston and LTFRB is not resolved, the transport department said.",

Currently, there are 8 groups who showed interest and have bought bid documents. Bautista said though the December 27 deadline is still over a month away, that might be a short time if a new group wants to join the bidding for the rehabilitation, operation and expansion of NAIA. “It will take time for them to do the due diligence to study. It will take longer time to prepare the proposal,” said Bautista. He added that he met one-on-one some of the groups and so far, their plans and proposals appear to be viable. The eight prospective bidders who bought bid documents are: GMR Airports International B.V., San Miguel Holdings Corp., Manila International Airport Consortium, Spark 888 Management, Inc, Asian Airport Consortium, Cengiz Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S., Incheon International Airport Corporation, and Limak Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret A.S. Bautista also commented on the statement of Cavite Governor Jonvic Remulla on co-branding Sangley airport with NAIA. Bautista said it needs to be studied by experts since it’s a new concept. “Kailangan review-hin technically, kung possible although yung runway niya [Sangley], yung orientation ay halos pareho [sa NAIA],\" he said. The winning bidder of the P170 billion project is expected to be announced in the first quarter of next year. The winning bidder will be given 15 years to rehabilitate the airport’s passenger terminals and airside facilities. The deal may be extended for another 10 years if NAIA improvement targets are met.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The grant of bail to former Sen. Leila de Lima after nearly 7 years of detention is a \"testament\" to the Philippine judiciary's \"independence,\" according to Sen. Imee Marcos. Muntinlupa RTC Branch 206 Judge Gener Gito allowed De Lima to post bail in the last drug case against her. It was a reversal of a denial by another judge in June of her petition for bail. \"The independence of the judiciary is present and true. Our court is a court of law and justice, oblivious of personalities or any political noise. Sen. De Lima’s bail yesterday was a testament to that,\" the senator said. Making a similar comment on Monday, Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla said the grant of bail showed that courts are independent and \"that democracy is alive and well in our country.\" ADVERTISEMENT De Lima had long insisted the charges were fabricated in retaliation for her investigation into then-President Rodrigo Duterte' war on drugs, which is now subject of an investigation at the International Criminal Court (ICC). Asked on ANC's \"Headstart\" whether bail would have been imaginable while Duterte was president, De Lima lawyer Bonifacio Tacardon said, \"Based on our experience in Criminal Case No. [17-165], I think my answer to that question will be in the negative.\" He said that bail in that case was denied \"despite our confidence that evidence against our client was not strong.\" Tacardon added De Lima's legal team \"really felt pressure from all over with respect to that criminal case.\" De Lima was acquitted in Criminal Case No. 17-165 in May. ADVERTISEMENT In a separate interview on TeleRadyo Serbisyo, Dino De Leon — De Lima's spokesperson and a member of her legal team — said the former senator was \"politically attacked every step of the way, her reputation was destroyed by an organized machinery of the state.\" De Lima, who is facing the last of three drug cases filed against her during the Duterte administration, was accused of taking money from inmates inside the Bilibid. Several witnesses died or recanted their testimonies, resulting in the dismissal of two of the three charges against de Lima. She still faces life in prison if convicted on the remaining charge. Sen. Marcos said the grant of bail showed there was no need for the ICC to get involved in drug war cases. \"[ICC] has no business meddling with our justice system,\" Sen. Marcos said. ADVERTISEMENT The International Criminal Court is meant to be a court of last resort, for when national authorities are unable or unwilling to investigate and prosecute cases like the alleged crimes against humanity in the war on drugs. Human rights groups and advocates for drug war victims say domestic processes have failed to provide accountability and justice in the deaths. The ICC in July ruled that it would proceed with its investigation on the killings during Duterte's drug war, denying the Philippine government's appeal on the contrary.",

Justice Secretary Jesus Crispin Remulla confirmed the DOJ has already submitted its comment on the petitions for habeas corpus filed by Davao City 1st District Rep. Paolo Duterte, Davao City Mayor Sebastian Duterte and Veronica Duterte. “We were given authorization by the Executive Secretary to, kami na ang sumagot, OK na, nabigay na namin ang comment namin kahapon,” Remulla said on Tuesday. This, after the Office of Solicitor General (OSG), the government's default lawyer, opted out of the case, citing conflict in previous positions. ADVERTISEMENT “Considering the OSG's firm position that the ICC is barred from exercising jurisdiction over the Philippines... the OSG may not be able to effectively represent Respondents in these cases and is constrained to recuse itself from participating herein,” Solicitor General Menardo Guevarra said in his motion filed Monday. Duterte was arrested Tuesday last week after the Interpol served the arrest warrant issued by the ICC. He was sent to The Hague, Netherlands on the same day. President Marcos said the Philippine government cooperated with the Interpol and not with the ICC in delivering Duterte to The Hague. Asked if it is still possible to ask the International Criminal Court to bring back Duterte to the Philippines, Remulla said that might not be possible. “Wala na iyon, tapos na iyon, it’s a done deal already,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Remulla refused to divulge the details of the arguments they presented to the court. “Hayaan na natin, iyong dokumentong binigay namin sapat na iyon para sagutin ang mga sinabi nila sa korte,” Remulla said. Meantime, Remulla refused to comment on Guevarra’s recusal to represent the government before the Supreme Court. “I will not speak about the comment because it is with the court right now,” Remulla said. Former Senior Associate Justice Antonio Carpio said Marcos should consider firing Guevarra over his refusal to defend the government in the Duterte case.",

She shared how the deteriorating situation in Gaza led them to flee, saying, “Pag pinapasabog po kami sa gabi tumatakbo kaming mag-iina malapit sa wall para mag umpok-umpukan lang po.” Ravelina recounted the hardships she and her family faced due to the Israel-Hamas war, including the lack of water and electricity. “Wala kaming kuryente, wala po kaming tubig. Almost one month sumasandok lang kami sa ilalim ng bahay ng isang building na tinitirhan namin. Doon kami kumukuha,” she said. According to DFA Assistant Secretary Robert Ferrer, upon their arrival, the families went through debriefing sessions to address the trauma they experienced. “May crisis management ang DSWD dito so we have trained psychologists, trained people,” Asec. Ferrer said. Ferrer emphasized that those with families or relatives in the country will be permitted to come home, while those without will be presented with various options through a government program. “Those who have not any connection with the country like wala sila kamag-anak, we will connect them with their LGUs, with their relatives here,” he said. “'Yung wala, we have already informed DSWD and the other agencies about it and we are having an inter-agency process.” Ferrer admitted there are still Filipinos who opted to stay in Gaza despite the volatile situation. “Their own decision po 'yun but we are asking them to change their mind and go home na lang,” Ferrer said. ADVERTISEMENT As of Tuesday, there are a total of 89 Filipinos and their 14 Palestinian spouses who have returned home to the Philippines. A fourth batch of evacuees is expected to arrive Wednesday.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has thanked the United Arab Emirates for issuing a pardon for 115 convicted Filipinos to mark this year’s Eid Al-Adha, saying that the gesture is a testament to the two countries’ “special partnership.” The president did not mention what crimes these Filipino convicts committed but noted that Emirati Ambassador to the Philippines Mohamed Obaid Alqataam Alzaabi personally relayed the good news. “This gesture is a reflection of our countries’ special partnership, as embodied in the nearly one million Filipinos who have made the Emirates their home and in the warm personal friendship and mutual respect between myself as the leader of the Emiratis,” Marcos Jr. said in a statement posted on Saturday. \"[S]uch acts of kindness pave the way for continued cooperation and understanding in the years to come,” the President said. ADVERTISEMENT “On behalf of the Philippine government, we extend our sincerest thanks to President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan for this compassionate act,” he added. The Philippine Embassy in the UAE and the Consulate General in Dubai on Saturday called the grant of royal clemency a “benevolent act, which further strengthens the longstanding bonds of friendship and cooperation” between the two countries. Last year, 143 Filipinos received a pardon for their crimes in the UAE in time for Eid Al-Adha, while 220 others were given the same reprieve to mark the Middle Eastern country’s national day. Of the 2.16 million registered overseas Filipino workers in 2023, 13.6 percent are based in the UAE, according to data from the Philippine Statistics Authority.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The chief of the police Criminal Investigation and Detection Group admitted Thursday that he denied Vice President Sara Duterte entry into Villamor Air Base before her father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, was brought to The Hague this week. CIDG chief MGen. Nicolas Torre noted that the elder Duterte was already with his lawyers at that time. \"Bakit kailangang dagdagan pa ang gulo?\" said Torre, who acted as ground commander during Duterte's arrest. Torre headed the Davao regional police before serving as CIDG chief. He also led the two-week operation to arrest controversial religious leader Pastor Apollo Quiboloy, a close ally of the Dutertes. ADVERTISEMENT Vice President Duterte said her father's arrest was an affront to the country's sovereignty and described it as \"state kidnapping.\" The Marcos administration rejected this allegation, saying the arrest was lawful because of an existing International Criminal Court warrant that was coursed through the International Criminal Police Organization or Interpol, of which the country is a member. Duterte insisted that the ICC lacked jurisdiction over the Philippines and the former president because of the withdrawal of the Philippines from the Rome Statute in 2019. The International Criminal Court took ex-President Duterte into custody Wednesday to face charges over his war on drugs. The ICC, based in The Hague, believes there are \"reasonable grounds\" to charge Duterte with murder as a crime against humanity, as an \"indirect co-perpetrator\" during the anti-drug campaign that rights groups estimate killed tens of thousands. ADVERTISEMENT \"I am the one who led our law enforcement and military. I said that I will protect you and I will be responsible for all of this,\" Duterte said in a video posted to his and a close advisor's Facebook pages. \"I have been telling the police, the military, that it was my job and I am responsible,\" said the 79-year-old, the first Asian former head of state to appear before the ICC. A spokesman confirmed Duterte was in court custody after he arrived in Rotterdam by private jet. A vehicle thought to be carrying Duterte drove into the ICC detention center in The Hague past a crowd of dozens of supporters, some shouting: \"Bring him back\" and waving national flags. Duterte will be held there until an initial court appearance, likely in the coming days.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The head of Philippine Health Insurance Corp. (PhilHealth) promised accountability in the state insurer's ranks in response to a Supreme Court magistrate who said an overhaul is needed in light of its budget issues. During the third day of oral arguments on Tuesday, March 4, regarding the controversial transfer of P89.9-billion in excess PhilHealth reserve funds to the national treasury, Supreme Court Associate Justice Antonio Kho Jr. said it may be time to revamp the PhilHealth board \"for not complying with what the law requires\" in requesting its budget from Congress. PhilHealth president and CEO Edwin Mercado, who assumed office last month noted the 'dedication' of the members of the board. \"Nakikita ko naman po ang dedikasyon ng ating board members. Bagamat ganoon po eh lahat naman po kami dito maging ako man po ay ina-assess po regularly ang performance,\" Mercado said in a television interview Wednesday. ADVERTISEMENT (I can see the board members' dedication. Our performance is assessed regularly, even mine) He said the PhilHealth board under his leadership will be \"metrics driven\" and will have accountability. The transfer of supposedly excess funds has raised questions on why PhilHealth had them and did not use them to benefit members, and whether the money could legally be transferred for use for other government projects. The state insurer also said that PhilHealth will abide with \"whatever the decision of the Supreme Court\" on the P60-billion fund already transferred to the national treasury. Kho, in the same oral arguments, said PhilHealth must urge President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to release an order reverting the transferred “excess funds” to PhilHealth to be used in expanding its benefit packages and improving services. ADVERTISEMENT \"Kami ho ay naniniwala na patas po ang proseso, ito po ay pinakikinggan ng talaga pong mga mahistradong sanay po at bihasa dito sa ating mga batas. Kung ano po ang desisyon ng ating kataas-taasang hukuman, kami po ay mag-a-abide, kami po ay susunod,\" Mercado stated. (We believe that this is a fair process and magistrates who are experienced and are experts in the law are listeninh. We will abid by whatever the Supreme Court decides) The SC will hold its fourth round of oral arguments on April 29.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Philippine Navy is preparing for the possible occupation of two islands in Subic Bay once these are declared as military reservations. Grande Island and Chiquita Island are located at the southern entrance of Subic Bay, which was once a United States military base until the Philippine Senate rejected a lease extension in 1991. The facility has since been transformed into a freeport zone. “The thrust right now of the Philippine Navy is to prepare for the eventual occupation or preparation of the land that will be awarded through a presidential proclamation declaring part of SBMA [Subic Bay Metropolitan Authority] and Grande Island and Chiquita Island as military reservations,” Rear Admiral Roy Vincent Trinidad, PN spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, told reporters at Camp Aguinaldo in Quezon City on Tuesday. ADVERTISEMENT According to Trinidad, Grande Island and Chiquita Island need to be declared as military reservations due to their proximity to Subic Bay — its “natural layout” providing safe harbor for Navy ships using the waterway. There is also an existing runway in Subic Bay, which can be used by Philippine aircraft. “Hence, the need to be able to have a military presence, a foothold in the Subic area,” Trinidad said. But the official clarified that the move to turn the two islands into military reservations has nothing to do with the arrest of six foreign nationals and two Filipinos found conducting illegal activities on Grande Island on March 19. “The foreign nationals that were arrested on Grande Island were there even before the talks of having that as a naval reservation. Nauna sila doon bago lumabas yung news na gagawing naval reservation ang part of Subic Bay,” Trinidad noted. ADVERTISEMENT Authorities nabbed five Chinese, a Cambodian and two Filipinos on the island last week due to suspected espionage and kidnapping activities related to Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs). In a statement released on March 20, the Department of National Defense (DND) said converting Grande Island and Chiquita Island would enhance security for the Subic Special Economic and Freeport Zone, including the Riviera Wharf and the Subic Bay International Airport. It added that the planned conversion aligns with the \"ongoing development of the naval operating base of the PN to strengthen and maintain our strategic presence along our western seaboard.\" Grande Island is a strategic vantage point with a clear view of key sea lanes in the West Philippine Sea, including Bajo de Masinloc or Scarborough Shoal.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — Transport group Manibela on Tuesday called on passengers to join a protest against the PUV modernization program's franchise consolidation requirement, which they said could take thousands of traditional jeepneys off the roads by January. The PUV modernization program requires jeepney operators to consolidate individual franchises into a single franchise under a cooperative or corporation by December 31, 2023. Failure to do so could revoke their permits to operate, authorities earlier said. Manibela estimates that around 40,000 jeepneys have yet to comply with the requirement. \"Malaki pa rin po ang kawalan nito na masasakyan ng ating mga kababayan,\" the group's leader, Mar Valbuena, told TeleRadyo Serbisyo. ADVERTISEMENT He said they have yet to receive any feedback from authorities on their bid to move the deadline, leaving drivers no other choice but to wait for the Supreme Court to act on their petition to block the franchise consolidation. \"Hindi po kami nawawalan ng pag-asa… Maghihintay po tayo,\" he said of their petition. But if the Supreme Court rejects their petition, Valbuena said, \"Wala po tayong magagawa doon kundi protesta talaga ang kailangan nating iparamdam, baka mas malaki pang protesta ang kailangan nating ipakita sa gobyerno.\" \"Baka sakaling ang commuters, sumama na sa atin sa pagpoprotesta,\" he added. \"Sana ang puso ng ating Pangulo ay haplusin nawa po ng ating Panginoon na magkaroon siya ng puso sa ating drivers, operators, lahat po ng maapektuhan nito. Domino effect po ang mangyayari dito,\" Valbuena said. ADVERTISEMENT \"At sana kasama na ang Supreme Court… yung mga mahistrado po natin ay pumabor at makita na yung petition ng ating mga kasamahan ay talaga namang hindi handa ang ating gobyerno. Sana walang sapilitan at magpatuloy po ang aning hanapbuhay,\" he said. Another transport group, Piston, said it was studying whether it would continue plying roads after the Dec. 31 deadline. It is also considering bringing its protest to the gates of Malacañang. \"Pinag-aaralan po natin at lagi naman po tayong bukas na posible talaga itong umabot sa kampohan sa labas ng Malakanyang,\" Piston president Mody Floranda said in a separate TeleRadyo Serbisyon interview. Jeepney drivers and operators have said \"modern jeepneys\" are too expensive and will deprive single-unit operators of route franchises that will then go to big corporations and to transport cooperatives. Some drivers and operators have argued that upgrading existing jeepneys will be a less expensive way to make them more fuel efficient and environment friendly. ADVERTISEMENT But the transport department said forming a cooperative would allow operators easier access to funds, especially when applying for loans for the modern jeepneys. The franchise consolidation deadline has been extended six times since 2020, noted Transport Undersecretary Timothy John Batan. He said 30 percent of in Metro Manila PUVs have complied with the required as of November. Authorities are still consolidating the latest figures for December, he said. Regulators will issue special permits for routes that might see fewer jeepneys in January if drivers fail to consolidate and their franchises are be revoked, added the official.",

Hegseth met with President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. in Malacañang where he emphasized that the Trump administration is committed to the country’s alliance and partnership with the Philippines. “I had a chance to speak just a few minutes ago to our president, President [Donald] Trump, who sends his regards to you as well, thinks very fondly of this great country, is very committed to the alliance that we have, to the friendship that we have, the cooperation that we have,” Hegseth said. “And he and I both want to express the ironclad commitment we have to the mutual defense treaty and to the partnership, economically, militarily, which our staffs have worked on diligently for weeks and weeks and months,” he continued. ADVERTISEMENT “There is a very real reason why our first trip and our first visit is here to visit you in your great country.” The US Defense chief expressed the United States’ interest in further expanding military cooperation with the Philippines, which he says is critically important amid \"threats\" posed by China in the Indo-Pacific region. He also noted the importance of deterrence and for allies to stand “shoulder-to-shoulder” to ensure peace and freedom of navigation in the South China Sea. “Peace through strength is a very real thing. Deterrence is necessary around the world, but specifically in this region, in your country, considering the threats from the Communist Chinese and that friends need to stand shoulder-to-shoulder to deter conflict, to ensure that there's free navigation,” Hegseth said. Marcos meanwhile emphasized the Philippines’ longstanding alliance with the United States, as well as the critical role of the US in ensuring peace in the Indo-Pacific region as he welcomed Hegseth to Manila. ADVERTISEMENT “Your visit to the region, and especially the fact that you have come to the Philippines as your first stop, is a very strong indication and sends a very strong message of the commitment of both our countries to continue to work together, to maintain the peace in the Indo-Pacific Region within the South China Sea,” the President said. Malacañang Press Officer Claire Castro meanwhile welcomed the US Defense chief’s reaffirmation of the US commitment to its mutual defense treaty with the Philippines. “Opo, magandang-magandang balita po iyan para sa ating bansa. Katunayan nga po ay nagkaroon po ng reaffirmation ng US commitment to uphold our Mutual Defense Treaty,” Castro said. (Yes, that is good news for the country.

According to Duque, his remark \"has regrettably been taken out of context.\" Duque insisted that the transfer of funds for the procurement of common-use supplies and equipment (CSEs) such as face masks, face shields, and PPEs was above-board given the urgency and novelty of the situation. \"What has been lost in the political noise is the fact that these CSEs were procured sometime in April 2020, during the very beginning of the pandemic... Their procurement was not only necessary, but was of extreme urgency,\" Duque said. ADVERTISEMENT The Ombudsman in May said that the medical supplies were not CSEs, a term that usually refers to office supplies. \"Indeed, the directive of President Duterte was consistent with and pursuant to the national policy embodied in the Bayanihan to Heal as One Act 1 and 2,\" he added. Duque also said that Duterte's authorization for the transfer was not new as it was well-documented in his public pronouncements. \"President Duterte has been consistent and open in directing his administration, as a whole, to act swiftly and decisively and do all that it can to fight the pandemic... His directives were openly made and repeated during our numerous cabinet meetings, his regular televised public address, and in various interviews reported by news outlets,\" Duque explained. The purchase of the COVID-19 supplies was allegedly marred by corruption, with Pharmally accused of being a preferred contractor. ADVERTISEMENT Former Senate President Franklin Drilon earlier said that Duque's statement during the hearing was a \"change of tune\". Sen. Risa Hontiveros said Duterte should explain why he ordered the transfer of funds. Government officials, including Duterte, had defended the transaction, saying there was a need to fast-track procurement because of the COVID-19 emergency and that the controversial firm had delivered on the contracts.",

      "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) -- The MRT Line 7 will be partly operational by the fourth quarter of 2025, a Department of Transportation (DOTr) official said Tuesday. Transportation Assistant Secretary for Railways Jorjette Aquino said the MRT-7's Quezon City portion, which consists of 12 stations, will be up and running towards the end of next year. Meanwhile, the Tala Station in Caloocan City will be completed by 2026. Aquino said they hope the construction of the 14th station in San Jose del Monte in Bulacan can be finished by 2027 once alignment issues are resolved. ADVERTISEMENT The city government of San Jose Del Monte earlier proposed 3 alternative route alignments for the project. In a statement, Mayor Arthur Robes said the current plan had current and future traffic implications, and would affect the quality of living, as well as disrupt the delivery of essential services, among others. Aquino said the DOTr, together with the private sector proponent San Miguel Corporation, will conduct a joint site inspection of these proposed realignments this June. \"After that inspection, inaasahan namin na ang San Miguel ang magkakaroon ng ridership study sa bawat option at bawat alignment para mai-presenta nila sa DOTr at makipagbigay sila ng recommendation nila kung ano sa tingin nila yung magiging mas beneficial sa mga pasahero,\" she said. (After that inspection, we expect San Miguel to come up with a ridership study for each option and each alignment that they can present to the DOTr along with a recommendation of what they see as the most beneficial (route) for passengers.) ADVERTISEMENT Aquino noted that one of their main considerations is accessibility. \"Siyempre tinitignan natin yung convenience ng pasahero. Malapit ba ito sa mga transport terminals? Para mas madaling mapuntahan,\" she said. (Of course, we’re looking at what will be convenient for passengers. Will it be near other transport terminals? So that it will be easily accessible.) Aquino added that should there be adjustments to the location of the station, it would not be too far off from the original plan. \"Hindi naman siguro totally maiiba, still within the area. Yung exact location lang e siguro magkakaroon ng displacement ng 100 meters,\" said Aquino. ADVERTISEMENT (It probably will not be totally changed, it will still be within the area. But as to the exact location, there may have to be a displacement of about 100 meters.) \"Kung makapag-decide tayo for the location of San Jose Del Monte, hopefully by 2027, makakapag-operate yung Station 14,\" she added. (If we can decide on the location in San Jose Del Monte, hopefully by 2027, we can start operations for Station 14.) The construction of the 22-kilometer rail is 69.86 percent done as of May 2024. Once completed, it is expected to reduce travel time from Quezon City to San Jose Del Monte to just 35 minutes.",

      "article_body": "MANILA – The reported deployment of China's bombers in Bajo de Masinloc (Scarborough Shoal) in the West Philippine Sea is \"expected\" amid the visit of US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to the Philippines, analysts said on Saturday. Based on a Reuters report on Friday, satellite images showed Beijing deployed two long-range H-6 bombers around Bajo de Masinloc – which came ahead of Hegseth's visit. Geopolitical analyst Don McLain Gill said this just showed \"China is not happy.\" \"It is frustrated with the fact that the Philippines is stepping up in ensuring that it has the capacity to defend its sovereignty and sovereign rights and working with countries who also share the same goals and objectives,\" said Gill in a chance interview with reporters. ADVERTISEMENT \"Definitely, being an expansionist power, China will not take this happily, therefore it is a show of frustration,\" he added. Prof. Renato de Castro, an international relations expert, said Beijing's reaction is expected and is only for optics. \"Very strong talaga yung nangyari, yung joint statement ng DND tsaka ng US department na mag-deploy ng missile,\" said De Castro in a Saturday news forum. \"The Chinese are expected to react, they have to cater to their population. Ipapakita nila na tine-threaten tayo so we have to do certain actions, like sending two bombers sa panatag shpoal and expect a live fire exercise. Kumbaga pinapakita ng Tsina na 'hindi kami papasindak sa inyo,'\" he added. The Philippines, he said, is entitled to strengthen its defense system. ADVERTISEMENT ABS-CBN News reached out to the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) to confirm the presence of China's bombers in the West Philippine Sea but its spokesperson has yet to respond. On Friday, the US and the Philippines agreed that one of the key initiatives to accelerate its longstanding defense partnership is the deployment of more advanced US military capabilities in the Philippines. This includes the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS)—a mobile, ground-based anti-ship missile launcher—and highly capable unmanned surface vessels. The training and testing of NMESIS will also be integrated into the upcoming Balikatan exercises, the annual joint military drills between Philippine and US forces. Hegseth told President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. on Friday, that the two countries must stand \"shoulder to shoulder\" in the face of the threat represented by China.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — Sen. Imee Marcos has withdrawn from the Alyansa Para sa Bagong Pilipinas endorsed by her brother President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. citing differences over the arrest of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Sen. Marcos last week held a Senate hearing on Duterte's arrest and transfer to the International Criminal Court in the Netherlands. She said she will present her preliminary findings soon but said the government's actions \"run counter to my ideals and principles.\" She added: \"Thus, I cannot stand on the same campaign platform as the rest of the Alyansa.\" ADVERTISEMENT Sen. Marcos had earlier on declined inclusion in the slate, saying she wanted to be able to talk to both factions in the former UniTeam alliance. President Marcos said his sister was welcome on the slate and that the administration would support her reelection campaign. He did not mention Sen. Marcos at a campaign sortie on March 21 when he batted for the members of the administration ticket. \"As I have stated from the outset of the election period, I will continue to maintain my independence,\" Sen. Marcos said Wednesday. In the same statement, she said government resource speakers' answers — and lack of them when they invoked executive privilege and the sub judice rule — \"only gave rise to ever greater suspicion that the Constitution may have been disregarded and our sovereignty diminished by the arrest of former President Rodrigo Roa Duterte.\" Alyansa campaign manager Navotas Rep. Toby Tiangco said, \"We respect Senator Imee’s decision.\" \"We wish her luck in the campaign,\" he added.",

      "article_body": "From the annexes of the impeachment complaint filed against Duterte, which entails an issue on supposed confidential funds misuse among its seven articles, two other names have surfaced: “Pia Piatos-Lim\" and \"“Renan Piatos\". These names are similar but also somewhat different to Mary Grace Piattos, since they only have a singular \"T\" in their middle name and surname. Another name that Ortega revealed was \"Xiaome Ocho\", seemingly named after a Xiaomi cellphone model in 2018. “Grabe naman ang ‘special treatment’ sa pamilya Piattos. May Mary Grace Piattos, may Pia Piatos-Lim, may Renan Piatos. Ano bang meron sa kanila at parang qualified silang lahat makatanggap ng confidential funds?” Ortega said in a press release. ADVERTISEMENT Similar to Mary Grace Piattos and \"Kokoy Villamin\", another suspicious name that appeared last December in Office of the Vice President (OVP)'s confidential fund receipts, these new names have no records of birth, marriage, or death from the Philippine Statistics Office (PSA). “Anong klase itong confidential funds disbursement na hindi natin matukoy kung totoong tao ba ang mga tumanggap?” Ortega asked. “Public funds ito, pero parang ginamit sa isang imaginary payroll,” he claimed. The Young Gun also vowed to \"expose more members\" of what he called \"Budol Gang\", pertaining to the unique name mentioned in Duterte's receipts. “The public deserves the truth. Hindi tayo dapat pumayag na ganito na lang, na parang walang nangyari sa napakalaking budol gamit ang confidential funds,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT The OVP has yet to issue a statement about the bared additional names, although Duterte reasoned out in December that explaining what some call \"fabricated\" receipts might \"compromise intelligence operations\". The name “Mary Grace Piattos” appeared in at least one of the acknowledgment receipts (AR) supposedly submitted by the OVP to the Commission on Audit (COA) explaining its controversial 2022 confidential expenses. Its peculiarity was questioned during one of the hearings of House Quad Committee last year. The receipts were related to the ₱125 million confidential funds that were allegedly spent in just 11 days, as revealed by Marikina 2nd District Rep. Stella Quimbo. With some doubting the actual identity of Mary Grace Piattos, there were already several lawmakers who offered reward money to anyone who could provide any lead about her.",

The UPOU said its degrees “are now officially recognized for equivalency” by UAE’s Ministry of Education, which overseas Filipino workers could leverage for “career advancement and employment opportunities.” “This development will have a profound impact on the professional and economic mobility of our OFWs, enabling them to transition from high-risk, low-paying jobs to safer, more stable, and higher-income positions,” UP President Angelo Jimenez said. Prior to the accreditation, Filipinos with UPOU degrees reportedly faced challenges in career advancement since their graduate programs were not recognized by the UAE, the state university noted. ADVERTISEMENT UAE hosts some 650,000 OFWs, according to 2020 data from the Department of Foreign Affairs. UPOU Chancellor Joane Serrano vowed to expand the university’s Ventures for International and Transformative Academia program “that Filipinos around the world can avail of high-quality UP education.” MANILA -- The Manila Trial Court's recent ruling on the falsification of notary only pertains to Orly Guteza, according to the Department of Justice spokesperson Polo Martinez. This, after Martinez was asked if Sen. Rodante Marcoleta would be held liable over the falsification since he was the one who presented Guteza as a surprise witness to the Senate Blue Ribbon Committee. \"As far as the affidavit is concerned doon sa pagka-falsify niya, ayon sa Manila Trial Court, it only pertains to the accused, in that case na si Orly Guteza,\" Martinez said in DZMM TeleRadyo's Kabayan. \"Kung maiinvolve ba si Sen. Marcoleta, well I cannot speak on the senator's behalf pero basic understanding ng batas or kaso is that kung sino lang ang akusado, siya lang ang affected,\" he added. ADVERTISEMENT Martinez said the ethics committee may take action over Marcoleta's involvement with Guteza's falsification, but clarified that it is only a possibility and does not know if the body would actually conduct any disciplinary action or probe into the matter. \"I cannot speak on behalf of the Senate or of Sen. Marcoleta in this regard. We state facts here and ang fact lang is that the Manila court or a judge rendered the affidavit by Orly Guteza to be falsified,\" he said.",

PAF Major Jude Salang-oy and First Lieutenant April John Dadulla were accorded the Distinguished Aviation Cross after their FA-50 lead-in trainer fighter jet crashed into Mount Kalatungan earlier this week. “Ang morale ng PAF is in mourning right now. We are deeply saddened by this event but our mission goes on,” PAF spokesperson Col. Ma. Consuelo Castillo told reporters. “This will inspire us to do our mandate better. We hope the whole nation will join us in giving honor to the bravery and patriotism of our fallen comrades,” she said. ADVERTISEMENT Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro and Special Assistant to the President Anton Lagdameo led the military honors for the fallen pilots after the C130 plane carrying their remains arrived in Pasay City from Cagayan de Oro. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. was supposed to lead the ceremonies, but canceled hours before the event “due to an urgent matter.” Aside from the posthumous award, the pilots’ families will also receive financial assistance for interment, as well as livelihood and education packages, Castillo said. A vigil will be held for the pilots in the PAF Headquarter in Pasay for a day, before another ceremony in the Basa Air Base in Pampanga. Salang-Oy was a member of the Philippine Military Academy's \"Siklab Diwa\" Class of 2014, while Dadulla is part of the PAF’s Officer Candidate Course 'Sinaglawin' Class of 2020. ADVERTISEMENT They were on a mission to provide air support to government troops in Bukidnon with other members of their flight when they went missing, the PAF earlier said. After the crash, the PAF’s FA-50 units are placed on “administrative grounding” while investigations continue, Castillo said. “Ang directive naman ng Pangulo, as well as yung chain of command, is for a thorough investigation to be conducted,” she said. “Iche-check ang current fleet para ma-rule out ang material factor… pero kung kailangan natin sila lumipad to respond to emergencies then we will bring them back to air,” she said. The Philippines acquired the 12 FA-50 units from South Korea from 2015 to 2017 for P18.9 billion. ADVERTISEMENT “Mayroon tayong recommendation to buy another 12 aircraft but it will depend on higher headquarters,” the PAF spokesperson said. The PAF has yet to say when their investigations are expected to be completed and if the findings will be released to the public.",

While Torre decided to ignore his altercation with Avanceña, the PNP said it may file direct assault raps against her for a separate incident where she allegedly hit a cop with her cellphone.

Japan and the Philippines signed a 1.6 billion yen ($10.65 million) security assistance deal in December 2024 to boost the Southeast Asian nation's maritime security and surveillance abilities amid heightened tensions in the South China Sea.

Tarlac is home to major military bases, including one used by the Philippines and the United States for live-fire exercises during annual military drills. In a statement, the Tarlac city government said the donations in question were made by the local Filipino-Chinese business community, “a longstanding partner in our civic and charitable initiatives, in cooperation with the Qiaoxing Volunteer Group - Philippines, which identifies itself as a Filipino-Chinese charitable association.” “These contributions were accepted in good faith by the recipients thereof with the sincere intention of enhancing public service and no conditions or obligations were attached to them,” it said. ADVERTISEMENT The city government denied receiving, managing or distributing a P500,000 cash donation, saying the Filipino-Chinese group only donated P200,000 to the city government for various programs. “The same has so far been unutilized after having been deposited in the City coffers on September 18, 2023. The said donation was accepted by virtue of SP Resolution No. IX-33-486,” it said. “Furthermore it must be emphasized that these donations, given their insignificant amount, in no way influenced our decision making process in governance nor led to any substantial collaboration thereafter.” It said another P100,000 was donated to the Department of Education-Tarlac City District, which was used to procure dental kits for 606 Kindergarten learners across 19 schools. A donation of 15 motorcycles were allocated as follows: 5 to the Philippine National Police (PNP) – Tarlac Province, 5 to the Philippine National Police – Tarlac City and 5 to the Public Order and Safety Office (POSO). ADVERTISEMENT Presidential Communications Undersecretary Claire Castro earlier said there was nothing wrong with accepting donations if they are done in good faith. “However, if these donations were given with ulterior motives, then we need to investigate,\" she said. China's foreign ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said China required its citizens to abide by local laws and that civic groups spontaneously set up by citizens were not affiliated with the Beijing government. The Philippines has arrested at least eight suspected Chinese spies in recent weeks, including the four, adding to frictions between the two nations who have had a series of run-ins over disputed parts of the South China Sea.

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Coordinating Council of Private Educational Association on Saturday said it supports the Department of Education's investigation into \"ghost\" students as it stressed that the Senior High School Voucher Program has been a big help to actual learners. COCOPEA lawyer Joseph Estrada told Teleradyo Serbisyo that the association wants the voucher program protected from potential fraud through \"more efficient targeting\" of beneficiaries. \"Ang dami pong natutulungan ng Senior High School Voucher Program ng government. This year alone, more than a million ang ating subsidy beneficiaries and mayroong 4000+ na private schools participating in the program,\" Estrada said. (The Senior High School Voucher Program has helped so many. This year alone, it has more than a million subsidiary beneficiaries, with more than 4,000 schools participating in the program) ADVERTISEMENT The DepEd has an Education Service Contracting agreement with private schools for them to take in learners to help decongest public schools. The voucher program is meant to help defray the costs of private school tuition. COCOPEA said it does not know which of the private schools are among the 12 being investigated for potential fraud but said its member schools \"have consistently remained uninvolved in fraud cases.\" On Monday, DepEd said it will probe several schools allegedly defrauding the voucher program. Education Secretary Sonny Angara said they will explore legal measures against those who will be found liable. Sen. Win Gatchalian in 2024 flagged the supposed existence of more than 19,000 supposed \"ghost\" students, based on the Commission on Audit (COA)'s 2016 and 2018 reports. COA defined \"ghost students\" are those “whose absence cannot be satisfactorily explained by the school officials”, are listed under one school but attend a different school or campus, or are “listed as enrolled but have not attended classes since the start of the semester.” ADVERTISEMENT COCOPEA, however, said there are cases where the \"double billing\" happens in private schools not because of fraud but due to system challenges. \"Halimbawa, 'yung isang estudyante nag-decide siya na mag-enroll sa private school tapos nagbago ang isip at lumipat sa isa na namang private school within the billing period, talagang magkakaproblema kung sino 'yung magbi-bill,\" Estrada explained. (For example, a student may decide to enroll at one private school and decide to switch schools during the billing period. That will really cause problems on who will be doing the billing.) He stressed COCOPEA worries that the misused funds from alleged ghost students of 12 schools could significantly affect the government and the program. He also noted that the group advocates for \"quality assurance of the private schools\" participating in the program, saying better screening would help prevent \"ghost\" students. ADVERTISEMENT In the past, schools with reported irregularities in implementing and utilizing subsidies would refund the given voucher, whether the billing issue was intentional or not, he said.",

      "article_body": "MANILA -- Transport Secretary Jaime Bautista said on Thursday there would be no more extension for the consolidation of jeepneys under the public utility vehicle modernization program (PUVMP) after April 30. Malacanang announced late Wednesday that the consolidation deadline was extended until April 30. In a briefing, Bautista emphasized that this is the eight time the deadline for consolidation was extended by the government. “Hindi na kami magre-recommend ng any extension. This is the 8th time that we are extending the deadline,” Bautista said. ADVERTISEMENT Bautista said President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., just heeded the clamor of transport groups to extend the consolidation period for public utility jeepneys (PUJs). “After yesterday’s special cabinet meeting, the president and I have a chance to discuss the program and the clamor for an extension. Our recommendation for an extension was based on the number of unconsolidated drivers and operators specially here in the National Capital Region. An extension will allow them to meet the consolidation requirement,” Bautista explained. “Maraming lumalapit sa amin… Ang sabi nila hindi nila masyadong naintindihan yung programa but then ay naintindihan na nila at willing na silang mag-consolidate so yun ang hinahabol namin, yung hindi willing mag-consolidate siguro yun ang hindi nagsusuporta sa programa natin,” Bautista added. He believes that the 3-month extension is enough time for unconsolidated jeepneys to comply with all the necessary requirements. Bautista explained that although the 76 percent consolidation of transportation stakeholders is more than enough to implement the program, the extension could help the agency to improve the implementation of the PUVMP. ADVERTISEMENT “Hopefully with this extension, siguro we can increase it, siguro with 85%. With 85%, I'm very sure this will be a very successful program,” Bautista said. The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said the president’s decision to have another extension is a welcome development. “We welcomed the news from the president and the secretary….those who misled by groups in joining and who failed to make it during the cut-off time will be given this second chance to redeem themselves and join the program,” Guadiz said. According to Guadiz, the LTFRB is still open to have another dialogue with PISTON and MANIBELA, the groups opposing the program. “I was in a meeting in congress with Ka Mody [Floranda] and Manibela’s Mar Valbuena. They have agreed to visit my office and come up with a dialogue, perhaps we can still come up with a compromise - we have a clear cut requirement but we still need to talk,” Guadiz told the media. ADVERTISEMENT Bautista said single jeepney operators who still wish to join the consolidation program will be allowed to form their own cooperatives or corporations. \"Since the president extended it for 3-months, now we will allow them to form their own cooperatives or corporation,” Bautista explained. LTFRB said the consolidation will be open again to all and those jeepney operators who wishes to consolidate their units may apply in their regional offices or in the central office.",

The department made the announcement after the World Health Organization (WHO) declared monkeypox as a public health emergency of international concern, the highest alarm it sounds on emerging infectious diseases. With the declaration, the DOH said that the WHO has issued temporary recommendations to guide the response. ADVERTISEMENT These guidelines include activation of mechanisms for readiness and response, raising awareness on the monkeypox virus transmission, and intensifying detection capacity, epidemiology, and disease surveillance, among others. As cases of monkeypox were rising around the world last May, the DOH convened the Philippine Inter-agency Committee on Zoonosis (PhilCZ). Members of the PhilCZ include the DOH, Department of Agriculture (DA), Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), and their respective agencies. Technical guidelines have also been drafted, approved, and circulated for the surveillance, screening, management, and infection control of monkeypox as early as May, the DOH said. \"DOH emphasizes across all its guidelines and advisories that any individual can get monkeypox,\" it added. ADVERTISEMENT \"Hanggang sa ngayon, wala pa rin pong nakitaan sa Pilipinas na pasok sa depenisyon ng isang suspect monkeypox case. Ang itsura ay karaniwang naipapaliwanag ng ibang mga sakit na kahawig ng monkeypox, ngunit hindi nito kapareho,\" DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said. (Up to now, there has been no finding in the Philippines that fits the definition of a suspect monkeypox case. The clinical presentation is often explained by other diseases that look like monkeypox, but is not the same.) “The DOH will keep the Filipino public updated with factual information,” she added.",

      "article_body": "MANILA (UPDATED) — President Ferdinand Marcos, Jr. on Monday said there is a \"strong argument\" to extend the term of outgoing Philippine National Police (PNP) chief Gen. Rommel Francisco Marbil. Marbil is expected to retire on February 7, 2025 upon reaching the mandatory retirement age of 56. But according to Marcos, it would \"not be good\" to shake up the PNP leadership while the country is in the middle of an election period. \"There is a very strong argument that it would not be good for stability especially to change chief PNP in the middle of campaign period, and then approaching an election period,\" Marcos said in a chance interview. ADVERTISEMENT Interior and Local Government Secretary Jonvic Remulla last week said Marbil's term may be extended for another 4 months. Marcos on Monday mentioned a similar timeline. \"Pinag-aaralan namin but I think that is a very strong argument to keep him on at the very least until after the elections,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Commission on Elections (Comelec) said the plan to extend Marbil's term is subject to the President's \"absolute discretion.\" Asked if such an extension is not allowed during an election period, Comelec chairman George Garcia said: \"It's an absolute discretion of the President subject to his sound wisdom.\" ADVERTISEMENT \"May continuing authority po si President,\" he added. Comelec spokesperson Atty. John Rex Laudiangco explained that such extension is not considered a transfer, which is prohibited and would need prior approval from the Comelec \"Lumalabas po kasi yung extension po ay hindi naman 'transfer or detail whatever of any officer or employee in the civil service' na prohibition na required ang prior approval of COMELEC po to validly effect po,\" Laudiangco said in a text message. The Philippines' midterm elections is scheduled on May 12. -- with a report from Willard Cheng, ABS-CBN News",

According to Iloilo First District Rep. and former health secretary Janette Garin, Filipinos need additional protection as various omicron subvariants emerge. At present, the second booster shot is only available for health workers, senior citizens and immunocompromised individuals. \"If I want added protection, why will I be prevented if it will not create any harm? And we have enough supplies,\" she told ANC. ADVERTISEMENT \"There are expiring vaccines, there are people who want a second shot, a second booster, and actual real-world data shown advantages of having 2 boosters especially among those with comorbidities and among those 50 years old and above,\" added the lawmaker. As of June 1, the Philippines has received a total of 245 million vaccine doses, according to the National Task Force Against COVID-19. Of those, over 194 million doses have been distributed as of May 29, said the ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group, which monitors government data. Nearly 70.7 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. Of the figure, only 15 million have received additional jab. Instead of donating the expiring COVID-19 vaccines to other countries, the government should use them on the general population, a public health advocate said. ADVERTISEMENT According to Dr. Minguita Padilla, economic frontliners should also be allowed to get their second COVID-19 booster shots. The Health Technology Assessment Council has yet to decide whether to allow another booster shot for the general public. \"One of the problems we see with HTAC is they're looking for very, very solid evidence,\" Padilla said. \"But you have a pandemic like this and even the CDC in the US, they're going by the real-world data, meaning as it's happening.\" \"Sometimes overcaution can be detrimental to the public welfare,\" she added. The Philippines is currently experiencing a spike in new coronavirus infections amid the presence of more transmissible variants and the population's waning immunity.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission (PAOCC) on Wednesday said it is looking into the “possible criminal liability” of local government officials of Pasay City and Lapu-lapu City after discovering illegal POGOs in the two areas. Several South Korean POGO workers were found hiding in the basement of the Heritage Hotel in Pasay City earlier this month, while several foreign workers were rescued from a hotel in Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu last year. “We are taking a look at the criminal liability of local government unit officials, primarily those involved in the issuances of permits,” PAOCC spokesperson Winston Casio said in a Malacañang press conference. “Usually kapabayaan ito… Ang LGU ay isa sa may pinakamalaking visitorial at regulatory powers kaya hindi sapat na sabihin ng alkalde na hindi niya alam na ilegal yung kaniyang mga nasasakupan,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT Most of the raided POGOs in Metro Manila were located in the southern part of the capital region, namely in Makati, Pasay and Parañaque, the PAOCC official said. “The southern parts of Metro Manila have been identified as the location of these POGOs… [but] we do not want to politicize the matter because this is not a political matter,” he said. “This is a law enforcement problem,” he said. Casio refused to divulge details of the ongoing case investigation, but said that they are also investigating hotel workers, where POGO workers were found. The PAOCC earlier filed criminal and civil cases against former Bamban, Tarlac Mayor Alice Guo and other officials linked to operations of the mega POGO compound in the sleepy agricultural town. ADVERTISEMENT Porac Mayor Jing Capil and 10 other officials from Pampanga are also facing graft charges for their supposed ties to illegal gambling operations. As of February 14, 12 cases have been filed against POGO personalities, while 8 other cases are undergoing preliminary investigation, based on data from the PAOCC. The agency said it is preparing 13 other cases linked to illegal gambling operations in the Philippines.",

      "article_body": "MANILA -- The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board aims to come out with a resolution by April regarding the petition to increase jeepney fares, said LTFRB Chairperson Teofilo Guadiz on Wednesday. Transport groups led by the Alliance of Transport Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines (ALTODAP) sought a P2 provisional fare increase amid rising fuel prices. If granted, the fare for traditional jeepneys would go up from P13 to P15, while modern jeepney fares would increase from the current P15 to P17. ALTODAP President Boy Vargas said modern jeepney operators in particular are struggling since they are also still paying amortization. ADVERTISEMENT “Buwan-buwan nagbabayad kami dyan kasi modern (unit) yan e. May loan po kasi kami… Medyo mataas din ang konsumo (sa diesel) ng mga modern e dahil kasi may dinadala pong aircon yan,” he said. But during a hearing at the LTFRB office in Quezon City, Vargas noted that their new petition would only be temporary. “Pagbaba ng diesel, pwede naming ibaba rin yung pamasahe automatically, kasi ayaw din naming pahirapan yung mga mananakay,” he explained. Still, Guadiz said the LTFRB board would have to review the petition, especially considering that jeepney operators are already able to receive fuel subsidies whenever the benchmark Dubai crude price hits $80 per barrel. “May P10,000 po yan na fuel subsidy na binibigay namin which should act as a buffer doon sa pagtaas ng gasolina,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Kung mapruwebahan naman nila na kahit may P10,000 na fuel subsidy ay hindi pa rin po sapat yung kanila pong kinikita, then we will probably grant some of the request,” added Guadiz. The Department of Transportation earlier said that the latest tranche of fuel subsidy payouts will begin in March. Vargas however said that this is not enough. “Panandalian lang yun e. Sandali lang, ubos na rin agad,” he said. Some jeepney drivers have also complained about the disbursement process, saying it’s too slow or worse — sometimes it does not reach them at all. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, a separate group of jeepney groups have withdrawn their petition for a fare hike in consideration of commuters. “Kung anuman yung kakulangan, nakapagtitiis pa po yung aming mga miyembro,” said Deo Sotto, the National President of the Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers Association of the Philippines. Instead, they want the government to focus on bringing down diesel prices by amending the Oil Deregulation Law. “Tsaka bawasan na lang yung excise tax dahil napakataas po ng buwis natin sa fuel,” said Liga ng Transportasyon at Operators ng Pilipinas President Orlando Marquez. Guadiz said this will also be weighed when the LTFRB board makes its decision. ADVERTISEMENT “Magtataka po kayo bakit ang isang napakalaking grupo, magsasabing sapat na (ang pasahe). Pero yung ibang grupo sinasabihing hindi,” he said. The LTFRB will also need to consult first the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) on the possible inflationary effects of a fare hike.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of National Defense (DND) on Wednesday said that the government has plans in place should the tension between Taiwan and China escalate. DND officer-in-charge Jose Faustino Jr. said that the government has detailed plans and timelines should Filipinos in Taiwan need to be repatriated. Faustino said the government continues to \"closely monitor\" developments related to Taiwan and China. \"Right now, what we can do is closely monitor. We have prepared contingency if and ever worst case scenario will happen,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT He noted that other nations aside from the Philippines will be affected if the tensions rise, especially that the Taiwan Strait is considered a \"sea lane of communication.\" Faustino said the government is also preparing plans to address the possible surge of refugees, as the Philippines is Taiwan's nearest neighbor. Faustino said they are hoping the tensions between Taiwan and China will not escalate into war. But in the worst case scenario, he said the government will turn to its Mutual Defense Treaty with the United States. \"We have to honor the Mutual Defense Treaty. Nakasulat po iyan sa Mutual Defense Treaty ng 1951 sa US. But nakasaad din doon, it will still be according to our constitutional processes at hindi po ito automatic. And the same sa US,\" he said. ADVERTISEMENT Two geopolitical analysts said the Philippines will have a difficult time staying neutral amid the tensions, given the country's close ties with the US. Aside from the MDT, the Philippines also has a Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA) and Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) with the US. Since the treaty requires both countries to help each other in case of an external aggression, the Philippines would be on the side of the US, according to Professor Bobby Tuazon, Director for Policy Studies at the Center for People Empowerment in Governance (CenPEG). However, the Philippines’ stance should not depend on its defense deals with the US, but on its national interests, he said in a media forum in Quezon City. Meanwhile, Professor Anna Rosario Malindog Uy, Vice President for External Affairs of the Asian Century Philippines Strategic Studies Institute (ACPSSI), said the best thing the Philippines can do would be to not get involved in the tensions in the Taiwan Strait. ADVERTISEMENT Rather, the country must pursue a ‘genuine’ independent foreign policy and adhere to the One-China policy. “Let us be neutral,” Malindog Uy said in the same forum. “We should not be dragged into any conflict that is not our own making and we have nothing to do with.” She added, the current administration must reconsider and review its defense deals with the US. There are around 145,000 Filipinos working and residing in Taiwan. The recent visit by US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to Taiwan was seen by China as a violation of its sovereignty because it considers the self-ruled island part of its territory. ADVERTISEMENT Pelosi’s Taiwan visit angered China, which launched intensified live-fire military drills that raised fears of an armed conflict. The Philippines’ Department of Foreign Affairs had called for restraint by all parties concerned.",

Former Palace spokesman Harry Roque earlier claimed that then-President Rodrigo Duterte and Chinese President Xi Jinping struck what he called a \"gentleman's agreement\" to maintain the status quo in Ayungin Shoal, where Manila's military outpost, the rusting BRP Sierra Madre, in the West Philippine Sea is located. China has repeatedly cited the alleged deal to put the blame on the Philippines over the worsening tension in the West Philippine Sea. ADVERTISEMENT But Teodoro said Beijing was using the \"deal\" to refocus the debate away from their illegal activities in the disputed waterway. He said Filipino must not fall into China's \"trap.\" \"Let us not fall into the trap set by Chinese propaganda of refocusing the debate on a so-called promise while deflecting attention away from China's government, thereby freeing and allowing them to continue with their illegal activities in our EEZ,\" Teodoro said. READ: 'Pinamigay na niya': Duterte-Xi secret deal meant giving away Ayungin Shoal - Carpio The 100-meter BRP Sierra Madre began its life as the USS LST-821, a tank landing ship of the US Navy during World War II. The ship was later renamed the USS Harnett County and used as a floating base in the Mekong Delta during the Vietnam War. A gentleman's agreement between the Philippines and US allowed the transfer of the ship to the Philippine Navy after it was used to transport thousands of Vietnamese refugees to the Philippines. It was later renamed the BRP Sierra Madre. ADVERTISEMENT After decades of service, the BRP Sierra Madre was deliberately run aground in Ayungin Shoal in 1999 in an effort to check Beijing's advance in the contested waters. Meanwhile, Philippine National Security Adviser Eduardo Año and his US counterpart Jake Sullivan reaffirmed the alliance between the two countries following the recent incidents of harassment by China in the West Philippine Sea. The National Security Council on Tuesday said Año spoke on the phone with Sullivan the day prior, with the American official assuring and reaffirming the US’ “ironclad” commitment to the Philippines under the two countries’ Mutual Defense Treaty. “They discussed the recent spate of illegal, coercive, aggressive, and deceptive actions by agents of the China Coast Guard and the Chinese Maritime Militia in the country’s EEZ,” the NSC said in a statement. “Secretary Año expressed his appreciation for the United States’ continued assurances and reaffirmation of its ironclad commitment to the PH-US Alliance,” it added.

All of the new cases occurred in homes or on the streets. Most involved the use of illegal fireworks, the agency said. ADVERTISEMENT The new cases included 2 amputations due to illegal pla-pla lit by male teenagers who lost their fingers, the DOH added. The health department has recorded a total of 6 amputations due to fireworks this holiday season. \"Ang paputok ay hindi laruan. Maganda silang tingnan, ngunit nakamamatay na hawakan,\" the DOH reminded the public. \"Dapat magregalo ng kumpletong mga kamay at daliri sa kanilang mga anak ang bawat magulang. Ang mga ama at kuya ay dapat maging halimbawa para sa mga kabataang lalaki sa kanilang pamilya,\" it added. Filipinos typically usher in the New Year with noisemakers and fireworks supposedly to ward off bad luck and scare away evil spirits. New Year festivities are expected to ramp up as merry-goers seek to make up for lost time due to restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in the last three to four years. The interior department has urged local authorities to promote community fireworks displays and refrain from lighting up fireworks at home.",

The Philippine Institute for Volcanology and Seismology has raised the alert level in Mt Kanlaon from Alert Level 1 (abnormal) to Alert Level 2 (increasing unrest) following the eruption. This means “current unrest driven by shallow magmatic processes that could eventually lead to further explosive eruptions or even precede hazardous magmatic eruption.” At least 170 families or 796 individuals have been affected by the eruption, and have been brought to evacuation centers, the President said. ADVERTISEMENT “Patuloy ang ating mga ahensya tulad ng Philvocs, NDRRMC, at ang DSWD sa kanilang masusing pagsusubaybay at pag suporta. Namigay na tayo ng mga sleeping kits sa La Castillana, at may 13, 000 family food packs na ang naka pre-positioned sa Negros island at may karagdagang 40,000 food packs at iba pang non-food items na paparating,” he continued. Air assets are also on standby to ensure the government’s quick response, Marcos said. The Philippine leader also appealed to residents living near the volcano not to go near the 4 kilometer permanent danger zone. “Ako rin ay nananawagan sa lahat na maging mapag matyag at iwasan ang 4-km radius permanent danger zone. Mangyaring sumunod sa mga payo at tagubilin mula sa mga lokal na awtoridad,” he said.",

The Philippine leader said the possible conduct of annual joint military drills with Australia is something that they can discuss with his Australian counterparts. “And as to having yearly exercises, well, that's probably something that we can discuss. But again, we will have to assess the situation at the time and if we need to continue these exercises, then I think we will be able to agree on that.”",

MANILA — The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) wants a stricter limit on interest rates imposed by financing and lending companies. Under its draft memorandum circular, the SEC wants the maximum nominal interest rate fixed at 6 percent per month, or about 0.2 percent per day. The effective interest rate will be capped at 10 percent per month, or about 0.33 percent per day, including the nominal interest rate and all other applicable fees, like processing fees, service fees, notarial fees, handling fees, and verification fees. But this excludes penalties for late and non-payment of outstanding scheduled amounts due. ADVERTISEMENT Lending and financing companies may only charge penalties of up to 5 percent per month for late payment or non-payment on outstanding amounts due. Lending companies that break this rule will be fined P25,000 for the first offense, and P50,000 for the second offense. Financing companies, meanwhile, will be fined P50,000 for the first offense and P100,000 for the second offense. On the third offense, the SEC may impose a fine equivalent to at least twice the penalty for the second offense, but not more than P1 million. The company’s financing and lending activities may also be suspended for 60 days, and its secondary license may be revoked. ADVERTISEMENT If the offense is grave, the SEC may also suspend or revoke the company’s primary registration. The securities regulator is seeking public comments on the draft circular until November 14. SEC said it is doing this to strike a balance between consumer protection and the competitiveness of duly licensed lending and financing companies. “The number of borrowers struggling under excessive interest rates has continued to grow in recent years, as certain entities exploit the accessibility of online lending applications to trap our fellow kababayans in cycles of debt,” chairperson Francis Lim said. The SEC has been cracking down on online lending apps. ADVERTISEMENT In May, it revoked the corporate registration and financing license of Digido after it opened and operated four branches without obtaining a certificate of authority. In the same month, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of MagicPeso over abusive collection practices. It also filed criminal complaints against the operator of online lending app Easypeso for abusive collection practices. Earlier in October, it issued a cease and desist order against the operator of online lending platforms Credit Cash and Credit Peso over unfair debt collection practices. The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission has monitored some 300 online lending apps, many of which are bogus. Some bogus lenders even go so far as to issue rape or death threats to borrowers so they would pay up. Authorities, however, are facing a blank wall in going after abusive lending apps since the companies simply discard these preregistered SIM cards after promoting their services or threatening their borrowers.",

GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Friday invited South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to visit the Philippines, and sought South Korea’s help to “promote a rules-based order, a more secure and more prosperous region.” “Next year, the Philippines will chair the ASEAN summits, and I see a real opportunity for us to promote a rules-based order, a more secure and more prosperous region,” Marcos told Lee during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of this year’s Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit here. “I will express once again our deep gratitude for the deep ties that bind our two peoples from, as you have mentioned, fighting side-by-side during the war, to providing assistance in times of calamities, protecting the rights and welfare of our nationals,” he said. “I'm happy to note the steady progress of our strategic partnership. We have already reached several milestones, one of which was the bilateral free trade agreement and also our cooperation in areas of defense and security, amongst other key areas of mutual interest,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT “Before I go any further, allow me to invite you to come and visit us in the Philippines,” he added. Lee responded affirmatively and told Marcos: “I fully agree and I will try to visit the Philippines sometime soon.” The South Korean President also acknowledged the Philippines’ role in the Korean War, where some 7,420 Filipino soldiers were deployed as part of the Philippine Expeditionary Forces who fought alongside South Korean soldiers. “The Republic of Korea and the Philippines are very special friends. When we were in a national crisis, the Philippines sent its military to aid us so the people of Korea will never forget the contributions and dedication and sacrifices made by the Philippines,” Lee said. “Our two countries have maintained a very close relationship of cooperation and support, and we have mutually helped each other out over the years, but I hope that through your visit, we will be able to take that to another level and have much closer cooperation,” he said. ADVERTISEMENT The Philippines — South Korea’s oldest diplomatic partner from the Southeast Asian region — is a key destination for South Koreans who are learning to speak in English, while the East Asian peninsula is a popular choice for Filipino tourists. As of 2024, South Korea ranked as the Philippines’ 5th largest export market with exports amounting to $3.53 billion, according to data from the Malacañang. In terms of imports, South Korea is the Philippines’ 4th largest supplier, with imports pegged at 9.6 billion.

DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said the agency is coordinating with the private sector in procuring vaccines for the disease. \"Unfortunately, doon po sa mga pag-uusap, ang pinakamaagang deliveries kung sakaling makakabili tayo would still be 2023,\" she told ANC's \"Headstart\". The DOH is exploring other avenues to acquire at least a minimal amount of monkeypox vaccines, which will be first given to healthcare workers, she added. ADVERTISEMENT Three manufacturers of monkeypox vaccines have so far been identified by the agency. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) plan to purchase the jabs as a whole is still at initial stages, Vergeire said. \"With this Asean, it is still on the stage of exploratory meetings and then the whole Asean membership, these 10 countries, will be procuring as one so that we can have stocks for all of these countries. But at the initial stage pa lang po iyon,\" she added. More than 16,000 confirmed cases have been recorded in 75 countries so far this year, according to the World Health Organization. The Philippines confirmed its first case on July 29. Vergeire said the patient had since recovered from the disease, discharged from isolation and allowed to interact with other people. ADVERTISEMENT Monkeypox has long been endemic in Central and Western Africa but there have been outbreaks across the world since May. Majority of the cases globally, Vergeire said, were spread via close contact through sexual activity. Other routes include direct contact or by touching objects or fabrics used by someone who is infected. \"Just to clarify, gusto ho natin sabihin sa ating mga kababayan, kahit sino po maaaring magkaroon ng monkeypox,\" Vergeire said. \"Hindi lang po isang sector ng lipunan ang puwedeng magkaroon nito dahil iba-iba po ang kaniyang pagsalin o pagkakahawa sa ibang tao.\"",

      "article_body": "The Presidential Anti-Organized Crime Commission on Thursday noted the need for stronger policies to go against illegal Philippine Offshore Gaming Operators, adding that as many as 100 illegal POGOs are still operating in the country. Dr. Winston John Casio said this a day after PAOCC, the police and other Philippine agencies raided a massive illegal POGO hub operating in Porac, Pampanga for alleged sexual and labor trafficking. “To be honest with you, hindi namin alam kung hanggang kailan pa ito kayang i-sustain kung PAOCC lamang ang magsasagawa nito, kaya nga kami ay laging humihiling ng tulong. Kasi sa listahang ibinigay ni PAGCOR noong nakaraang taon, mayroon silang 402 na diumano’y mga kanseladong mga POGOs. Sa aming pagmamanman doon sa 402 na iyon marami pa ho, halos 100 pa rin ho ang mga operational sa mga iyon,” Casio said in a televised briefing. Casio says the PAOCC has so far raided only 4 of these illegal POGO hubs, with the tedious process of case buildup to the conduct of operations already taking them two months. ADVERTISEMENT “At the rate we are going ay hindi ho yata natin kayang tapusin ang problemang ito hangga’t hindi magkakaroon ng polisiya na magkaroon nang mas malalim at mas malakas na polisiya laban po dito sa mga scam farms na mga ito,” Casio said. The PAOCC spokesman however said that it will be up to PAOCC’s chairman, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin, whether or not to recommend to President Marcos Jr. the total ban of POGOs. “But I am certain, we are certain because he has told this several times already to us, we, in the Secretariat na lubhang nakakabahala at dapat ituloy namin iyong aming malawakang operasyon laban sa mga scam farms na mga ito at huwag kaming panghihinaan ng loob sapagkat lagi po siyang nasa likod namin bilang aming chairman at tutulungan niya kami lagi para tuluyang maipasara at matigil ang problemang ito,” Casio said. Some 157 foreign nationals and 29 Filipinos were rescued on Wednesday by the PAOCC and other Philippine agencies from the Pampanga POGO linked to human trafficking. This was the second high-profile POGO operation in Central Luzon this year, following the earlier raid of the illegal POGO facility in Bamban, Tarlac.",

So, iyan po ay pinamo-monitor ng ating Pangulo sa ating mga concerned agencies.\" ADVERTISEMENT Castro said that the President has also instructed police authorities to continue their law enforcement activities even during the Holy Week break \"Alam naman po natin na may mga pagkakataon na nagkakaroon pa rin, hindi maiiwasan na mayroong mangyayaring mga aksyon, mga krimen at hindi dapat matulog, iyan po ang direktiba ng Pangulo, hindi dapat matulog kahit Holy Week, kahit bakasyon ang karamihan; hindi dapat nagbabakasyon ang gobyerno. Patuloy pa rin po ang pagsasagawa ng mga monitoring at pagtulong sa ating kapuwa Pilipino,\" she said. The Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) and the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) have already started strengthening their safety measures and preparations for the expected influx of passengers. MARINA started its inspection of ports two weeks before the Holy Week peak season, while the PCG is set to deploy additional personnel in more vulnerable parts of Batangas Port. MARINA expects the peak season to start on April 16 or Holy Wednesday, ending on April 20 or Easter Sunday. ADVERTISEMENT Meanwhile, the Paranaque Integrated Terminal Exchange is expecting around 2.5-million passengers to pass from April 9 to 23.

      "article_body": "MANILA - A group of educators is urging government to allow some schools to continue blended learning and to train teachers better in enforcing the K-to-12 program. Based on a recent Pulse Asia survey commissioned by Sen. Sherwin Gatchalian, 44 percent of Filipinos are dissatisfied with the K-to-12 system. This is higher than the 28 percent dissatisfaction rate in a 2019 survey. The Department of Education has been \"delivering a behaviorist mode of teaching,\" or a traditional type, according to Prof. Lizamarie Campoamor-Olegario, research head of the Sequre Education Movement. \"The traditional type of teaching still tended to focus on knowing, memorizing,\" she told ANC's Headstart. ADVERTISEMENT Olegario said she did a study in 2017 where she interviewed K-to-12 teachers who gave good answers on the program's principles but performed poorly when observed. The teachers said they were only trained for a week through seminars and webinars, according to Olegario. \"I think webinars, seminars are not enough because it’s also traditional type. When I interviewed them they were able to answer the questions well,\" she said. \"I suggested in 2017 the teachers should be mentored, observed by experts.\" Education Undersecretary Epimaco Densing said he agrees that training teachers should be more extensive. ADVERTISEMENT \"Training teachers should be on a module basis, in other terms there should be a year-long program but the modules would be given in tranches,\" he said. \"Based on the assessment being done right now, it's something we expect to hear from the evaluators of the K-to-12 program.\" The DepEd reviewed the implementation of the Kinder to Grade 10 program prior to the assumption of the new administration, Densing said. Vice President Sara Duterte has since ordered the review of Grades 11 to 12, he added. \"Hopefully we’ll have the immediate results as soon as possible,\" he said. Some schools, meantime, should be allowed to continue blended learning as they do not have the capacity to implement full face-to-face classes, Olegario said. Some students can \"thrive\" in remote learning, she added. ADVERTISEMENT \"Schools should divide the total population so they can have smaller class sizes and meet them, alternately meet the students in groups so they can focus more on fewer students also,\" she said. \"We have a learning loss. This will better address the reading problem and other competency problems we have.\"",

A Chinese Navy warship was involved for the first time. - ANC, The World Tonight, December 4, 2024 GYEONGJU, South Korea — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday joined other world leaders in the 32nd Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Leaders’ Summit, where host country South Korea called for “harmony and coexistence” despite differences in national interests. South Korean President Lee Jae Myung in his opening remarks urged APEC members to “become connected and be more open” to one another so that the region — which registered 48 percent of global trade — “can go down the path of prosperity.” “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” said Lee, whose country is hosting the annual regional meeting this year. “Free trade is facing wild changes. Uncertainties are growing for the global economy and trade and investment is losing its vitality,” he said during the APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting Informal Dialogue with Guests. ADVERTISEMENT “Cooperation and solidarity is the only answer that will lead all of us to a better tomorrow. We cannot always be on the same page as each member economy may have their own interests, yet we cannot always unite with the ultimate goal of gathering strength for co-prosperity.” Lee’s opening statement comes as Manila and Beijing’s relations continue to be marred by China’s incursions in the Philippines’ exclusive economic zone despite a 2016 arbitral ruling that invalidated its sweeping 9-dash line claim in the South China Sea. This year’s APEC also marks the first time that Marcos Jr. and Xi would meet in person since January 2023, when the Filipino leader traveled to Beijing for a state visit in an attempt to amicably settle disputes in the strategic waterway where trillions-worth of goods pass through annually. The Summit is being held in Gyeongju — South Korea’s ancient capital — where consensus building has been honored for centuries, Lee said. “Our reality does not leave much room for rosy forecasts. We are all at an infliction point of rapid changes in international order,” Lee said, noting that “free trade is facing wild changes” while “uncertainties are growing for the global economy, and trade and investment is losing its vitality.” ADVERTISEMENT “[But] The Hwabaek spirit does not enforce any single idea but rather strive to achieve a harmony of different voices, exploring the path for harmony and coexistence,” he said. “The more we become connected and the more open we become to one another, the further we can go down the path of prosperity.” The Department of Foreign Affairs earlier said that Marcos Jr. is not expected to have a bilateral meeting with Xi on the sidelines of the APEC 2025, saying that this forum traditionally focuses on economic and trade issues, instead of security and defense. On October 30, Marcos Jr. told Filipinos here that he would focus on wooing investors from APEC economies to help boost the Philippines’ tech industry as the world further shifts to digitalization and artificial intelligence. Marcos Jr. has described the APEC as a “very important” meeting, underscoring that the regional bloc represents over 80 percent of the Philippines’ trade.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — The Department of Health is reviving its push to redefine the term \"fully vaccinated\" by including a booster shot against COVID-19. According to DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire, the agency is concerned with the low uptake of booster shots and waning immunity as cases of omicron subvariants increase. \"We are now again proposing to the Office of the President that our fully vaccinated definition be refined, that we will now include the first booster shot,\" she told ANC's \"Headstart\" on Wednesday. The DOH made a similar proposal to the previous administration but the plan was postponed to prioritize the reopening of the country's economy. ADVERTISEMENT In surveys conducted by the agency, it found out that Filipinos have not only gotten hesitant in getting the additional jab, they have become complacent, too. \"They are already confident with their first 2 doses and that because there are not much severe and critical [cases], so they say that enough na 'yung 2 doses nila,\" Vergeire said. Another reason cited by respondents was that booster shots are not required in offices or schools, she added. On Tuesday, the country recorded 924 additional cases of highly transmissible omicron subvariants BA.5, BA.4, and BA.2.12.1. In particular, the BA.5 subvariant is contributing to the continued increase in the number of cases, Vergeire said. But she noted that evidence suggests the omicron subvariant will not cause severe infection. ADVERTISEMENT \"So, we are very hopeful that even though cases are increasing, we can still manage and our healthcare system will not be overwhelmed,\" Vergeire added. The administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has pledged to administer COVID-19 booster shots to 23 million eligible individuals in its first 100 days. As of Monday, some 71.9 million Filipinos have been fully vaccinated. Of the figure, 16.6 million have received an additional dose, while 1.5 million have received a second booster.",

TV Patrol, Miyerkules, 4 Disyembre 2024. MANILA — The police Highway Patrol Group on Friday inspected major bus terminals in San Juan and Quezon City to check for compliance with road safety guiedlines as thousands of passengers travel for Undas. Police Col. Hansel Marantan, HPG chief, said the terminals and the buses there \"satisfied the substantial compliance” after inspection for cleanliness, license plates, and tire condition. Tires “should not be more than four or five years old, otherwise it becomes brittle and can cause accidents,” he added. He added that apart from minor violations, most terminals have shown full compliance with safety standards. “So far, everything is within expectations,” he concluded. ADVERTISEMENT The HPG has deployed around 400 personnel, including secret marshals and uniformed officers, to monitor the All Saints' and All Souls' holiday rush. “So far, we have not seen any major violations except for a few drivers who tested positive for prohibited drugs,” Marantan said. He emphasized bus drivers must exercise “extra diligence” since they are carrying dozens of passengers who depend on them for a safe trip. “If you are not in your normal state while driving, you might cause an accident,” he said. The Philippine National Police, Land Transportation Office, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority and Coast Guard have been conducting random drug tests and surprise inspections in recent days, which, Marantan said, has prompted higher compliance with safety rules. “It’s a good measure. They call it Oplan Harambe, and it’s being implemented not only in Metro Manila but also in the regions,” he said. The HPG is also working with the Department of Transportation to crack down on colorum, or unlicensed, transport.",

      "article_body": "MANILA — A ranking Philippine Navy official on Wednesday said that deterrence is not solely about weapon systems, but also encompasses other factors, such as the will of the people, military capabilities and alliances. Rear Adm. Roy Vincent Trinidad, PN spokesperson for the West Philippine Sea, was responding to questions about the possible deterrence effect of the Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System or NMESIS, which US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has vowed to deploy to the Philippines to counter China’s presence in the region. During Hegseth’s visit to Manila in March, the Philippines and the US agreed that one of the key initiatives to accelerate their longstanding defense partnership is the deployment of more advanced US military capabilities in the country. This includes the NMESIS, a high mobile coastal anti-ship missile with the ability to strike hostile surface vessels from land-based positions. ADVERTISEMENT The training and testing of the NMESIS will be integrated into the Balikatan exercises, the annual bilateral drills between Philippine and US forces, this April and May. “Deterrence is more than just one missile system; it is an integration of different elements composed of but not limited to the will of the people, military capability, national leadership, and our alliances with like-minded states,” Trinidad said in a statement. But Trinidad did not say when the NMESIS missile system is expected to arrive in the country. This year’s Balikatan exercises will run from April 21 to May 9. National democratic activist groups oppose the annual military exercises as well as the presence of foreign troops in the Philippines, saying these keep the country dependent on foreign powers and puts it at risk of being caught up in geopolitical rivalries and potential conflict. ADVERTISEMENT In a statement on Araw ng Kagitingan to commemorate the Fall of Bataan during World War II, Kabataan party-list said the Philippines should honor the thousands who died by making sure the country is not used as a staging ground for war by foreigners. “Kaya pagtalikod sa alaala ng mga bayani sa Bataan ang pagbigay daan ni [President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.] na muling gamitin ng US ang bansa natin sa pamamagitan ng [Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement] sites, [Visiting Forces Agreement] at ang Balikatan Exercises para gawing baseng pandigma muli tayo sa Asya-Pasipiko,\" she also said.

      "article_body": "MANILA -- The Department of Science and Technology has offered solutions to address bed bug infestations in wooden and metal furniture in some public facilities, including the Ninoy Aquino International Airport. The local innovations look to enhance furniture made from indigenous materials, such as rattan. DOST-FPRDI has studied various methods to protect non-timber forest products (NTFPs) against biodeterioration agents—from processing, storage, and transit. They said one method is applying wood preservatives to freshly cut and conditioned materials. Another approach involves non-chemical control methods, such as kiln drying, to achieve low moisture content and ensure proper drying of raw materials. The DOST is also researching eco-friendly ways to safeguard wood and NTFPs, one of which is through thermal modification. ADVERTISEMENT “This news may have caused apprehension towards using rattan and other non-timber forest products for furniture, but Department of Science and Technology’s Forest Products Research and Development Institute (DOST-FPRDI) would like to clarify that technologies and methods are available to prolong their service life,” said Rico J. Cabangon, DOST-FPRDI Officer-in-Charge, in a statement. According to Cabangon, bed bugs are generally attracted to the woven pattern of wicker furniture, like rattan, not the material itself. Bed bugs thrive in items with tiny cracks and crevices, regardless of the material—whether rattan, metal, cloth, or concrete. Apart from bed bugs, rattan furniture can also be infested with biodeterioration agents such as fungi, termites, and powder-post beetles or bukbok. “Rattan is one of the leading raw materials used in furniture and handicraft products. It is often combined with metals and wood to enhance its aesthetic appeal. Like any lignocellulosic material, rattan furniture and handicrafts are prone to attacks from biodeterioration agents. Proper maintenance is key to using indigenous materials like rattan,” Cabangon added. “Thermal modification uses high heat to change the kind of chemicals present in a piece of wood,\" said According to DOST Scientist Juanito P. Jimenez. \"This makes the material more durable as it becomes more stable (more weather-proof, less prone to swelling and shrinking) and less appetizing to termites.” ADVERTISEMENT DOST-FPRDI recommends minimizing exposure of treated materials to prolonged wetting to extend their service life. “We urge the public not to be discouraged in using furniture made from rattan and other NTFPs. It is a triumph of Filipino ingenuity that indigenous materials have been showcased for public use in NAIA. Through science, technology, and innovation, we can continue to take pleasure in bug-free Filipino craftsmanship,” said Cabangon. DOST's suggestions come after several cases of infestation, including bed bugs, rodents were reported at the NAIA Terminal 3. The sightings of bed bugs and rats roaming NAIA have gone viral. In response, the Manila International Airport Authority has brought in 38 new steel gang chairs at the terminal to replace the 30 old ones the MIAA pulled out for being infested with bed bugs.",

ADVERTISEMENT Tapales also reported that since the anti-OSAEM/CSAEM Act have been enacted in 2022, there has been around 200 convictions of perpetrators of such kind of child abuse. “Maaaring tumaas na rin po itong data na ito kasi if I remember correctly April 2024 data po ito. Pero marami pong cases na naka-file – 750 cases filed since 2009 noong Anti-Pornography Act pa, pero 200 convictions coming after the enactment of the Anti-OSAEC and CSEAM Act,” he said Meanwhile, several government agencies including LGUs are set to put in place a range of mandatory services for victims of child sexual abuse or exploitation, which include the provision of emergency shelter or appropriate housing, counselling, free legal services, medical and psychosocial services, livelihood skills training and educational assistance. “Ang DSWD po, DOJ ay mayroon pong niluluto ngayon at binubuo at pina-finalize na plano na magkaroon talaga ng one-stop shop na system po kung saan ang biktima ay puwedeng dalhin po diyan sa isang lugar na iyan at nandoon na lahat ang puwedeng kumausap sa kaniya, pag-provide po ng relief at intervention.

      "article_body": "Satellite images obtained by Reuters on Thursday, November 28, show a build-up of Chinese civilian vessels near contested Thitu Island, Manila’s key outpost in the South China Sea, but a senior Philippine navy officer said they are “not a cause for concern.” One of the images taken by Maxar Technologies on Monday and reviewed by Reuters shows about 60 vessels, some within 2 nautical miles of Pag-asa Island (Thitu Island), a strategically important island from which Manila monitors Chinese vessels and aircraft in the busy waterway. Vice Admiral Alfonso Torres, chief of the Philippines’ Western Command, said it was common for “maritime militia” ships to gather in the area. Manila, the Pentagon, and foreign diplomats say such vessels work with the Chinese coast guard and navy to strengthen Beijing’s presence in disputed waters. Rear Admiral Roy Trinidad, Philippine Navy spokesman for the South China Sea, also said maritime militia ships were regularly in the area, adding that Manila was aware of the vessels, which he called an “illegal presence”, but there was no need for alarm. “It’s not a cause for concern,” Trinidad said. “We don’t have to read every action and react to that… What is important for us is to maintain our posture.” Online ship trackers show that many of the vessels in the satellite photos are Chinese-registered fishing craft. The Chinese defense ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. China has never confirmed it has a militia of civilian vessels. The island, which the Philippines calls Pag-Asa, is Manila’s biggest and most strategically important in the disputed South China Sea, which is largely claimed by China and through which billions of dollars worth of goods pass each year. A 2016 ruling by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in the Hague found that Beijing’s expansive claims had no basis under international law. The build-up comes after months of clashes and rammings between Chinese coast guard and fishing vessels and Philippines ships, particularly at the Scarborough and Second Thomas Shoals. Thitu is close to a Chinese naval base and runway on Subi reef, which has sometimes served as a port for large numbers of Chinese maritime militia vessels, Trinidad said. “When you go in there (to Subi), when you go out, you will pass through the territorial sea of Pag-Asa,” he said. Regional diplomats and security analysts are watching developments closely, with some noting the Chinese vessels had their transponders on this week, allowing them to be tracked. Singapore-based security scholar Collin Koh said Beijing could be testing Manila’s reactions at a moment of domestic political tension in the Philippines. Embattled Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte on Wednesday accused President Ferdinand Marcos Jr of seeking to remove her from office, after the national police filed a formal complaint accusing her of assault and coercion. “This needs to be watched in the days ahead,” said Koh, of Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. If the militia presence continues, Koh said, it could be that China is hoping to delay Philippine construction work on the island. A new aircraft hangar is reportedly due for completion in the next few weeks, the latest in a several moves to buttress the Philippines’ presence on Thitu and improve monitoring capabilities. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – At least nine ill-gotten properties worth P72.157 billion are considered “abandoned and surrendered” in 2023 to the Presidential Commission on Good Government (PCGG). In its 2023 audit report dated April 25, the PCGG’s audit team said that these properties are not facing any contest since “ownership has finally been decided in favor of the government.” The agency, established after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship, is mandated to recover the wealth stolen by the Marcos family and individuals linked to the late dictator. His son and namesake, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., is the incumbent Philippine president. The assets and properties that were “voluntarily surrendered, assigned, or ceded or waived to the commission as ill-gotten wealth, or through settlement or after judicial determination” include real estate linked to cronies J.Y. Campos, Roberto Benedicto, Antonio Martel, Simplicio Palanca, Alejo Ganut Jr. and Jolly Bugarin. The PCGG said that its asset management department worked with several appraisal companies to determine the latest valuation of these properties. One of the high-value items are two adjoining lots in Ortigas Center, Pasig City that have an assessed value of P70.63 billion in 2023. It is where the Payanig sa Pasig Amusement Park used to stand before being replaced by Metrowalk.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr said on Thursday, December 1, that the status quo remains in the health and defense departments – two portfolios that are headed by officers-in-charge. “We just go to the process,” said Marcos in a chance interview on Thursday, December 1, when asked for updates on the appointment of officers-in-charge in his Cabinet. “So let’s be patient. Basta’t na… Ako, ang concern ko lang ‘yung kailangang gawin na trabaho, nagagawa? So far naman, nagagawa,” he added. (My concern is that if people are doing their jobs. So far, they’re doing their jobs.) At least three departments or offices headed by a Secretary are occupied by officers-in-charge: the Department of Health, Department of National Defense (DND), and the Office of the Press Secretary. “Wala pa kaming DOH. Wala pa kaming inino-nominate (We don’t have a nominee for DOH yet). Usec. Vergeire is doing a fine job,” said Marcos, referring to Undersecretary Rosario Vergeire, who was designated officer-in-charge weeks after the new administration began took over. Marcos also said he was “happy with the situation [in the DND] as it is now.” The DND administers the country’s military force and the Office of Civil Defense, an agency tasked with civil defense and disaster risk reduction. It is currently headed by former armed forces chief Jose Faustino, designated Senior Undersecretary and Office-in-Charge Still, the President did not rule out changes when 2023 rolls in. “These things are revisited especially every year at the end of the first year. I don’t think that’s any — that’s a secret to anyone that at the end of the first year, ‘yung mga ibang kandidato (the other candidates), they will now join the mix of possible nominees,” he said. There’s another department that critics and allies alike have said needs a full-time post: agriculture, which Marcos holds concurrently. The President has said that he has a checklist of things he wants to accomplish before finding an agri chief, although he did not say what were these goals. Delays and backlogs in permanent appointments – from the heads of major Cabinet posts, middle management in the bureaucracy, and non-Career Executive Service Officer (CESO) occupying CESO posts – is a major sore point in the Marcos administration. His short-lived first executive secretary, Vic Rodriguez, was criticized for being the supposed cause of the delays. Rodriguez, Marcos’ campaign spokesperson during the May elections, has since been kicked out of the President’s party for supposedly failing to accommodate their party-mates in government posts. His replacement, former chief justice Lucas Bersamin, issued a memorandum circular that expanded the powers of these interim appointments, allowing them to enter into new contracts and projects, among others. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Vice President and Education Secretary Sara Duterte, who once punched a court sheriff in a fit of rage when she was mayor of Davao City, advised teachers on Thursday, March 21, to pause when they are about to lose their cool while conducting their classes. The Vice President made the statement when asked about her reaction to a viral video of a teacher berating her students live on TikTok. “Ang una kong naging reaksiyon ay tao lang ‘yung teacher. Lahat tayo umaabot sa punto na nagagalit tayo lalo kapag na fru-frustrate tayo,” Duterte told reporters in an ambush interview in Cambodia. (My first reaction was – the teacher is just a human. We all reach a point where we get angry especially when we’e frustrated.) She said no penalties were imposed on the teacher, but added that she would be reprimanded by her regional director. “I saw her explanation. And then, I instructed the regional office that there will be no penalties for the teacher. Just to remind the teacher, if she’s angry, she has to pause. Pause the class. If she’s not angry anymore, she can resume the class. There’s a need to pause, if the teacher is angry,” Duterte said in a mix of English and Filipino. Duterte’s Zen-like advice was a stark contrast to her throwing a tantrum and punching a Davao Regional Trial Court sheriff during a demolition of houses over a decade ago in Davao City when she was mayor. The Department of Education (DepEd) said on Monday, March 18, it issued a show cause order to the erring teacher. According to DepEd order No. 40 series of 2012, child abuse in schools includes an “act by deeds or words which debases, degrades or demeans the intrinsic worth and dignity of a child as a human being.” The Vice President said that teachers are trained for psychosocial support. Students who felt anxious and stressed about the incident will undergo debriefing sessions. The DepEd has identified bullying as one of the reasons for the prevailing learning crisis and one of the factors why the Philippines performed poorly in global education assessment. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The anti-graft court Sandiganbayan has ordered the 90-day suspension of National Defense College Executive Vice President Aldrin Cuña over a graft case involving an alleged anomalous Quezon City project when he was the city’s administrator. The Sandiganbayan Third Division’s order, promulgated on April 3, takes effect immediately upon service of the directive. The court furnished Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. a copy of the six-page resolution for implementation. It directed the defense chief to inform it about actions taken in relation to the order within five days. The resolution was penned by Presiding Justice and Third Division chairperson Amparo M. Cabotaje-Tang with concurrences from Associate Justice Bernelito R. Fernandez and Associate Justice Ronald B. Moreno. Cuña’s suspension stemmed from a 2023 graft case filed against him as co-accused of former Quezon City mayor Herbert Bautista. They are accused of causing undue injury to the city government by allegedly favoring contractors Cygnet Energy and Power Asia, Incorporated despite noncompliance with documentary requirements and procedures, in violation of Section 3(e) of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. In December 2023, the Sandiganbayan gave Cuña a non-extendible 10-day period to explain why he should not be placed under preventive suspension. Cuña, however, did not file any pleading so the court declared that he had waived his right to contest the his preventive suspension “Verily, once the Information is found to be sufficient in form and substance, the court must issue the order of suspension as a matter of course. There are no ifs or buts about it,” the court said. It stressed that the preventive suspension is not a penalty and that the defendant is entitled to reinstatement and payment of salaries and benefits withheld during suspension if he is eventually acquitted. “In this case, there is absolutely no question to the validity of the subject Information. Accused Cuña is now serving as the Executive Vice President of the National Defense College of the Philippines (NDCP). Thus, his preventive suspension should now follow as a matter of course,” the court said. In the graft case, Ombudsman investigators alleged that Bautista and Cuña approved the contract worth P25.34-million in favor of Cygnet, meant for installing solar power and waterproofing systems of Civic Center Building F. Cygnet received the payment for the project despite not being entitled to it, the Ombudsman said, because it “failed to apply for and secure a Net Metering System from Meralco,” which was a mandatory requirement under the terms of reference and the supply and delivery agreement. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "BACOLOD, Philippines – Dengue cases in six provinces and two highly-urbanized cities in Western Visayas have breached 20,814 with 51 deaths as of January to August 31 this year, Department of Health in Region 6 (DOH 6), said in a virtual press conference on Tuesday, September 10. The figures are “too high” with notable increase of 264% compared to the same period of last year, which had only 5,711 with 25 deaths. The health officials also said the new cases just of last week reached 2,758. Dr. Bea Camille Natalaray, DOH 6’s program medical coordinator for emerging and re-emerging infectious disease, said the Iloilo Province topped the list for having the most number of dengue cases at 8,039 with 23 deaths. Negros Occidental followed with 3, 296 cases with 10 deaths, Capiz with 2, 104 with five deaths, Aklan – 2, 103 with three deaths, Guimaras – 1, 668 with one death, Iloilo City – 1,407 with four deaths, Antique – 1, 111 with two deaths, and Bacolod City – 1,086 with three deaths. Natalaray also said some 998 barangays in the Western Visayas have also clustering of dengue cases, and 21 were already classified as “hot spot” villages. As to the admission of dengue cases in various hospitals in the region, Natalaray said that based on their monitoring, the current rate ranges from 70 to 72% utilization. Health Undersecretary Dr. Mary Ann Palermo-Maestral told Rappler on Wednesday, September 11, however, said dengue awareness have had started to increase in the region. Aside from fogging or spraying operations being conducted by almost all local government units in the region, there were also some activities being done to drum up public awareness against dengue, she said. “Thus, two to three weeks from now, I am sure, there will be a decrease in dengue cases in the entire region,” Maestral said. Maestral still warned both Ilonggos and Negrenses not to resort to indigenous treatment of dengue fever like using extracts from tawa-tawa (wild grass) or juvenile papaya leaves. Rather, she advises the public to seek early consultation or treatment so proper cure can be administered to any dengue patients. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "DAVAO ORIENTAL, Philippines – A sharp decline in Davao Oriental’s revenue share from the national government has led to the provincial government’s decision to give up the management of a P289-million irrigation system to the National Irrigation Administration (NIA). Davao Oriental Governor Corazon Malanyaon said the province was unable to bear the system’s operating and maintenance costs due to the capitol’s reduced 2023 annual budget. The provincial government only spends an average of over P1 million annually to manage the Cateel irrigation system, but repairs and rehabilitation costs are too high for the provincial to handle, according to Emilia Barrera, the head of the local finance committee. Davao Oriental provincial board member Rotchie Ravelo, a former provincial agriculturist, said, “With our small budget, it is so expensive to run it.” The Cateel irrigation system was built nine years ago to aid rice farmers. Also known as the Aragon Dam, it was designed to water 4,000 hectares of rice fields, but currently serves only 1,600 hectares due to damage to its right canal. The provincial government’s technical team stated that the dam’s optimal economic life is only five years, making it necessary for the NIA to take over. Edito Sumile, the provincial agriculturist, said, “To really make it functional and cover an area of 4,000 hectares, it will really require a huge amount, beyond the capacity of the province to shoulder for now.” The province’s budget for 2023 is some P2.3 billion, a decrease from 2022’s more than P2.7 billion, said Vice Governor Nino Sotero Uy. The capitol’s annual revenue decline was further compounded by the economic impact of COVID-19, officials said. “Delaying the repair and turnover of the Cateel irrigation project would also delay progress in this area,” said Abel James Monteagudo, the director of the Department of Agriculture (DA) in the Davao Region. Malanyaon said the transfer of the project, which she referred to as her legacy, was necessary for the best interest of local farmers and the province’s goal of achieving food security. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) on Monday, February 17, issued an administrative order requiring mining firms to include biodiversity conservation and climate action in their social development management programs. The DENR noted in a statement on Monday, February 17, that in the past, these particular programs were not required in mining firms’ plans. Environment Secretary Toni Yulo-Loyzaga said they are also looking at “labor practices, gender equity, social services along with reforestation, rehabilitation, restoration of ecosystems to address biodiversity loss.” “The goal is to ensure that the wealth generated from mineral extraction is shared equitably, that ecosystems are protected, and that local communities gain empowerment,” Loyzaga said. Mining firms are required to come up with a five-year development program to improve the living standards of their host communities. This usually includes the construction of schools, hospitals, and housing projects. The extractive industry, associated with environmental damage, plays a critical role in the world’s transition to clean energy technologies. There is rising demand for critical minerals like copper, nickel, cobalt — used in manufacturing electric vehicles, battery storages, and wind turbines, among others. The department order requires mining companies to incorporate the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) which aim to eradicate poverty by 2030. In a statement on Tuesday, February 18, the Philippine Nickel Industry Association (PNIA) welcomed the order from the DENR, saying they have been “long…ahead of the curve” in sustainability policies. In 2023, for example, PNIA said its members invested P4.3 billion in development projects “including the planting of nearly 4.3 million trees.” “As the Philippines continues to be a major player in global nickel production, PNIA reaffirms its commitment to responsible mining practices and to advancing the SDGs,” the business group said. The UN set the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in 2015, replacing the Millennium Development Goals adopted in 2000. These include ending poverty and hunger; ensuring good health, quality education, clean water and energy; promoting decent work; building resilient infrastructure; reducing inequality; making sustainable cities and communities, among others. In 2024, the UN reported that the world was “severely off track” in achieving the SDGs. “It finds that only 17 per cent of the SDG targets are on track, nearly half are showing minimal or moderate progress, and progress on over one-third has stalled or even regressed,” said UN Secretary-General António Guterres. The report attributed delays in progress to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and armed conflicts. In keeping with its commitment as a member-state, the Philippines integrated the SDGs into the Philippine Development Plan for 2023 to 2028. Likewise, there have been efforts to encourage the private sector to align investments with the SDGs, including the UN Development Programme’s investor map launched in 2024. – Rappler.com",

Marcos was set to visit Northern Samar but the bad weather in Catarman town, Northern Samar prevented him from leaving. Instead, the president had his situational briefing with Samar local officials via zoom in Tacloban City Thursday morning, November 23. Marcos also ordered the Department of Public Works and Highways to make sure all the roads are clear for the faster distribution of relief goods for flood victims. “We are doing everything that we can. But let’s work with those who are in the evacuation centers – pati na ‘yung mg nasa bahay pa (even those still at their homes) – we have to go and make sure that they get the food packs, they get sufficient water supply,” he said. Social Welfare Secretary Rex Gatchalian assured that they have already prepared over 100,000 food packs for distribution to the affected families in Eastern and Northern Samar. The DSWD was also finalizing the list of affected families and individuals whose houses were either totally or partially damaged as the basis of the financial assistance the flood victims will receive from the government to start rebuilding their houses. Marcos instructed the Department of Agriculture to provide the necessary assistance to affected families and distribute seedlings and agricultural products. The Sangguniang Panlalawigan of Eastern Samar declared Wednesday a state of calamity over their entire province due to the persistent rainfall and massive flooding. Initial reports from Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction Management Office of Eastern Samar said 12,817 families or 48,733 individuals were affected by flooding. And three were reported injured in Jipapad town. The provincial government of Eastern Samar is continuously monitoring and assessing the damage caused by flooding and landslides in different areas of the province. Provincial Administrator Nelson Cortez said that relief goods will be sent to affected families in the province early Friday morning. Meanwhile, as of 7 pm today the DPWH Eastern Samar said the national road at Brgy. Bigo, Arteche is now passable to all vehicles, as the flood has already subsided.

      "article_type": "NewsArticle",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – In early December 2022, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. granted Naida Angping’s leave after she asked for “personal time for herself and her family.” Just a little over a month later, the former Presidential Management Staff (PMS) chief and long-time aide to the Marcos-Romualdez clan is ending the “time off” she had wanted for a plum post in Paris as the Philippines’ ambassador to France. Angping’s nomination to the post was forwarded to the Commission on Appointments on Tuesday, January 17. According to the Commission on Appointments, she was appointed on January 13, 2023. She has not held a diplomatic post before this. Angping, if confirmed, will take the place of Ambassador Junever Mahilum-West, a career diplomat who had only been appointed to the post in October 2021. Mahilum-West herself announced she was leaving the post on Thursday night, January 11 (Manila time), through a public post on Facebook. “Enjoyed Paris too briefly,” Mahilum-West said, adding her next assignment would be in Vancouver, Canada. The Philippines currently has a consulate in Vancouver, which had been led by another career diplomat, Maria Andrelita Austria. Austria was recently confirmed as the Philippines’ ambassador to Canada in December 2022. She will hold office in the Philippine embassy in Ottawa. Angping is no stranger to politics, especially in relation to the President’s family. A former Manila congresswoman, she was a long-time aide to the late Benjamin “Kokoy” Romualdez, the father of House Speaker Martin Romualdez. Kokoy is the brother of former first lady Imelda Marcos, the President’s mother. When the then-Marcos transition team first announced Angping’s appointment as PMS chief, they hyped her experience as aide to the late Kokoy Romualdez, who was once the country’s envoy to the United States, China, and Saudi Arabia. She was also his aide when Kokoy Romualdez was Leyte governor. During the 2022 campaign, Angping served as Marcos’ “disbursing officer,” the President himself said in a leaked video of his speech at his victory party with campaign staff. That she was picked to head the PMS – an office tasked to help the President make well-informed decision, follow-up on tasks assigned to key officials, and set the agenda for Cabinet meetings – isn’t surprising, given her ties to the Marcos-Romualdez clan. But mere months in her new role, there was also talk among Malacañang insiders that the PMS chief was not performing, and was frequently absent, save for her appearance in Marcos’ public events. Her leave came after her husband Harry Angping, himself a former legislator, was allegedly caught harassing a staff member of a Bangkok hotel where Marcos and his delegation were billeted during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Bangkok. The Palace then – and even until now – refused to comment on the reports. Only a high-ranking official, speaking only on background, denied the supposed arrest of the PMS chief’s husband. Thai police denied the arrest as well. Prior to Angping’s appointment as ambassador, Malacañang was mum on her status, even as a new executive order “streamlined” the offices under the Office of the President. – with reports from Sofia Tomacruz/Rappler.com",

We want restitution.”) The namesake and father of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. declared martial law half a century ago. Ferdinand E. Marcos signed Proclamation No. 1081 and only lifted martial rule after nine years in 1981. For almost a decade, the period was marked by thousands of killings, imprisonments, torture, and human rights violations. Human rights groups, women and environmental activists, representatives of farmers, jeepney drivers, and students continue to denounce the many human rights violations and enforced disappearances that happened during Martial Law. “Nagniningning ang pakikibaka ng mamamayan mula noong diktadurang Marcos hanggang sa kasalukuyang Marcos,” Cristina Palabay, secretary-general of human rights organization Karapatan, said on Thursday. (The struggle of the people continue to shine from the Marcos dictatorship until the current Marcos administration.) The 51st anniversary coincides with Marcos’ second year in office, already beset by problems such as the rising prices of basic goods, food security. Malacañang did not release a statement on the anniversary. In other parts of the Philippines, such as in Baguio, Cebu City, Tacloban, groups also staged pockets of protests. Among the current issues harking back to the terrors of Martial Law was the recent disappearance of two environmental activists Jonila Castro and Jhed Tamano. Castro and Tamano recently surfaced after appearing in a presser led by the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict, where they said they were abducted by the military. Palabay, who was one of the individuals who sounded the alarm on the reported abduction of two environmental activists, said much has to be learned from the women who “fight against all forms of machismo and oppression.” “Ang hamon sa atin ay maging kasing tapang ni Jonila at Jhed.” (The challenge for us is to be as brave as Jonila and Jhed.) The Marcos era was marked both by the rise of many youth activists, and concurrently, the many disappearances of those critical of the government. Huge canvases of the faces of killed Martial Law activists line one part of the plaza. Among them are student leaders Liliosa Hilao, Emmanuel Lacaba, and Lorena Barros. — Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) spent P3.336 billion in 2022 on garbage collection, nearly double compared to what it shelled out in 2017. This is based on the agency’s environment/sanitary services expenses, which pertain to the “payment of fees to several entities contracted by the MMDA to collect garbage in various areas of Metro Manila.” In 2017, MMDA spent P1.764 billion for garbage collection, which rose to P1.990 billion in 2018. The MMDA spent P2.873 billion and P3.217 billion, in 2020 and 2021, respectively, for garbage collection. The agency’s expense for garbage collection breached the P3 billion mark in 2021. Although garbage collection is primarily the responsibility of local governments in Metro Manila, the agency is responsible for paying the tipping fees in sanitary landfills, MMDA acting chairperson Don Artes said in an Inquirer article. A tipping fee, also known as a gate fee, refers to the payment required from individuals or entities when they dispose of waste in a landfill. This fee is calculated based on the weight of the waste per ton. For nearly two decades since 2002, the tipping rates for waste disposal in landfills remained unchanged at P171 per cubic meter. In 2018, three contracted landfills – San Mateo sanitary landfill; International Swims Incorporated in Rodriguez, Rizal; Phileco at the Navotas landfill – sent a letter requesting a 100-percent increase in tipping fees. Their reasons included the rise in gas prices and the peso-dollar exchange rate. The MMDA sought additional funds from the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) in 2019 to accommodate the increase, and the DBM approved a 50% hike, considering it a reasonable adjustment. As a result, the tipping fee rose from P171 to P257 per cubic meter. Artes clarified that this increase was not due to higher expenditures but rather the approval granted by the DBM to pay 50% more in fees. He also cited the increase in the volume of waste coming from food, and packaging from online shopping. Artes mentioned that while two of the contracted landfills could still accommodate waste, the one in Navotas may reach its full capacity within two to three years. To address the growing trash problem in Navotas, the MMDA is currently studying waste-to-energy conversion, with plans to complete the study within the year. The estimated waste generated in Metro Manila has been increasing through the years as its population continues to rise, according to data from the Department of Environment and Natural Resources- Environmental Management Bureau (DENR-EMB). In 2019, DENR-EMB estimated that Metro Manila produced 9,333 tons of waste per day. From 2010 to 2019, Metro Manila was highest producer of waste in the country, except in 2016 and 2017. Since the enactment of the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act over 20 years ago, solid waste generation in the country has consistently risen from 9.07 million metric tons in 2000 to 16.63 million metric tons in 2020. – Rappler.com",

Wala pong mangyayari. Talagang mananatili yung Speaker sa pwesto nya. (It will never happen to Speaker Romualdez. He will remain as Speaker of the House.)” He said the reason is the closeness of Speaker Romualdez and his cousin President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. Alvarez, the representative of the 1st District of Davao del Norte, refused to speculate on why Vice President Sara Duterte left her political party LAKAS-CMD. “Sa ngayon, mahirap mag speculate, pero definitely cause and effect yan,” Alvarez said.

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said there was a 30% increase in dengue cases in the country since the rainy season began in May. The DOH provided the following data on dengue cases in the country from May 19 to June 19: “The DOH is cautious in interpreting case counts especially as regards the most recent tally (June 16 to 29) as there may be incoming late reports,” the DOH said in their statement on Tuesday, July 16. The department has identified seven regions with increasing dengue cases: Mimaropa, Cagayan Valley, Western Visayas, Ilocos Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, and the National Capital Region. From January 1 to June 29, 90,119 cases have been tallied nationwide and 233 dengue-related deaths were recorded. This year’s tally of infections is so far 17% higher than the 75,968 infections recorded in the same period in 2023, which saw 291 deaths. The DOH said weekly case numbers in 2024 were higher than infections from January 1 to May 11, 2023. However, weekly cases from May 12 to June 29 either went below or just above the recorded number of infections in the same period in 2023, thanks to efforts of local government units. The DOH reminded the public to be cautious about the breeding waters available to mosquitoes. “Dengue cases are rising as expected due to the rainfall, which allows more water to pool and be stagnant,” the department said. “Left unchecked, Aedes aegypti mosquitoes responsible for spreading dengue will breed in these stagnant pools of water.” Dengue is mostly transmitted through a mosquito bite. However, one can also get infected through maternal transmission, blood products, organ donation, and blood transfusion. Symptoms of infection include having high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands, and rashes. These symptoms typically appear around 4 to 10 days after getting infected. As the country braces itself for more rainfall, now that the state weather bureau has triggered the La Niña Alert, the DOH also reminded the public to take the following steps to protect themselves: – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "PAMPANGA, Philippines – Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG) Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr., on Monday, May 20, announced that Bamban Mayor Alice Guo will be stripped of her control and supervision over the Philippine National Police (PNP) within her jurisdiction. Abalos said he has instructed the National Police Commission (Napolcom) to initiate proceedings to revoke Guo’s powers over the local police after finding sufficient grounds to do so. “I have instructed Napolcom to initiate proceedings for the withdrawal of the mayor’s deputization,” said Abalos. “This means after this investigation, with sufficient grounds, we would withdraw the deputization of Mayor Guo as the consequences of the privileges attached are revoked immediately, including its control and supervision of its local police,” Abalos added, in a mix of Filipino and English. Napolcom told Rappler that they will begin procedures also on Monday. DILG Undersecretary Juan Victor Llamas said they have already filed their fact-finding report with the Office of the Ombudsman and added that they can also convert the report into a formal complaint upon request. “It’s just a matter of verifying under oath,” Llamas said during a press briefing held at Camp Crame on Monday. Llamas did not specify the details of their recommendation “out of deference to the Ombudsman.” However, he said, they have found serious legal implications on the case of Guo and other local officials in Bamban. Abalos said they have recommended the suspension of Guo to the Ombudsman for grave misconduct and gross negligence of duty in relation to issues surrounding Philippine Offshore Gaming Operations (POGOs) in Barangay Anupul, Bamban, Tarlac. Guo is currently under scrutiny over her alleged links to two raided POGOs in Tarlac, including her suspicious background and identity which raised doubts about her citizenship following the Senate hearing held last May 7. The Office of the Solicitor General has also launched a probe to find information that could facilitate the filing of a quo warranto petition against Guo. While it is the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation (Pagcor) that approves all POGOs, Abalos said it is still up to the local government units to allow their operations in their respective areas. Abalos reiterated that the DILG does not have the power to suspend, dismiss, or reprimand elected public officials. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Education (DepEd) announced on Monday, April 7, that it is granting teachers a 30-day “uninterrupted” and “flexible” vacation. Teachers can schedule their break between April 16 and June 1, either continuously or in staggered intervals. The DepEd set the last day of classes for the current school year as April 15. “This break is a well-deserved opportunity for our learners and teachers to relax after a long academic year. I hope they spend this time wisely, unwinding with their families and loved ones, and return to work energized for the new school year,” Education Secretary Sonny Angara said. During their break, teachers are not required to participate in any Performance Management Evaluation System (PMES) activities. They can submit their electronic Individual Performance Commitment and Review Form (eIPCRF) by the end of the first month of the next school year. Teachers applying for promotion may submit the required performance evaluations before the last day of classes. The DepEd also said any professional development activities are voluntary and should be scheduled outside the declared vacation period. “Teachers who engage in these activities will earn Vacation Service Credits (VSC) on top of the 30-day limit,” the department said. Teachers can also visit schools and participate in activities such as the May 2025 elections and sports events during their 30-day vacation. School heads are not covered by the vacation benefits, “as they are responsible for managing the school during the break.” But they are still entitled to vacation and sick leave credits. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "CEBU, Philippines – The Cebu provincial government said Monday, April 3, it would file more complaints against personnel of the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) for going against the province’s policies in dealing with the African swine fever (ASF) outbreak. The provincial government earlier sued BAI for abusing its authority and violating Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991 by continuously implementing hog culling and color-coding of ASF-marked areas. Legal consultants of the provincial government said that the complaints would now include violations of Republic Act No. 3019 or the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act after BAI released statements that declared 10 new ASF-marked red zones in the province. “These statements, the effect of these can present then injury against our hog industry, especially our backyard hog raisers,” provincial legal officer Donato Villa said. In previous reports, Cebu Governor Gwen Garcia deemed BAI’s practices as detrimental to the province’s P11-billion hog industry. On the other hand, experts from the Philippine Veterinary Medical Association (PVMA) said that these actions were internationally accepted and mandated by the Department of Agriculture. In response, Garcia criticized the PVMA’s statements for only citing circulars that held no ground against the local government’s autonomy. “Whether you’d be a national or an international association, you cannot infringe upon a local government unit’s territorial powers, as very expressly contained in the Local Government Code,” Garcia said in a statement. “On the part of the province, we have established much stringent and a very grassroots level approach in solving this crisis,” said capitol consultant on legal matters Ben Cabrido, citing the powers of LGU under RA 7160. Under Paragraph 5 (v) of Section 468 of Republic Act 7160 or the Local Government Code of 1991, LGUs can approve measures and adopt quarantine regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases within its territorial jurisdiction. On March 21, Garcia issued Executive Order No. 10-2023, lifting all ASF border control measures in the province and nullifying the color-coding scheme. A day later, Garcia issued Memorandum No. 8-2023, allowing only province-approved veterinarians to conduct ASF testing on hogs. “We view the culling policy as arbitrary and violative of the due process clause of our constitution,” Cabrido said. Rory John Sepulveda, also a legal consultant of the provincial government, said that if BAI would like to continue issuing statements, hog culling, and color-coding of ASF-marked areas, the Cebu provincial government would file more cases against them. During the press conference, the governor also called out officials who accused provincial veterinarian Dr. Mary Rose Vingcoy at the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC) of allegedly “committing unethical practices”. “Back off…Do not meddle with our position, which our own provincial veterinarian has adopted, belonging as she does to the Cebu Provincial Government,” Garcia said. – Rappler.com",

In a statement, the PCG said the three-story building “will have advanced maritime domain awareness technology such as radar, automatic identification, satellite communication, coastal cameras, and vessel traffic management.” The new structure was built after Super Typhoon Odette completely damaged the original station in December 2021. Only the Philippine flag stood where the old station once was. Admiral Ronnie Gavan, commandant of the PCG, said the station’s systems would “significantly enhance the PCG’s capability to monitor the movements of Chinese maritime forces, as well as public vessels and aircraft,” according to a PCG release. The station could not have come at a more crucial time. The PCG is among the government agencies which has to deal with China’s aggressive actions in the West Philippine Sea. Pag-asa or Thitu Island is the largest of the features administered by the Philippines in the Spratlys, an archipelago whose features are claimed by several countries, including China and the Philippines. Pag-asa is the farthest island territory of the Philippines and is located beyond its exclusive economic zone, or more than 200 nautical miles from its territorial baseline. The Philippines has occupied and administered Pag-asa island since 1971. In 1978, the municipality of Kalayaan on Pag-asa island was official established through a presidential decree. Present during the inauguration of the structure were National Security Adviser Eduardo Año, Presidential Adviser on the West Philippine Sea Andres Centino, Department of Transportation Undersecretary for Maritime Elmer Sarmiento, Department of Energy Undersecretary Giovanni Carlo Bacordo, Armed Forces of the Philippines Western Commander Vice Admiral Abeth Carlos, and other members of the National Task Force for the West Philippine Sea, said the PCG. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines has recorded its first case of monkeypox, the Department of Health (DOH) announced on Friday, July 29. DOH assistant spokesperson Beverly Ho made the announcement during the televised Malacañang press briefing. “The DOH has detected the first confirmed case of monkeypox in the country,” Ho said. The case involves a 31-year-old Filipino who arrived from abroad last July 19. Ho said the case had prior travel to countries with documented monkeypox cases. The case was tested via RT-PCR done at the Research Institute for Tropical Medicine on July 28. The case has been discharged, and is undergoing strict isolation and monitoring at home. Ho said that 10 close contacts were traced – three from the same household are currently in quarantine. Ho said that close contacts are not exhibiting any symptoms. “All have been advised to quarantine and are being monitored by the department,” Ho added. Monkeypox is a virus that causes fever symptoms as well as a distinctive bumpy rash. It occurs primarily in the tropical rainforest areas of Central and West Africa but has been occasionally exported to other regions, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The DOH urged the public to continue observing minimum health standards, noting that the viral disease can be transmitted through close contact with an infected person, animal, or contaminated materials. Ho added that initial investigation of recent monkeypox cases in other non-endemic countries also indicate potential transmission through sexual contact. “It spreads mostly by intimate sexual contact with those who have rashes or open lesions. It’s not like COVID-19 that spreads through air,” Ho said. The DOH spokesperson said that they are “not divulging any more of the clinical information because that’s all within the purview of the specialist looking at them.” On July 23, the WHO declared monkeypox a global health emergency. WHO Director-General Tedros Ghebreyesus said the spread of the disease made him decide that “the global monkeypox outbreak represents a public health emergency of international concern.” Public health emergency of international concern is the highest alert level declared by WHO. It signals that a health emergency requires an international coordinated response. It motivates countries to devote resources, activate public health responses, and work across borders on vaccines or other medical treatments. Monkeypox is usually mild. It has two main strains: the Congo strain, which is more severe – with up to 10% mortality – and the West African strain, which has a fatality rate in about 1% of cases. The UK cases have been reported as the West African strain. Symptoms of monkeypox include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, which may lead to a range of medical implications. — Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) is at a standstill in its efforts to collect millions in unpaid foreshore leases from the Oroquieta City government while a court weighs in on a foreshore land ownership dispute it has with the local government. A ruling this week from the Commission on Audit (COA) halted DENR’s claims of over P2.436 million in back rents. The DENR-Northern Mindanao’s petition hinges on seven foreshore lease agreements signed in 2003, granting the city government authority to use foreshore areas across several barangays. City hall, however, ceased payments after the first year, leading to years of accumulating debt, now calculated by the City Environment and Natural Resources Office at over P2.437 million. The legal impasse leaves the foreshore areas – and the funds at stake – in a limbo, awaiting judicial clarification on who truly owns the areas in question. COA Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba, along with Commissioners Roland Pondoc and Mario Lipana, said the DENR’s claim came prematurely, citing a declaratory relief petition pending before the Oroquieta City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 12. “This Commission dismisses the petition for being premature pending the resolution of the petition for declaratory relief. This claim is prematurely filed and not yet ripe for adjudication by this Commission,” read part of the COA ruling. At the center of the issue lies a legal debate over whether the foreshore areas fall under DENR’s domain or if they were ceded to Oroquieta based on Republic Act 5518, the city’s charter. The foreshore lease contracts, signed on January 31, 2003, covers a foreshore area in barangays Poblacion, Poblacion II Lower Loboc, Tabuc Norte and Sur, Canubay, San Vicente Bajo, and Mobod. Based on the agreements, the city government was supposed to pay an annual rent during a 25-year period. The DENR’s civil case seeks clarity on whether the 1969 legislation, which vests ownership of public lands in Oroquieta City, extends to foreshore areas. The outcome of the case is crucial for the DENR, whose claim was filed with COA in 2021 to compel the local government to fulfill its lease obligations. Oroquieta officials have argued that the RTC ruling on ownership will have to be made first before the contracts become enforceable. For now, COA has dismissed the petition, concluding that any adjudication on DENR’s claims remains “premature pending the resolution” of the court’s decision on ownership. “Apparently, there is an issue as to the ownership of the foreshore area which is already subject of a pending petition for declaratory relief before the RTC-Branch 12. Thus, it is appropriate for the declaratory relief to be resolved first for a judicial determination on the issue of ownership over the foreshore area,” the COA stated. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — The administration’s Alyansa para sa Bagong Pilpinas is set to stage its “final rallying cry” in the home turf of one bet whose numbers have been wanting: Mandaluyong City. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. is set to join his slate for a campaign rally along Nueve de Febrero Street in Mandaluyong City, the bailiwick of Alyansa senatorial bet and former interior secretary Benhur Abalos, on Friday, May 9. The city’s incumbent mayor, Ben Abalos, is the Senate candidate’s father. Benhur’s wife, Carmelita “Menchie” Abalos, is the incumbent vice mayor. Traffic advisories from the local city government advised motorists that Martinez, Nueve de Febrero, and New Fabella Road will be “closed to traffic for a political event” from May 8 to 9. Alyansa is an 11-person slate composed of the following candidates: The slate used to be composed of 12 persons, but reelectionist Senator Imee Marcos, the sister of the President, exited the slate after the arrest of Duterte. Of the 11, eight to nine are almost constantly part of the list of candidates statistically likely to make it on May 12. Depending on the survey, Abalos, Tolentino, Pacquiao, and Villar have seen themselves slip out of the so-called “Magic 12.” Nueve de Febrero is a site where Mandaluyong celebrates its liberation and founding day. “From the first rally in Laoag to the final stage in Mandaluyong, the message has been the same — Filipinos want a Senate that delivers for them,” said coalition campaign manager Navotas Representative Toby Tiangco. Alyansa had kicked off its national campaign in Laoag, Ilocos Norte, the bailiwick of Marcos and his clan. Marcos has joined 16 of the slate’s rallies — only missing a sortie in Pangasinan because he was in the Vatican for the funeral of Pope Francis. The President also joined his candidates in Cebu for a One Cebu rally hosted by Governor Gwen Garcia. Marcos, as chief campaigner of his 12-turned-11-person slate, has painted the elections as a choice between his administration and a “pro-China” and “bloody” Philippines under former president Rodrigo Duterte. Yet his bets have been careful not to upset the base of either clan, even after the impeachment of Vice President Sara Duterte and her father’s arrest. The Villars had been vocal of their disapproval over Duterte’s arrest. Camille, who is trying to be the fourth Villar senator, has skipped several of their sorties after former president Duterte’s arrest. Her absence continued after getting the endorsement of Vice President Duterte. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. has named former cop and judge Jaime Santiago as the new National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) director, Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin confirmed on Friday, June 14. Santiago served as a Manila Regional Trial Court (RTC) judge. Before he joined the judiciary, the new NBI director was a cop under the Manila Police District. He was known for being a sharpshooter in the Manila police. He replaced Medardo de Lemos, who was picked by Marcos to lead the NBI in 2022. De Lemos, a long-time career official, retired from service. Santiago took his oath before Bersamin on Friday morning. Aside from serving in Manila RTC, Santiago also had a stint as a presiding judge in Tagaytay City RTC. He also served as a judge of the Manila Metropolitan Trial Court, according to Santiago’s profile from the Philippine Judicial Academy. For three years, from October 2003 to December 2006, he was an assistant city prosecutor under the Department of Justice. The new NBI director was also the former deputy executive vice president of the Philippine Judges Association and former president of the Metropolitan and City Judges Association of the Philippines. As a cop, Santiago served as the deputy chief of the MPD’s Special Weapons and Tactics team. A decorated cop, the new NBI director received several awards such as the senior non-commissioned officer of the year of the then-Western Police District, as one of the Ten Outstanding Policemen of the Philippines, and an Act of Heroism Award given by the National Capital Region Police Office. Later, his life story made it into the big screen through the movie titled SPO4 Santiago Sharpshooter, portrayed by Senator Bong Revilla. Santiago obtained his law degree from Manuel L. Quezon University in 1993, and passed the Bar Examinations the following year with a score of 81.65%. The new NBI director was also a criminal law professor at the Philippine College of Criminology and the Emilio Aguinaldo College. – With reports from Dwight de Leon/ Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. sidestepped questions regarding his insistence not to say sorry for the atrocities committed during the Martial Law regime of his late father, the dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos. During the Foreign Correspondents’ Association of the Philippines (FOCAP) presidential luncheon on Monday, April 15, a reporter asked Marcos, “Why have you resisted issuing an apology for the atrocities committed during Martial Law under your father’s rule, and will you continue doing so as president?” “I don’t think it’s a duty for a president to be involved. That is a personal matter for the Marcos family,” he answered. “My role as president is more important right now than my role as a member of the Marcos family.” The reporter, seemingly unsatisfied with the answer, threw a follow-up at Marcos, “So will you apologize as president of the Republic in behalf?” “That seems highly contrived. Who is apologizing to whom?” Marcos replied, after which the subject has been dropped. Marcos, in the past, dismissed the idea of saying sorry for the sins committed by his father. “Will I say sorry for the thousands and thousands of kilometers [of roads] that were built? Will I say sorry for the agricultural policy that brought us to self-sufficiency in rice? Will I say sorry for the power generation? Will I say sorry for the highest literacy rate in Asia? What am I to say sorry about?” Marcos Jr. said in a 2015 interview. The presidency of Marcos Sr. from 1965 to 1986 became among the darkest chapters of Philippine history. His declaration of Martial Law in 1972 allowed him to stay in power beyond the two-term limit imposed by the 1935 Constitution. That era was marked by widespread corruption in government, suppression of various freedoms, and human rights violations. Amnesty International said 70,000 people were imprisoned, 34,000 were tortured, and 3,240 were killed from 1972 to 1981. After the 1986 EDSA People Power Revolution booted out Marcos Sr. and left his family no choice but to go intoexile in Hawaii, the succeeding government formed a body tasked to go after their ill-gotten wealth. As of 2021, the Presidential Commission on Good Government said P170 billion have been recovered but they are after P125 billion more. The Marcos family, however, has successfully reintegrated themselves in Philippine politics after the Corazon Aquino government allowed them to return home in 1991 to face the legal challenges against them. In 2022, Marcos Jr. won the presidential election in a landslide vote, with the help of what critics said was a well-oiled disinformation campaign to rehabilitate the family’s image. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will visit Australia not once but twice within a seven-day period from the last week of February to the first week of March. The first trip will be a state visit, while the second one will be for his participation in a special summit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). Here’s what you need to know. Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) spokesperson Teresita Daza said on Tuesday, February 27, that Marcos will be in Canberra from Wednesday to Thursday, February 28 to 29, as a guest of the Australian government, upon the invitation of Australian Governor-General David Hurley. He will deliver a speech before the Australian Parliament during his time there, joining other heads of state who have addressed the country’s legislative body in the past – the United States’ Barack Obama and George W. Bush, China’s Xi Jinping, Britain’s Tony Blair, Japan’s Shinzo Abe, and Indonesia’s Joko Widodo. “He is expected to convey a shared vision and future with Australia under the ambit of the strategic partnership and informed by common history, long-standing people-to-people ties, and mutual adherence to the rules-based order and international law,” Daza said. Marcos will also sit down with senior Australian officials to discuss defense and security, trade and investments, multilateral cooperation, and regional issues, according to a press release of the Presidential Communications Office (PCO) on Saturday, February 24. “Similarly, the visit will witness the signing of new agreements in areas of common interest to complement the already robust cooperation with Australia and expand engagements for mutual capacity-building,” the PCO release also read. Marcos will fly home to the Philippines after his two-day state visit. Four days later, Marcos will again be back in Australia, but in a different city. Marcos will mingle with other Southeast Asian leaders in Melbourne for the ASEAN-Australia Special Summit, an event that will commemorate 50 years since the regional bloc established formal relations with its oldest dialogue partner. His schedule is as follows: The South China Sea dispute is also expected to be raised during the summit. According to the DFA, the President himself may thank the Australian government for continuously recognizing the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2016 arbitral award that ruled in favor of the Philippines and against China’s all-encompassing claim over the vast waterway. The DFA said documents that are expected to be produced from the summit include: The Philippines will also hold bilateral talks with Cambodia and New Zealand. Manila will take part in these organized working-level events as well: There are 408,000 Filipinos in Australia as of 2022, making the migrant community the fifth largest in the Land Down Under. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "NEGROS OCCIDENTAL, Philippines – Rising temperatures prompted emergency responders to move to ensure the protection of over 5,000 Kanlaon Volcano eruption evacuees sheltering in makeshift facilities in La Castellana and La Carlota City. As temperatures climbed, Kabankalan Mayor Benjie Miranda and Himamaylan Mayor Raymund Tongson suspended all classes – public and private – at all education levels on Thursday, March 6, after the state weather bureau forecast that the temperature would feel like 40 degrees Celsius in some parts of Negros Occidental. In EB Magalona, Mayor Marvin Malacon suspended only afternoon classes. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) was right – the heat index was 40 degrees around 1 pm Thursday, according to Raul Fernandez, head of Task Force Kanlaon. Fernandez said he instructed all Regional Incident Management Team responders to ensure that all 13 evacuation centers in La Castellana and La Carlota had adequate ventilation to prevent health issues as temperatures rise this March. “I’ve told them to follow protocols in assisting the Kanlaon evacuees amid hot temperatures. I told them too to ensure that each evacuation center must have an ample supply of drinking water which is badly needed,” Fernandez added. On record, La Castellana still has nine active evacuation centers for its 4,400 remaining evacuees; La Carlota has four for 1,500 people, while Bago City has none. Bago evacuees have all been transferred to a relocation site in Barangay Napoles. Fernandez said that part of their mandate is to look after the health of the Kanlaon evacuees amid challenging conditions as temperatures rise. Since March 1, Task Force Kanlaon has been tracking weather conditions. Daily forecasts indicate that a high heat index – a measure of how hot it feels when humidity is factored in with the actual air temperature – is expected over the coming weeks. “We want to ensure that no evacuee will fall ill while at the evacuation center just because of the heat,” Fernandez said. Workers from the Department of Health in the Negros Island Region were also on alert because of the threat posed by the scorching heat. Dr. Girlie Pinongan, provincial health officer, called on residents to take precautions. PAGASA earlier advised people in Negros Occidental to take “extreme caution.” Pinongan said residents should stay cool indoors and avoid strenuous outdoor activities. She also urged Negrenses to immediately call emergency services or go to the nearest health facility if heat-related illnesses occur. Fernandez said all response mobility assets of the Office of Civil Defense and Task Force Kanlaon are ready for deployment, and medical supplies are available to respond to emergency situations. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "GENERAL SANTOS CITY, Philippines – Police have blamed a group of the Bangsamoro Islamic Freedom Fighters (BIFF) for the August 30 ambush that killed the police chief of Ampatuan town in Maguindanao province and his aide. Authorities said the ambush was the handiwork of a group led by one Abdulnasser Sabtulah Guianid and Guipar Abdulkarim a.k.a. Commander Boy Jacket, and composed of Sala Tunda, Johari Abdulbasser Guinaid, Phepe Saptulah, Abdulrah Sapal, and Bobot Kamsa. The group is known as the Karialan faction of the BIFF. Bangsamoro Local Governments Minister Naguib Sinarimbo assured that BARMM’s officials were helping the police in bringing the group behind the ambush to justice. Sinarimbo said BARMM Senior Minister Abdulraof Macacua, who is also the chief of staff of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), has instructed their ground commanders to help in pursuing the suspects. The revelation that a BIFF group was involved came even as a document surfaced about an alleged intelligence report that supposedly alerted authorities that Ampatuan police chief Lieutenant Reynaldo Samson was marked for death days before the ambush in the village of Kapinpilan on Tuesday. Samson and his aide, Corporal Salipudin Endab, were killed while three others – Senior Master Sergeant Reynante Quinalayo, and corporals Rogelio Dela Cuesta and Marc Clint Dayaday – were wounded when armed men sprayed their patrol vehicle with automatic gunfire. Samson’s team was headed back to their police station after they failed to locate Kamir Kambal, a man ordered arrested by a court concerning a robbery case when they were attacked in Sitio Pasio, Barangay Kapinpilan. Maguindanao police spokesperson Major Reggie Abillera said Samson and Endab were killed on the spot. “The volume of fire was directed at the vehicle’s front where they were seated,” he said. A police intelligence operative claimed his group submitted an intelligence report to their superiors as early as August 23 alerting them that the BIFF group led by Guianid planned to assassinate Samson. The intelligence report said the group was “out to liquidate Police Lieutenant Reynaldo Samson at any opportune time.” The exact reason for the alleged plot was unclear, but a copy of the intelligence report showed it had something to do with Samson’s “strict implementation of traffic rules and regulations” in Ampatuan town. The document could not be immediately validated, but hours after the ambush, Camp Crame replaced Maguindanao police director Colonel Christopher Panapan with Colonel Roel Rullan Sermese from the Soccsksargen regional police. Department of the Interior and Local Government Secretary Benjamin Abalos Jr. and PNP chief General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. went to Maguindanao on Wednesday, August 31, to confer Samson and Endab with posthumous awards. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines — Malacañang on Monday, April 7, said there was still “no concrete evidence” to the claim of its own National Security Council (NSC) that China’s detention of three Filipinos for alleged espionage was in “retaliation” against the arrest of Chinese nationals accused of spying in the Philippines. “There is no concrete evidence yet if it is really retaliation or a part of retaliation of the other country. We will not say that because there is no final investigation on that matter. But there is still ongoing investigation on that and we will just defer all the details to DFA (Department of Foreign Affairs) and to (Department of National Defense),” said Undersecretary Claire Castro in a briefing. On April 5, the NSC spokesperson Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya had said in a statement that the arrest of the three, Palawan locals who had previously been part of a learning exchange with the Chinese province of Hainan, “can be seen as a retaliation for the series of legitimate arrests of Chinese agents and accomplices by Philippine law enforcement and counter-intelligence agencies in recent months.” Beginning January 2025, Philippine law enforcement has publicized the arrest of both Chinese and even Filipino nationals over what investigators claim were acts of espionage against critical Philippine infrastructure, including military bases and waterways. Castro, press briefer for the Palace, said “legal assistance will always be given, all the necessary help and assistance will be provided.” The DFA had earlier said that it had been “formally made aware of the allegations against the three Filipinos who are currently detained in China.” “The Department has conveyed to the Chinese Government to ensure that these allegations are tried with due process and with full respect to the rights of the said Filipinos in accordance with domestic law and the Philippines-China Consular Agreement,” said DFA spokesperson Teresita Daza on April 4. Daza had confirmed in mid-March 2025 that three Palawan locals were under detention in China over allegations of espionage. In early April, China state media reported on the identity and status of the three detained Filipinos. The NSC, in its April 5 statement, said it was “alarmed” by the charges against the three, all former recipients of a Hainan Government Scholarship program created through a sister province arrangement with Palawan. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine government secured a post-disaster loan of 30 billion yen (P11,818,122,000) and a grant aid 1.1 billion yen (P433,331,140) to procure a Satellite Data Communication System for the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG). Foreign Affairs Secretary Enrique Manalo and Japanese Ambassador Koshikawa Kazuhiko signed the exchange of notes on Tuesday, August 8, formalizing the loan and grant project under Japan’s Official Development Assistance. This is the third time that the Japanese government is giving the Philippines a post-disaster loan. The first loan was given in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda in 2013; while the second one was given in 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic response. Kazuhiko said they expect that the low interest funds of 0.01% per annum would give the Philippines elbow room to “execute more swift and flexible initial responses to severe disasters in the coming years.” “With Typhoon Egay having attacked the Philippines just last month, it is evident that our countries are frequently exposed to natural disasters such as typhoons, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions,” said Kazuhiko on Tuesday. As an archipelagic country themselves, Kazuhiko said Japan understands how important maritime security is for the Philippines. Providing better maritime technology to the PCG is part of Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy that aims to foster stable relationships, freedom of navigation, free trade among ASEAN countries, India, Australia, and the US. The satellite project should improve PCG’s law enforcement capabilities, which can help secure the Sulu-Celebes Sea which has a history of piracy and terrorism. Sulu and Celebes Seas are bodies of water found southwest of the Philippines, with the Sulu archipelago coming in the middle. The Philippines is currently embroiled in territorial disputes, particularly with superpower China – an ongoing conflict which requires a more modernized Navy and array of equipment. “In light of the situations in the South China Sea, this is a very timely cooperation that will enable the decision makers of the Philippine government here in Manila to grasp in real time the situation off shore,” said Kazuhiko. Early this week, China has blocked and fired a water cannon on small Philippine vessels in the West Philippine Sea. – Rappler.com 1 Japanese yen = 0.39 Philippine peso",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines on Thursday, January 16, expressed its “serious concern” over the incursions of China Coast Guard (CCG) vessels, including the so-called “monster ship,” in the Philippines’ maritime zones during a Bilateral Consultation Mechanism on the South China Sea (BCM) in Xiamen, China. “The Philippines expressed serious concern regarding recent incidents in the South China Sea, particularly the activities of CCG 5901 and CCG 3103 in Philippine maritime zones that are inconsistent with the 1982 UNCLOS and the Philippine Maritime Zones Act,” the Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) said in a release to the media. Since early January, China has been sending vessels, including the massive CCG 5901, to an area just 60 to 90 nautical miles away from the coast of Zambales. The Philippine Coast Guard has been challenging the CCG ship, as it remains sailing in those waters. The National Security Council’s Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya has called on China to withdraw their ships. The DFA said the two countries also “exchanged views” on a “provisional understanding” aimed to avoid tensions and confrontations during resupply missions to Ayungin Shoal, where the BRP Sierra Madre serves as a military outpost for the Philippines. The two countries “acknowledged its positive outcomes, and agreed to continue its implementation to sustain the de-escalation of tensions without prejudice to respective national positions,” said the DFA. Without going into details, China and the Philippines “agreed to reinvigorate the platform for coast guard cooperation” — a proposal that was first brought up in July 2024, in the aftermath of a tense June 17, 2024 confrontation between the CCG and elite Philippine soldiers in Ayungin or Second Thomas Shoal. “The two sides also identified ocean meteorology as an area of focus for a workshop on marine scientific cooperation,” said the DFA. DFA Undersecretary Ma. Theresa Lazaro, who led the Philippine contingent, said the Philippines was willing to “engage in dialogue” even as its “position is clear and consistent.” “We firmly believe that despite the unresolved challenges and differences, there is genuine space for diplomatic and pragmatic cooperation in dealing with our issues in the South China Sea,” she said in her opening remarks. This is the 10th iteration of the BCM, which started in 2017 under former president Rodrigo Duterte. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Former Supreme Court justice Antonio Carpio has raised concerns that licensed Philippine offshore gaming operators (POGOs) catering to the mainland Chinese market are merely being used as fronts for illegal activities. According to Carpio, the Philippine Amusement and Gaming Corporation’s (PAGCOR) should not have issued any licenses to POGOs operated by China, given that gambling is banned in China. Access to websites of POGOs claiming to cater to the mainland Chinese market would have also been blocked by China’s “Great Firewall,” the country’s powerful censorship machinery. “Have you heard about the ‘great firewall of China?’ The online POGOs claiming to operate in China are blocked. They get license from PAGCOR saying they operate in China but they are blocked,” Carpio said during the Kapihan sa Manila Bay media forum on Saturday, July 20. The former SC justice alleged that Chinese-run POGOs are using the license as “cover only so they can have buildings, operation with computers.” He said that the firms might instead be engaged in scamming and internet phishing. Carpio said he hoped President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. would speak up against POGOs in his upcoming 3rd State of the Nation Address. “It is probably good if he can announce he is against the rules of PAGCOR issuing licenses on POGO that cater to the mainland Chinese market,” Carpio said on Saturday. “Just cancel those licenses. We are just fooling ourselves,” he added. Carpio, along with former senator Leila de Lima and former SC justice Conchita Carpio Morales, had previously urged President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to cancel the licenses granted to POGOs. “PAGCOR cannot, and should not, issue a license to any POGO that caters to the mainland Chinese market. Any such license is void ab initio under PAGCOR’s own regulations,” their open letter read. POGOs first began expanding in the Philippines in 2016 under the administration of Rodrigo Duterte, which took a liberal stance in regulating the industry. Although China has repeatedly asked for POGOs in the country to be shut down, the Philippine government has never issued a ban against POGOs, in part due to the economic gains that the POGOs supposedly bring in. However, the tide has begun to turn under the Marcos administration. Officials on Marcos’ economic team have pointed out that the “social costs” of POGOs outweigh their economic benefits. The Alice Guo saga in the Senate and continued raids on illegal POGOs have also fueled further calls from politicians for a complete ban. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Thursday, January 30, that plans to meet with US President Donald Trump over his new immigration policy seen to affect the hundreds of thousands of US-based Filipinos. While replying to a question on Trump’s order to freeze foreign aid, Marcos said in a chance media interview in Cebu: “The US has frozen aid but I will meet with President Trump because…there is much that we need to discuss between the US and Philippines in terms of trade, in terms of defense and security, and now the new policy on immigration. Nagpauwi na yata ng ilang daan na Filipino (I think hundreds of Filipinos have been sent home).” “This is something that we have to work through and hopefully resolve because Filipinos in the US especially have formed a very important part of their workforce,” he added. Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez earlier reported that 24 Filipinos had been recently deported and 80 more were up for deportation. However, these were cases that were tried from the Biden administration. “We’ll see how we can influence the policymaking in terms of immigration,” Marcos said. Marcos added that he also plans to bring up the new administration’s plans to freeze aid, and what it means for the Philippines, as well as trade and defense and security matters. No date was mentioned for the planned meeting. The Philippines and the United States are treaty allies. After Trump was inaugurated on January 20, the White House boasted the first of its deportation flights on social media. Trump’s mass deportation plan, which was a highlight of his campaign, sent fears through the Filipino-American community — as even some documented immigrants felt uncertain about the future. There are more than 4 million individuals living in the US who are Filipino nationals or of Filipino descent. Romualdez earlier estimated some 350,000 Filipinos staying in the country illegally. He had advised undocumented Filipinos to voluntarily return to the Philippines instead of risk deportation. Migrante USA, a human rights organization of Filipino migrants in the USA, said on Thursday that it had received reports of arrests by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and detention of at least eight Filipino workers in the Chicago suburbs, including caregivers. “We demand the Philippine government to live up to its mandate and respond. This advice of Romualdez and [Foreign Undersecretary Eduardo] de Vega to undocumented Filipinos to just accept the situation and keep quiet is irresponsible and dangerous,” Migrante USA said. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines –The Philippine Health Insurance Corporation (PhilHealth) said its single confinement policy (SPC) has already been scrapped. PhilHealth Executive Vice President Eli Santos told senators on Wednesday, October 2, that the policy shift took effect on October 1 even though the circular has yet to be published publicly. “This will take effect October 1, 2024, Mr. Chairperson, and the policy will be published on October 7, 2024. This will have a retroactive effect effective October 1, 2024,” Santos told the Senate joint committees on health and demography and finance. The “single period of confinement (SPC) rule” provided that beneficiaries who are confined due to an illness can only be covered by PhilHealth once within a 90-day period. This leaves patients to fend for themselves in case they get readmitted for the same illness. PhilHealth corporate affairs vice president Rey Baleña said those who will pay for the cost of a readmission from October 1 to 6 are entitled to reimbursements. This applies to public and private health facilities. “Readmissions starting October 1 this year will be covered by this lifting of the SPC rule,” Baleña told Rappler in a text message. “At any rate, we will not deny claims affected. Paglabas ng circular (When the circular is released) and the system for this, all affected claims will be paid accordingly.” He added that the state health insurer already called for an emergency meeting with the country’s hospital groups to inform them of the policy change ahead of time. PhilHealth’s benefits committee (BenCom) had recommended on September 24 to scrap the policy. The recommendation was then adopted by the state insurer’s board of directors on September 27. “We complied with our promise to lift the rule on single period of confinement,” Santos said. Data from the DOH show that the controversial policy led to the denial of 26,750 claims in 2023. Most of the cases for readmission included community acquired pneumonia, acute gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and chronic kidney disease, among other illnesses. To be again covered by PhilHealth, some patients were advised to change their diagnosis or reason for hospital admission. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – First Lady Liza Araneta-Marcos said that President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. will likely “grant the wish” of LGBT Pilipinas, a group that backed his 2022 run, to create an “advisory body or commission” for LGBTQIA+ affairs. Araneta-Marcos hosted the group at the Palace Heroes’ Hall to celebrate Pride on Thursday eveningm June 29, and witnessed the oath-taking of the new set of officers of LGBT Pilipinas, according to Malacañang. A Malacañang press statement said that LGBT Pilipinas wants “more visibility and representation in the bureaucracy” through the proposed advisory body or commission, which would be under the Office of the President. In the Philippines, explicit protections for those who identify as LGBTQIA+ is mostly piecemeal and local, through ordinances. An anti-SOGIE discrimination bill, in different forms, has been pending before Congress for over two decades. LGBT Pilipinas is lobbying for the creation of the advisory body through the First Lady, said Malacañang. “Knowing my husband, I’m sure he will grant the wish because he knows that you all campaigned for him and he wouldn’t be there without you guys. So, thank you very much. I think it’s our way of giving back to those who helped him in the election,” the Palace statement quoted her as saying. LGBT Pilipinas mobilized and campaigned for both Marcos and Duterte during the 2022 polls. It was during an LGBT Pilipinas even where Duterte opened up about her own discovery of gender expression, telling members back in March 2022 that she “sometimes wants to be a man and sometimes wants to be a woman.” While the group, which claims a 120,000-strong membership around the country, endorsed Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte, progressive LGBTQ+ organizations did not. The group also supported former president Rodrigo Duterte, who had falsely claimed that being gay was a disease, and even as he used queerness as a punchline in his rambling speeches. Neither Marcos nor Sara made clear their stands on queer rights during the campaign. Sara once expressed support for a SOGIE equality bill but said transgender women should undergo “sexual reassignment” before using women’s restrooms. A SOGIE anti-discrimination bill, or legislation that would bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and gender expression, is not a Marcos priority bill. Yet Marcos said during the Pride event at Malacañang that his administration wanted equality for all and protecting against discrimination based on one’s “orientation.” “We in the Philippines ay ang habol lang naman talaga natin (what we really want) is that everybody is treated not for any other thing, not for race, not for creed, not for orientation, but just as Filipinos. And that this government, that’s what it’s trying to do,” he said, while conceding that his wife was “better briefed” on legal issues that impact the queer community. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – As China continues its incursions in the West Philippine Sea, the Philippines said that it was crafting guidelines on the conduct of maritime activities in the waterway, including joint patrols with the country’s allies. The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) confirmed the development on Thursday, March 2, after senior officials from the United States, Japan, and Australia had held meetings with Philippine officials in recent weeks. “GPH (Government of the Philippines) is in the process of crafting guidelines for the conduct of combined maritime activities in the WPS, including joint patrols,” the DFA said in a statement. It added that the Philippines and US would discuss “operational details, including on the possibility of engaging other regional partners” as part of the two country’s security cooperation. No other details were offered as of posting. The DFA’s statements comes after officials from the US, Japan, and Australia separately tackled the possibility of conducting joint patrols with the Philippines as part of efforts to address China’s growing aggression in the South China Sea. The Philippines had previously suspended joint patrols with the US in October 2016 under orders from former president Rodrigo Duterte. In February 2023, Manila and Washington confirmed that the two countries had agreed to restart joint patrols, after US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin III made his first trip to the Philippines under the Marcos administration. Since then, officials from both countries have said that advanced talks were underway on the issue. Japan, meanwhile, earlier said that it was exploring the possibility of cooperating with partners to reinforce maritime domain awareness and maritime law enforcement activities in the region. Meanwhile, in a visit to the Philippines last February 22, Australian Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Richard Marles likewise confirmed that it was in talks for the conduct joint patrols in the South China Sea. “We will continue that work and we hope that that comes to fruition soon,” Marles said. In an effort to shore up it presence and defense in the West Philippines Sea, the Marcos administration has sought to expand security ties with the Philippine regional partners, while focusing international attention on the dispute. In 2016, the Philippines won a landmark legal award asserting its rights in the West Philippine Sea. China though has continued to ignore the ruling, which it considered “invalid.” The 2016 Hague ruling struck down China’s expansive claims, actions, and nine-dash-line in the South China Sea as illegal. – Rappler.com",

Press Secretary Trixie Cruz-Angeles confirmed Bersamin’s appointment on Tuesday, September 27, saying Bersamin had taken his oath before Marcos earlier in the day prior to attending the ninth Cabinet meeting. Bersamin, who retired from the SC in October 2019, turns 73 next month. Today we administered the oath of Former Chief Justice Lucas Purugganan Bersamin as the acting Executive Secretary of our administration. https://t.co/wxnRfxhuru Rodriguez served as executive secretary for less than three months, making him the shortest serving executive secretary in recent years. Rodriguez is now Marcos’ chief of staff. Before Malacañang confirmed Rodriguez’ resignation, word was going around that the President was looking for a new executive secretary, and that a former Supreme Court justice was among those being eyed. Bersamin’s 10-year stint in the High Court had been marked by controversial ponencias and concurring votes, including the acquittal of former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and the bail grant to plunder defendant Juan Ponce Enrile, now Marcos’ chief legal adviser. Bersamin’s bail grant favoring Enrile, in particular, had been based on humanitarian considerations because of old age and was later cited by the anti-graft court Sandiganbayan in keeping Imelda Marcos free despite conviction for seven counts of graft. He was also one of the nine Supreme Court justices who voted to allow a hero’s burial for the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos in 2016. Before leaving the SC, Bersamin said he wanted to be remembered as a “healing chief justice,” a reference to the controversial quo warranto case against former chief justice Maria Lourdes Sereno that had rocked the judiciary. (READ: Chief Justice Bersamin’s philosophy: Restraint in favor of government) Appointed to the Court by Arroyo in 2009, Bersamin came from the Court of Appeals, and before that, was a judge at the Quezon City Regional Trial Court (RTC).

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. relieved 610,054 agrarian reform beneficiaries long burdened by amortization fees when he signed the New Agrarian Emancipation Act on Friday, July 7. The new law, or Republic Act No. 11953, covers more than 1.7 million hectares of agrarian reform lands awarded under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program (CARP), and condones P57.65 billion of agrarian arrears. It is a fulfillment of a State of the Nation Address promise Marcos made in 2022. “I am here today to build on that promise because our beneficiaries deserve nothing less,” Marcos said during the ceremonial signing of the law. Peasants and government officials across the country watched the event from their provinces. But this is just one promise fulfilled. Filipino farmers are beset by a myriad of problems that have spanned decades of struggle. Raul Montemayor, national manager of the Federation of Free Farmers Cooperatives, took the law as a good sign that the government is genuine in helping farmers. However, there are more lands that need to be distributed. “Napakalaki pa ‘yung lupa na dapat sakop ng agrarian reform na hindi pa nauumpisahan,” said Montemayor in a radio interview on Friday. (There are still vast tracts of lands that are yet to be distributed under agrarian reform.) Since the implementation of the CARP three decades ago, the government has distributed by 2020 more than 4.9 million hectares, or 91% of the total land promised. Aside from incomplete land distribution, enhancing land productivity remains a roadblock in making agrarian reform felt by peasants. The Unyon ng mga Manggagawa sa Agrikultura said that as much as they welcome this new development, amortization is only one of the problems that the sector faces. “A heavier burden on farmers was the lack of support for making land granted to them productive, such as production subsidies, mechanized farm tools, irrigation services, and more,” the group said in a statement. Even the President acknowledges the problem of productivity and promises to provide more support to farmers. Now that loans are condoned, Montemayor said it would be easier for developers to buy and eventually convert the land for non-agricultural uses. “Actually ‘yun ang isang babantayan natin dahil mako-condone ‘yung utang, mapapadali ‘yung pagpapatitulo,” said Montemayor. (That’s one of the things that we need to look out for. If debt is condoned, giving away titles would be expedited.) Once condoned, the farmers would be free from encumbrance which hinders them in the first place from selling their land. “Baka mas malaki ngayon ‘yung pagkakataon sa mga developer na bilhin ngayon iyang mga lupang ‘yan at i-convert sa ibang non-agricultural use,” he added. (There will be a bigger chance for developers to buy the land and utilize it for non-agricultural use.) Developing agricultural lands for commercial use is one of the ways landlords had evaded land redistribution in the past. The principal loans valued at P14.5 billion of the 263,622 beneficiaries were already condoned outright. The remaining P43.06 billion in loans of 346,432 beneficiaries will be condoned when the Landbank and the Department of Agrarian Reform submit details to Congress. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "CAGAYAN DE ORO, Philippines – The grocery shelves that used to display soft drinks are empty, and small neighborhood stores in Cagayan de Oro are selling these popular non-alcoholic beverages at prices twice as much as they did in July. The shortage in the supply of the fast-selling soft drinks is hurting sari-sari stores in the city and other areas, Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) officials said on Monday, October 3. DTI-Misamis Oriental director Almer Masillones said the shortage adversely affected small store owners more than groceries and fast food outlets. “Sari-sari store owners are already complaining about the shortage, and wondering where they can get their supplies,” Masillones said. He said the situation has worried government regulators because soft drinks, while not basic commodities, are considered essential to the business of small neighborhood store owners. The soft drink scarcity came even as the Philippines projected a sugar production of 2.03 million metric tons in 2022, which is short by 200,000 MT. Major beverage companies Coca-Cola, Pepsi-Cola, and ARC Refreshments Corporation have confirmed a shortage in premium-refined sugar, an important ingredient in their beverage products. In August, Coca-Cola Philippines was forced to suspend operations in some of its key manufacturing plants in the country because of the shortage of sugar. Lawyer Ruth Sybil Salvador, the local DTI mediation officer, said the situation resulted in the hoarding of soft drinks, especially the popular beverage products of Coca-Cola. Salvador said the local DTI office has already received complaints from store owners about the soft drink hoarding in some warehouses. Officials were also informed that the shortage pushed the retail prices of soft drinks by as much as 100% in Cagayan de Oro. In one subdivision in uptown Cagayan de Oro, a 1.5-liter Coke is now being sold for more than P100. “A small bottle of soft drink is more expensive than the price of a liter of gasoline or diesel,” complained Menzie Montes, a reporter from Radio Mindanao Network’s I-FM in Cagayan de Oro. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "COTABATO CITY, Philippines – Of the over 900 generals and colonels in the Philippine National Police, only 10 did not heed the call of Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos to submit their courtesy resignation to jumpstart the cleansing process in the PNP. Abalos said in Cotabato City on Monday, January 23, that 10 of the PNP’s highest-ranking officials have not tendered their courtesy resignations. “Some are retiring,” said Abalos, who visited the city for the 4th founding anniversary celebration of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). He did not elaborate but said that he was thankful that the majority of the PNP generals and colonels cooperated to make it easier for the Marcos administration to purge the police organization. In early January, Abalos called on police generals and colonels to submit their courtesy resignation as part of efforts to purge the PNP of erring cops, especially those with drug links. In the BARMM alone, two generals, including PNP regional director Brigadier General John Guyguyon, and 13 colonels tendered their courtesy resignation days after Abalos made the call. Last week, PNP chief General Rodolfo Azurin Jr. said more than 97% of the country’s 953 generals and colonels heeded Abalos’ call. He said two generals and five colonels who have not submitted their resignation letters would retire before the 2nd quarter. The PNP said all those who volunteered to resign would be assessed by a five-person committee led by Baguio Mayor Benjamin Magalong, a retired police general. The committee’s recommendations would then be reviewed by the National Police Commission (Napolcom), and submitted to President Marcos Jr. who may accept or reject the resignations. In Cotabato, Abalos called on Bangsamoro officials to help the Marcos administration crack down on illegal drugs and to ensure that prison facilities in the region are drug-free. “You must give them a drug-free environment. It’s about correction. It’s about rehabilitation. If drugs are sneaked into these facilities, then our campaign is useless,” he said. Abalos also ordered the BARMM police to carry out the anti-drug campaign and expand its coverage to 63 villages in Cotabato province that are now part of the Bangsamoro’s political territory. While Cotabato province is part of Soccsksargen, 63 of its villages voted to become BARMM’s special geographic areas, a setup that has resulted in confusion and overlapping of functions between the PNP-Soccksargen and PNP-BARMM. Abalos said it was already agreed that the 63 special geographic areas in Cotabato province would be the responsibility of PNP-BARMM. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) on Sunday, May 26, warned that China will be going against international law if it pushes through with its newest coast guard regulation. In a statement, DFA expressed “serious concern” about the new regulation that would enable the Chinese Coast Guard to apprehend people it deemed “trespassers” in its waters, especially in the context of rising tensions between China and the Philippines. The regulation was announced on May 15, 2024 and is expected to take effect on June 15, 2024. “China would be in direct violation of international law should it enforce these new regulations in the waters and maritime features within the illegal, null and void, and expansive 10-dash line, which would effectively cover areas of the West Philippine Sea where the Philippines has sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, or in the high seas,” DFA said. While any state has the right to have its own laws, the Philippine government agency reminded China that domestic laws cannot be applied in the “territory, maritime zones, or jurisdictions of other states, nor violate other sovereign states’ rights and entitlements under international law.” “We reiterate our call for China to comply with international law and desist from any action that would undermine peace and security in the region,” it said. China earlier said that the new regulations merely “standardize the administrative law-enforcement procedures of Coast Guard agencies and better uphold order at sea,” and that it is “consistent with universal practices.” Defense Secretary Gibo Teodoro on Friday, May 24, tagged this new move by China as “provocation, adding that its implementation is a “matter of international concern” since it is a “breach of international peace.” The National Security Council (NSC), meanwhile, urged Filipino fisherfolk – who have already been subjected to harassment and intimidation by both Chinese state agents and vessels – to not be afraid of the new regulation. NSC spokesperson Assistant Director General Jonathan Malaya earlier said Filipino fisherfolk can continue fishing in the West Philippine Sea as they are “backed by the law and your government.” – Rappler.com",

The Island Cove POGO hub in Kawit, Cavite, ended its operations on November 30, based on signs posted on its facade. This is a month before the December 31 deadline set by the government on the closure of all POGOs and internet gaming licensees (IGLs) in the country. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. first announced a ban on POGOs in his State of the Nation Address (SONA) in July. He issued Executive Order No. 74 in early November to guide the implementation of the ban. The government started canceling the work visas of foreign POGO workers on October 15. Kawit Mayor Angelo Aguinaldo said in an interview in October that as many as 7,000 Cavite residents will be affected by the Island Cove POGO closure. The Department of Labor and Employment earlier said that it does not expect all displaced POGO and IGL workers to get their desired jobs following the shutdown of their companies’ operations. The Senate probe into illegal POGOs in the country played a key role in the government’s decision to impose a POGO ban, especially after the committee chaired by Senator Risa Hontiveros exposed the questionable Filipino citizenship of dismissed Bamban, Tarlac mayor Alice Guo. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) this week raised its operations on the Oriental Mindoro oil spill to Tier 3, or the highest level, which means that the spills are “broader in scale and scope” and require more “resources from national and international sources” to control the spillage. This was contained in the March 24 situation report by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources, which was sent to the media on Saturday, March 25. The PCG follows the National Oil Spill Contingency Plan (NOSCOP), which details the tiered response to oil spill situations at various levels: As of Friday, March 24, 17 cities and municipalities have been affected by the oil spill. Environment Secretary Ma. Antonia Yulo-Loyzaga had warned that the oil spill in Oriental Mindoro threatens marine ecology not only of the Philippines but the world. According to the latest situation report, the following environmental effects were observed during a biodiversity rapid assessment from March 6 to 10: Meanwhile, in a press conference on Thursday, March 23, Oriental Mindoro Governor Humerlito “Bonz” Dolor and an insurance representative announced that victims of the oil spill could start the process of filing for compensation arising from economic losses. The Maritime Industry Authority (MARINA) moved to stop the operations of RDC Reield Marine Services, the company that owns MT Princess Empress – the sunken vessel responsible for the oil spill. The closure orders are in effect until authorities finish their investigation into the embattled company. RDC has been in hot water amid questions surrounding the authority of MT Princess Empress to operate. MARINA said the oil tanker, which sank off the coast of Oriental Mindoro with 800,000 liters of bunker fuel in early March, had no updated permit because the company has yet to amend its original certificate of public convenience (CPC). A CPC is a license issued by MARINA to domestic ship operators to engage in domestic shipping activities – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Department of Social Welfare and Development Secretary (DSWD) Secretary Erwin Tulfo was absent on Tuesday, December 20, from the 13th Cabinet meeting of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., the last for 2022. Tulfo, who was bypassed for a second time by the Commission on Appointments (CA) last December 14 , told Rappler in a text message he was “on leave” and that an undersecretary attended the meeting in his place. “I am on leave. I informed President Marcos. Undersecretary [Adonis] Sulit was there,” Tulfo said, without stating the reason for his leave. For Marcos’ 13th cabinet meeting, new Palace briefer Daphne Oseña-Paez, said department heads presented the key accomplishments of their respective agencies from July to December, and their programs for 2023. “In the Cabinet meeting earlier, only 11 were able to present their accomplishments because there was not enough time,” Oseña-Paez said in a mix of Filipino and English. “Those who were not able to present will do so during the next Cabinet meeting in January,” she added. The DSWD was not among those which presented during the Tuesday Cabinet meeting. The DSWD secretary was scheduled to appear at a services caravan event in Lapu-Lapu City, Cebu, on Wednesday December 21. Tulfo did not comment when asked by Rappler if he had already discussed his reappointment with Marcos.Ad-interim secretaries can only be reappointed two times if they are bypassed by the CA. Afterwards, Marcos would have to appoint a new secretary to fill the vacant position. CA members bypassed Tulfo because of his citizenship issues and a libel conviction that was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2008, Senator Juan Miguel Zubiri told reporters last December 12.Tulfo, a well-known former broadcaster, previously said he renounced his US citizenship prior to his appointment in 2022. Zubiri said that they would confer legal experts – and possibly the Supreme Court – on Tulfo’s libel conviction. “There are implications, the CA has never confirmed anyone with final conviction,” Zubiri said in Filipino then. “We have to study first the legal implications. It’s moral turpitude, there has been precedence in the SC. There are decided cases.” Zubiri, who heads the CA, said they would take up Tulfo’s appointment in the first CA hearing in early 2023. At the November 22 CA hearing, Tulfo asked for an executive session to discuss his citizenship and libel conviction issues with the lawmakers. – Rappler.com",

The EC had warned in 2021 it would withdraw its recognition of Filipino seafarers’ certificates unless serious measures were taken, including compliance with the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for seafarers. The Philippines, among the world’s biggest suppliers of maritime labor, has since made serious efforts to comply with the requirements, particularly in key areas like the monitoring, supervision, and evaluation of training and assessment, the EC announced on Friday, March 31. Marcos had met with EC President Ursula von der Leyen in December, when he attended the ASEAN-EU summit in Brussels, to discuss the 15-year-old issue involving Filipino seafarers. In a statement, he said his administration will do everything to address all other issues faced by the local maritime industry so that the Philippines can produce more world-class seafarers. The EC said it intends to provide the Philippines with technical assistance to further improve its education, training and certification system for seafarers. The seafarers are among millions of overseas Filipinos sending home more than $2.5 billion of their earnings each month, boosting consumer spending that drives growth of the domestic economy. – Rappler.com",

      "article_type": "NewsArticle",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Fisherfolk, led by the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Management Council (FARMC) in Rizal, filed a complaint before the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) on Wednesday, January 10, asking for the suspension of reclamation activities in Laguna Lake. Joining the fisherfolk during the protest outside LLDA’s national office were groups Philippine Movement for Climate Justice, Sanlakas Rizal, and the Alliance of Unified People’s Organization in Lupang Arenda (APOLA). Fisherfolk are on the losing end if reclamation activities for the development projects in Laguna Lake continue, said Sonny San Jose, chairperson of Rizal FARMC, in a statement. “Sa pagliit ng espasyo na puwede naming pangisdaan, lumiliit din ang aming kabuhayan,” San Jose said. (As the space where we can fish diminishes, our livelihood is curtailed.) Signing the complaint alongside San Jose were members of FARMC in Tanay, Taytay, Angono, Binangonan, Morong, Baras, Jala-Jala, and Pililia. Vicente Barlos, president of APOLA, and Jose Tagle, president of Federation Binangonan, were also signatories. In the complaint, they urged the LLDA to order a suspension of activities pending investigation, and to start the rehabilitation of affected areas. The LLDA can receive complaints as a quasi-judicial agency. The body could issue a decision and/or take official action after its investigation. Decisions released by quasi-judicial agencies are usually brought to courts. Barlos told Rappler in a phone interview that a staff from the LLDA met with them when they filed the complaint and said the office promised to hold a dialogue with them after a week. Barlos said the LLDA clarified that what’s happening in the area was not reclamation but land recovery. “Sa totoo, kaliwa’t kanan ang ginagawa nilang reclamation,” said Barlos. (In truth, they’re doing reclamation left and right.) Among the projects slated in the area are large-scale ones, including the government’s Laguna Lakeshore Road Network and San Miguel Corporation’s Southeast Metro Manila Expressway. Laguna Lake is the largest inland lake in the country, connected to Manila Bay through the Pasig River. It is surrounded by Metro Manila and the provinces of Rizal and Laguna. The complainants said they conducted a fluvial inspection of Laguna Lake in November 2023 and observed reclamation activities in Taytay, Angono, and Binangonan. According to them, no consultations were conducted with residents and other affected sectors about the nature and purpose of the projects. They have since tried to seek clarifications from concerned agencies such as the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and the Philippine Reclamation Authority, to no avail. Thus, they said, they were invoking the authority of the LLDA to investigate the matter. “[This] complaint is the next step in our search for answers and solutions,” the document read. Under the law, the LLDA is tasked to protect the lake and regulate development and livelihood activities. The body can “pass upon and approve or disapprove” proposed projects from the government and private sector. – Rappler.com",

The DTI in Bicol ordered strict enforcement of the price freeze as the threat of a major eruption by Mayon Volcano sent more than 4,000 families or 15,658 persons to evacuation camps in five towns and three cities. A price freeze accompanies the declaration of a state of calamity, which Albay’s provincial board approved on June 9, a day after after Mayon Volcano’s status was raised to Alert Level 3. The DTI also issued a guide on what goods are considered basic commodities. Two days after the Sangguaniang Panlalawigan of Albay approved Resolution No. 0607-2023OIC, DTI regional director Dindo Galvo Nabol said Albay’s supply of basic commodities are sufficient for the next 30 days. Nabol also issued the memorandum circular on the price freeze on June 9, addressing all wet markets, supermarkets, groceries, bakeries, and water refilling stations. “When a state of calamity is declared in a particular area, prices of basic necessities (BN) are automatically frozen at their prevailing prices for sixty (60) days or until sooner lifted,” Nabol reminded business owners. Violators of the price freeze could face fines from P5,000 to PhP1 million and or imprisonment of one year to ten years. Farmers in Tabaco City, Albay scrambled over the weekend to harvest their crops within the six-kilometer radius permanent danger zone (PDZ) of the volcano. Tabaco City Mayor Krisel Lagman-Luistro gave farmers the harvest green to allow them to gather food stock or generate income before a potentially deadly eruption.",

Based on the orders issued by the Department of Health (DOH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2021, processed food products containing trans fatty acids are prohibited from being manufactured, imported, and distributed for commercial sale after June 18. The FDA said that all product formulations and labels of prepackaged processed food containing trans fat must be fully compliant with their guidelines. This policy was implemented to address the high consumption of trans fat, which increases the risk of developing coronary heart disease and other diseases. Foods like margarine, coffee creamer, and baked goods such as donuts and cookies are typically rich in industrial trans fat, according to the World Health Organization. “Trans fats are the source of our problem for noncommunicable diseases: hypertension, obesity, stroke. Many countries have already banned it, so it’s our turn,” DOH Secretary Ted Herbosa said. According to the DOH, about 3,000 Filipinos suffer yearly from premature mortality related to the high consumption of trans fat. On Monday, health advocates from different sectors launched Bantay Kontra Trans Fat as an initiative to make sure that food manufacturers will comply with the DOH and FDA’s programs to eliminate trans fat. “We have to remain vigilant, empower consumers, and foster compliance,” said Sophia San Luis of public interest group ImagineLaw. She said they will conduct a nationwide literacy campaign in reading packages and labels of food products and educate consumers on the dangers of other sources of trans fats. To report possible noncompliance of food manufacturers to the DOH and FDA orders, San Luis said the public may message the Trans Fat Free Philippines’ Facebook page. Violation of any of the provisions of the administrative order and the FDA circular would be grounds for the disapproval, suspension, or cancelation of the certificate of product registration of concerned food manufacturers. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "GENERAL SANTOS, Philippines – The shadow of filariasis has fallen once again on South Cotabato following the confirmation of a case in Koronadal. Six years ago, the province was declared free of the disease, but now, public health workers are fighting to prevent an outbreak from taking hold in the Soccsksargen region, as the specter of this debilitating and disfiguring disease looms once again. The province had been declared filariasis-free by the Department of Health (DOH) in November 2017, after a near-zero prevalence of the disease was recorded over a five-year period. Jose Baroquillo, coordinator for mosquito-borne diseases of South Cotabato’s Integrated Provincial Health Office, confirmed that one out of 38 people tested in Sitio El Nalam, Barangay Assumption, Koronadal City, was found positive for filariasis on January 21. The infected person has been isolated and the infection is still at an early stage, which means it is still curable. To prevent the spread of the disease, health workers have launched a mass blood-testing program and will spray-fog houses in the affected area. Councilor Ester Catorce, who initiated the health outreach program, said the team will also inform residents about the disease and how to prevent its spread. In 2021, 33 cases of filariasis were detected in the villages of Maan and Mongocayo in T’boli town, but were immediately treated. Baroquillo, however, said the detected cases since 2021 did not affect the province’s filariasis-free status, and its prevalence rate has remained below 1% of the population. He also said those who tested positive for the disease, including the recent case, did not show symptoms. Filariasis, also known as elephantiasis, is caused by parasitic worms Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi or B. timori, which are transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes. Elimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through large-scale treatment (called mass drug administration) delivered as an annual dose of medicines to all at-risk individuals in an endemic area https://t.co/i7LDEFOsg9 The worms develop into adult worms in the lymphatic vessels, causing severe damage and swelling. The disease can lead to permanent disability or disfigurement, and is treated with preventive chemotherapy. While one case of filariasis may not necessarily indicate a widespread outbreak, health workers normally investigate and determine if there are other cases, or if the individual may have acquired the infection in a community or area where transmission is ongoing. Such measures help determine if public health interventions such as vector control, treatment, and education are needed to prevent further transmission. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The camp of Laban ng Masa chairperson Walden Bello has urged Justice Secretary Crispin Remulla to “exercise independence” in relation to the former vice presidential candidate’s cyber libel case. Luke Espiritu, one of Bello’s legal counsels, made the call during a press conference on Wednesday, August 10. “I really encourage Secretary Remulla to exercise the independence that is incumbent upon his office. Because siya ang (he is) secretary ng mismong (of the actual) justice department, which is obligated to defend justice without fear or favor at least [at] the prosecutorial level,” Espiritu said. On Monday, August 8, Bello was arrested over a cyber libel complaint filed by former Davao City information officer Jefry Tupas. He was released the following day after posting bail. He was indicted in July, prompting his camp to immediately file for a motion for reconsideration before the Davao prosecutor’s office, but it was denied. The Bello camp then sought the DOJ’s intervention by filing a petition before the justice department to review his libel and cyber libel cases on July 29, or prior to Bello’s arrest. During the newsbriefing, Espiritu also reminded the justice department of the power it holds in protecting “freedom.” “We must understand na itong laban na ito (that this fight) involves nothing less than our democracy, our right to free speech, and our freedom of expression,” Espiritu said. “And it should be the institution of our government that has the responsibility to protect this cherished freedom enshrined in our constitution. Therefore, Secretary Remulla, ang bola po ay nasa inyo, dalawa po ang choices ninyo: Hahayaan na lang ba natin na ang ating demokrasya, ang ating kalayaan sa pamamahayag ay babalahurain?” he added. (The ball is in your hands, you have two choices: Should we allow our democracy, our freedom of expression to be trampled upon?) Here is a summary of the points raised by the Bello camp in their petition filed before the justice department on July 29: While waiting for the DOJ’s decision on the appeal, Bello’s camp will also seek another legal action – a motion to suspend proceedings before the Regional Trial Court (RTC) 10 in Davao. The Bello camp said they will file the motion once the documents on Bello’s warrant and bail have returned to the court. The court has yet to announce the schedule of arraignment and pre-trial of the case. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "CAVITE, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday, October 31, thumbed down a proposal to declare a nationwide, year-long state of calamity in the aftermath of Severe Tropical Storm Paeng (Nalgae). “I don’t think it’s necessary. I came to that conclusion…in consultation with DENR (Department of Environment and Natural Resources). They said damage is highly localized,” said Marcos during a short Q&A on the sidelines of a visit to the storm-hit town of Noveleta in Cavite, south of Metro Manila. Marcos visited Cavite, among the provinces most affected by Paeng. Aside from Calabarzon or the upper half of the Southern Tagalog region, Western Visayas and the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) sustained the most damage and casualties. “I think we will focus better if we stay with the calamities status as we have now,” the President added, referring to existing proclamations. Placing an area under a state of calamity allows government – local government units, in the case of provinces, towns, and cities – access to funds reserved for disaster relief. The declaration would also freeze the prices of basic commodities. Noveleta is the first and so far only town Marcos has visited in the aftermath of Paeng’s onslaught. His visit to Noveleta was preceded by an aerial inspection over Cavite, where Governor Jonvic Remulla said 18,000 families were evacuated. The NDRRMC had earlier recommended that a national state of calamity be declared since most of the country’s regions experienced “the effects, damage and projected impacts” of Paeng. The Speaker of the House, Martin Romualdez had said he was amenable to the NDRRMC proposal, pending an assessment to be reported by congressmen and congresswomen from affected district, but one of the House leaders from Iloilo warned against a nationwide state of calamity declaration. As of posting, close to 100 people have died because of Severe Tropical Storm Paeng. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) has allowed adults aged 50 and above, and those with comorbidities, aged 18 to 49, to get their second COVID-19 booster shot. In a statement on Tuesday, July 26, the DOH said that the move is based on the recommendations of the Health Technology Assessment Council to the agency. It added that only Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be used for them, and will be given fourth months after their first booster or third dose of the vaccine. “As vaccine immunity wanes over time, we are dedicated to helping our people remain protected against COVID-19. We are making it easier for as many of our people to avail of the primary series and boosters – including second boosters,” DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said. The DOH said that eligible individuals can check the schedule of vaccine deployment with their local government units and private service providers. “As part of the preparation for the administration of second booster doses to the above-mentioned populations, orientations for local government units and vaccination centers are already scheduled,” the DOH said. Prior to this development, the second booster shot was only limited to healthcare workers, senior citizens, and immunocompromised individuals with specific medical conditions. The DOH said that eligible individuals need to bring their vaccination card and a valid ID. “A medical certificate is not required, even for those with comorbidities. The medical screener or doctor at the vaccination site is authorized to assess and make the determination,” the agency added. The DOH decided to administer a second booster shot to the age groups as the country deals with a new surge in cases driven by Omicron offshoots. “The DOH, along with other government agencies and private sector partners, aims to increase vaccine coverage nationwide. We need every eligible Juan and Juana to turn this into a whole-of-society fight against the virus,” Vergeire said. The government is targeting to administer booster shots to 50% of the eligible fully vaccinated individuals during the first 100 days of the administration of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., or to 23 million people. As of July 21, some 71 million individuals have been fully vaccinated. Only 15 million have availed of the first booster, while some 1.1 million have availed of their second booster. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "BATANGAS, Philippines – Oil sludge from the capsized MT Princess Empress has reached the shores of Pola and Pinamalayan in Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Coast Guard (PCG) Southern Tagalog said on Thursday, March 2. Even worse though, the vessel’s industrial oil cargo has also started to leak into waters off Naujan town, Mindoro Oriental, the PCG said. The announcement raised fears among fisher groups and environmentalists of long-term damage to the lush maritime environment around Mindoro island. The Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) warned of threats to 21 protected areas. At risk is the Verde Island Passage, a center of marine biodiversity, that links Mindoro to Batangas. “Nakaabot na kaninang umaga ang oil spill sa dalampasigan ng dalawang karatig bayan ng Pola at Pinamalayan (This morning the oil spill has reached the shores of nearby towns Pola and Pinamalayan),” Coast Guard Commodore Innocencio Rosario Jr., Southern Tagalog commander, told Rappler. “We presume it is industrial fuel oil with its appearance of black sticky and strong odor.” UPDATE: The @coastguardph has observed OIL SPILL STRANDING along the shoreline of Barangay Buhay na Tubig in Pola, Oriental Mindoro, today, 02 March 2023. pic.twitter.com/wcW7PEZ2ZN “Our troops from our (PCG) district stations here in Mindoro have documented the oil spill,” Rosario added. He said the BRP Melchora Aquino, a PCG Vessel, deployed it’s Rigid Hull, MTUG Titan, to start the mechanical recovery of spilt oil in the vicinity waters off the submerged motor tanker for further assessment. UPDATE: Kinumpirma ng @coastguardph na may halo na ring INDUSTRIAL FUEL OIL ang oil spill sa katubigan ng Naujan, Oriental Mindoro, ngayong araw, ika-02 ng Marso 2023. KARAGDAGANG DETALYE: https://t.co/XnYWKl8wUt#DOTrPH 🇵🇭#CoastGuardPH #MaritimeSectorWorks pic.twitter.com/AHgT7kPKF1 The PCG in Southern Tagalog has sent an augmentation request of forces from central headquarters, especially the Coast Guard Auxillary (Reserve). “I already sent a request letter to the national headquarters for some forces from Coast Guard Auxillary to augment our personnel on anticipation for extensive effect of oil spill on water of Mindoro,” said Rosario. He added that local government units in Oriental Mindoro had been informed of measures being taken to clean the spillage and the possible effects on the environment and livelihood. PCG’s Marine Environment Protection Unit, the DENR’s Environment Protection Management Bureau, and Malayan Towage and Salvage Corporation are coordinating to address the problem and consequences of the sea mishap. The oil from the submerged vessel has spread across a 40-kilometer radius, an area encroaching on 21 protected areas, including a fish sanctuary. Jay Lim of Tanggol Kalikasan, an environmental law group, also told Rappler the oil spill threatens all marine ecology, including coral reefs that serves fish sanctuaries. “Kami ay nangangamba sa masamang kontribusyon ng oil spill sa karagatan na nakakaambag para masira ang mga marine ecology particular ang coral reef na nagsislbing pangitlugan ng mga isda.” Lim said. (We fear that the oil spill is contributing to the damage to the marine ecology, particularly to the coral reefs that serve as fish spawing ground.) – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Audit (COA), which has the mandate to audit the spending of government funds, said it is open to reviewing existing guidelines on the use of confidential and intelligence funds (CIF). “Actually po, maganda po ‘yung inyong mungkahi. Because of the increasing confidential and intelligence funds, we will try to convene po interagency with the same interagency committee na nag-promulgate po nitong rules na ito so para ma-update natin ’cause medyo matagal na rin…2015, that’s 80 years ago,” COA Chairperson Gamaliel Cordoba said during the body’s budget hearing in Congress on Thursday, August 24. (Actually, your suggestion is good. Because of the increasing confidential and intelligence funds, we will try to convene with the same interagency committee that promulgated these rules so we can update them already because it’s been a long time. 2015, that’s 80 years ago.) The idea to review the COA guidelines was brought up by Kabataan Representative Raoul Manuel when he asked if the COA was willing to revisit the rules governing CIF. By definition, confidential funds are meant to be used for “surveillance activities in civilian government agencies that are intended to support the mandate or operations of the said agency.” Unlike other funds used by the government, CIF are not subject to the same rigorous auditing processes as other government funds. Based on the proposed budget for 2024, the government is asking for P10.14 billion in CIF across government agencies – majority of which will go to the offices of President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Vice President Sara Duterte. The hike in the budget allotted for CIF started during former president Rodrigo Duterte’s term, apparently maintained by his successor. Cordoba, during the hearing, said they will call for a meeting with other agencies within the third quarter of the year. According to the COA, the grant and liquidation of CIF are covered by Joint Circular No. 2015-01, dated January 8, 2015. The circular includes the COA, the Department of Budget and Management, the Department of the Interior and Local Government, the Department of National Defense, and the Governance Commission for Government-Owned and Controlled Corporations. The said circular states that intelligence funds can only be used for counter-intelligence activities and special projects and operations. Meanwhile, confidential funds can be used to purchase information necessary in the implementation of a government program, among others. Since the funds are supposedly intended for programs to protect national security, the specific uses of CIF are not disclosed to the public. In reviewing the expenditure of CIF, state auditors rely on the certifications of government agencies, since receipts are not always available for the transactions. – with research from Marjorie delos Reyes/ Rappler.com Marjorie delos Reyes, a Rappler intern, is a Development Communication student at UP Los Baños.

      "article_type": "NewsArticle",
      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The El Niño phenomenon has started to weaken and neutral conditions may return in April-May-June 2024, the country’s weather bureau said in a briefing on Thursday, March 7. But there is an “increasing probability” of La Niña developing in June-July-August 2024, prompting the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical, and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) to raise La Niña Watch also on Thursday. El Niño, La Niña, and neutral are the three phases of El Niño-Southern Oscillation or ENSO, which the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) defines as “a recurring natural phenomenon characterized by fluctuating ocean temperatures in the equatorial Pacific, coupled with changes in the atmosphere.” The current El Niño episode began in the tropical Pacific in June 2023, gradually progressing from weak to strong. In the Philippines, El Niño has triggered drought in at least 24 areas, a dry spell in 16 areas, and dry conditions in 10 areas as of February 29. The Department of Agriculture estimated on February 25 that El Niño has caused at least P357.4 million worth of damage and losses to farms in the Ilocos Region, Mimaropa, Western Visayas, and Zamboanga Peninsula. According to the WMO, the 2023-2024 El Niño “has peaked as one of the five strongest on record,” though it is weaker than the 1997-1998 and 2015-2016 events. It peaked between November 2023 and January 2024. The WMO had also warned on Tuesday, March 5, that while El Niño is gradually weakening, “it will continue to impact the global climate in the coming months, fueling the heat trapped by greenhouse gases from human activities.” Even as the Philippines and other countries are still dealing with the effects of El Niño, PAGASA explained that the issuance of La Niña Watch is already needed since there is now a 55% chance of La Niña developing in the next six months. La Niña“is characterized by unusually cooler than average sea surface temperatures in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific.” It triggers above-normal rainfall in the Philippines. But Ana Liza Solis, officer-in-charge of PAGASA’s Climatology and Agrometeorology Division, noted that the raising of La Niña Watch is not an absolute guarantee that the phenomenon will indeed develop. “It’s still uncertain. Once PAGASA raises La Niña Alert, that’s when confidence would be higher that La Niña will develop. The La Niña Watch [issued now] is asking you to be aware and be prepared,” Solis said in a mix of Filipino and English. The last La Niña was a “triple-dip” event, according to the WMO, as it began in September 2020 and lasted until early 2023, or for three straight years. Aside from the gradually weakening El Niño and the possibility of La Niña, the onset of the country’s warm and dry season is also expected to be announced soon. PAGASA said in Thursday’s briefing that it expects to declare the start of the warm and dry season – which Filipinos often call “summer” – within two weeks. So far, the northeast monsoon or amihan has yet to be terminated. PAGASA reminded the public that soaring temperatures from March to May may pose health risks such as heat stroke and heat exhaustion. The onset of the rainy season after the warm and dry season could also be slightly delayed, partly due to the ongoing El Niño. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Office of the Ombudsman lifted the suspension order against 72 warehouse supervisors of the National Food Authority (NFA) across the country in an order dated May 10, Friday. Last March, the Ombudsman preventively suspended 139 NFA officials and employees for selling milled rice stock to select traders without public bidding and approval from the NFA council. The anti-graft watchdog ruled that the suspension of warehouse supervisors is “no longer necessary.” “[T]here is insufficient ground to believe that their continued stay in office may prejudice the investigation of the case filed against them,” the order read. Suspended officials included administrator Roderico Bioco, assistant administrator for operations John Robert Hermano, 12 regional managers, 27 branch managers, and 98 warehouse supervisors. Department of Agriculture (DA) Secretary Francisco Tiu Laurel Jr. said in a statement on Tuesday, that the Ombudsman’s decision will allow NFA to reopen padlocked warehouses needed as supplies of palay supplies are expected to come in. “I instructed the NFA to immediately implement the Ombudsman’s order,” he said. According to Tiu Laurel, the DA’s own investigation will be shared with the anti-graft body once it’s completed soon. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – A Commission on Audit (COA) team has sought sanctions against officials of the Department of Information and Communications Technology (DICT) who failed to meet deadlines on submission of the agency’s Financial Statements (FS) in the past three years. State auditors said in a letter posted on November 6, Monday, that the DICT has not heeded annual reminders on meeting the timetable on submitting yearend and quarterly FS, as well as supporting account schedules and subsidiary ledgers. The deadline for yearend FS is February 14 the following year while quarterly FS are supposed to be turned over to the audit team within 10 days from the end of each quarter. These documents are needed to facilitate referencing and monitoring and identifying accountabilities. Auditors said that among the unsubmitted financial reports that should have been part of the FS were the aging of accounts, schedule of income taxes paid, schedule of fund transfer, statement of management responsibility, statement of comparison of budget and actual amounts. The DICT said it was able to submit the 2022 yearend FS on May 2, 2023 but without the Statement of Management Responsibility. Electronic copies of the complete yearend FS for 2021 was submitted to the COA only on June 28, 2022 while the complete hardcopy was handed to the audit team only on May 2, 2023. “The delayed submission of the financial reports and records has been a yearly observation of the AT (audit team). In CYs [Calendar Years] 2020 and 2021, the DICT failed to submit its FS within the prescribed period that necessarily should be supported with complete schedules and SLs (subsidiary ledgers),” the audit team said. “Failure of officials/employees concerned to comply shall cause the automatic suspension of the payment of their salaries and other emoluments until they have complied. Violation of at least three consecutive times shall subject the offender to administrative disciplinary action,” it added. Auditors recommended that the DICT Legal Services review the records and recommend to the DICT secretary the appropriate action based on Presidential Decree No. 1445 or the Government Auditing Code of the Philippines, specifically the “suspension of salaries of those officials/employees responsible.” In its comment on the findings, the DICT said it concurs with the audit recommendations. It also told the COA that it has tapped additional manpower for its accounting department to avoid delayed submission of financial reports. The DICT is the “primary policy, planning, coordinating, implementing, and administrative entity of the Executive Branch of the government that will plan, develop, and promote the national ICT development agenda.” Among its functions is cybersecurity which includes suppressing cybercrime offenses and cyberattacks on critical infrastructures that affect national security. It is also supposed to provide “pro-active government countermeasures against domestic and transnational incidents affecting the Philippine cyberspace” as well as cybersecurity threats to the country. – Rappler.com",

MANILA, Philippines – The Philippine embassy in Israel has recommended that all travel from the Philippines to Israel be postponed indefinitely after Israel declared a “state of war” in response to the attacks by the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. Philippine Airlines (PAL) and Cebu Pacific offer flights to Dubai, after which travelers take other airlines to Tel Aviv. “We wish to clarify that Philippine Airlines does not operate flights to Tel Aviv. We do not use Israeli airspace for any of our flights,” said PAL spokesperson Cielo Villaluna. “In view of the volatile security situation in Israel, the Philippine Embassy in Tel Aviv strongly recommends that all travel from the Philippines to Israel be postponed indefinitely, or until such time that the situation has stabilized,” the embassy said in a post on its Facebook account late Sunday, October 15. Travel from the busy Ben Gurion International Airport, also known as Tel Aviv airport, to Manila, however, remains open which means Filipinos in Israel can still leave the country and fly home, the embassy said. “Those with confirmed flights, however, are advised to check with their travel agency for possible flight cancellations,” it added. Hamas has also reportedly targeted the Ben Gurion International Airport, according to CNN, following the group’s surprise attack from Gaza on October 7. People in Tel Aviv have been advised to stay indoors while people in Gaza, southern Israel, where the conflict is raging, have been advised to stay in underground shelters. Thousands of Filipinos fly to Israel, where the Holy Land is located, for travel and leisure purposes. The Israel Ministry of Tourism said in July 2023 that a total of 19,300 Filipino tourists visited their country from January to June 2023. In 2019, prior to the pandemic, Israel hosted 34,000 Filipino tourists. Based on data relased by the Department of Migrant Workers in August 2022, around 23,754 overseas Filipino workers (OFWs) in Israel are employed mostly as caregivers, service sector employees, and hotel workers. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Sunday ordered all government agencies to ensure the safety of OFWs in Israel in response to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Support for amending the 1987 Constitution has dropped significantly over the past year, according to a Pulse Asia Research, Incorporated survey released on Wednesday, March 27. From 41% of Filipino adults supporting charter change efforts in March 2023, there are now only 8% in favor of the move. The pollster, which interviewed 1,200 respondents from March 6 to 10, said 88% of Filipinos are not in favor of amending the Constitution, a 43-percentage point increase from the 45% who opposed the move last year. A big majority or 74% of Filipinos said it “should not be amended now or any other time,” a significant increase from 31% in March 2023. Of the 88% opposed to amending the Constitution, 6% are open to charter change under the Marcos administration, while 8% said they would prefer changes to be made under the next administration. “Sa pamamagitan ng survey na ito ay ipinapakita na halos 90% ng mga Filipino ay ayaw at laban sa charter change,” ACT Teachers Representative France Castro said in a statement. (This survey shows that almost 90% of Filipinos are against charter change.) “Kaya dapat itigil na ang charter change at ituon ng gobyerno ang oras at resources nito sa pressing problems ng mga Filipino.” (That’s why we need to stop charter change now at have the government dedicate its time and resources to the Filipino people’s pressing problems instead.) The survey results were released just a week after Resolution of Both Houses No. 7 (RBH7) was passed by the House of Representatives after weeks of holding marathon hearings. The survey results showed that 67% of the respondents are aware of the current efforts to amend the charter through the people’s initiative, but 93% were not among those who received the public petition. Only 7% were reached by the public initiative, and “most did not affix their signature to the document.” Among the 24% who signed the people’s initiative, respondents were almost split when asked if they received an incentive for signing the petition. Pulse Asia said 45% said they received an incentive for signing the petition, mostly from Class E. One of the allegations surrounding the public initiative is that people were tricked into signing the petition, which was guised as financial assistance from government agencies. Most of the respondents said they were not in favor of the proposed reforms. There were also changes in support for some of the proposed charter amendments compared to the previous year For example, there are now less Filipinos supporting the move to allow foreign individuals and firms to own stakes in mass media and advertising and on calls for term extension for both national and local officials. Support for changing the country’s government system also saw a 20-percentage point drop in support. In March 2023, 38% of Filipinos said they favored the move but the numbers dropped to 18% in 2024. RBH7, the proposal that breezed through the House last week, inserts the phrase “unless otherwise provided by law” in provisions limiting foreign ownership in the public utilities, education, and advertising sectors. It is a resolution copied from the proposals of the Senate, which House lawmakers adopted to expedite the charter change process at the 19th Congress. The ball is now at the Senate, which has had four public hearings on the charter amendments so far. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – Amid excessive heat caused by the El Niño phenomenon, the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) called on employers to implement flexible working arrangements when possible. “Ang DOLE po ay advocate ng, una, flexible work arrangement, tapos ‘yung tinatawag na work-from-home arrangement (The DOLE is an advocate of flexible work and work-from-home arrangements),” Labor Secretary Bienvenido Laguesma said in a press briefing on Friday, April 26. Laguesma was responding to Camarines Sur 2nd District Representative LRay Villafuerte, who had called for the return to the work-from-home setup to protect both public and private sector employees from the heat. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), tagged dangerous temperatures in some areas in the country, reaching as high as over 40 degrees celsius, which may result in heat stroke. In elaborating on the DOLE’s position, Laguesma said that flexible working arrangements help with three things: work-life balance, “enhancement” of an employee’s satisfaction, and productivity. But the labor secretary recognized that not all jobs could be easily done in a flexible or work-from-home arrangement. “Siguro doon sa mga may pangangailangan sa physical presence, higit naming pag-iibayuhin ‘yung assistance ng DOLE – paano ba magkaroon ng working hours, working conditions…. Sana epektibo at saka efficient ang ventilation, insulation, at saka ‘yung personal protective equipment,” he said. (For jobs that require physical presence, the DOLE will enhance its assistance – how to have working hours, [ensure] working conditions…. They should be effective and efficient ventilation and insulation, and also personal protective equipment.) The DOLE issued Labor Advisory No. 8 in 2023, which provides for safety and health measures to prevent and control heat stress in workplaces. These include recommendations to adjust working hours, implement breaks for heat-related rest and recovery, and provide free potable water. Labor Undersecretary Benjo Santos Benavidez said that some workers have “lost their jobs” due to the effects of El Niño. (READ: Extreme heat is hurting the economy) He said that as of April, the DOLE assisted more than 35,000 workers through its emergency employment program, Tulong Panghanapbuhay sa Ating Disadvantaged/Displaced Workers (TUPAD) in the Cordillera Administrative Region, Ilocos Region, Central Luzon, Calabarzon, Mimaropa, Western Visayas, Zamboanga Peninsula, and Northern Mindanao. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "UTRECHT, The Netherlands – The National Democratic Front of the Philippines (NDFP) said on Tuesday, June 6, it was still open to the possibility of resuming peace negotiations under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., but on certain conditions. “If we see signs that the President is interested in peace negotiations, the NDF has always said that it is open to peace negotiations, but of course there will have to be some steps before the NDF enters into peace negotiations,” said NDFP negotiating panel interim chair Juliet de Lima, wife of the late Jose Maria Sison, the founding chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). The NDFP is the political wing of the CPP. De Lima said among the conditions would be for the Philippine government to take back the designation of their peace consultants as terrorists under the contested anti-terror law, and the release of political prisoners. “So far I have not read anything from the President of any interest in resuming the peace negotiations, so right now there’s really nothing,” De Lima told Rappler in an interview at the NDF office in Utrecht on Tuesday. The Marcos government has given no sign of interest in resuming peace talks. In March, army chief Lieutenant General Romeo Brawner Jr. said, “Our President has ordered an end to the CPP-NPA – finish them off.” Marcos’ new defense secretary, Gilbert “Gibo” Teodoro Jr. told the ABS-CBN News Channel Wednesday, June 7, in Manila that he had “always been against” entering into peace talks. “Well, Marcos is a Marcos, and he’s probably like his father who would depend on the military, who would be still puppet to the US,” said De Lima. Teodoro was the defense secretary under former president Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo, who launched an intense counter-insurgency campaign against the Left. One of Arroyo’s top military commanders, Jovito Palparan Jr., is serving sentence at the New Bilibid Prison over the disappearance of student activists Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeno. Luis Jalandoni, NDFP’s senior adviser who is also exiled in the Netherlands, has been designated as a terrorist under the new law passed by former president Rodrigo Duterte during the pandemic. The law has been mostly upheld by the Philippine Supreme Court, with a narrow window of opportunity for future legal challenges when actual cases arise. Jalandoni said that, for his part, there are no legal steps yet to challenge his designation, or the constitutionality of the law’s clause that allows the executive anti-terror council to designate anybody as a terrorist without having to present proof before a court. “There are attempts and campaigns by organizations here in The Netherlands, but also in the USA, Canada, and other countries. They have taken up the campaign, and their main argument is that it goes against the possibilities of resuming the peace talks,” said Jalandoni. Duterte ended peace talks with the communists in 2019 after a promising start when he became president in 2016. Since then, Duterte created the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict (NTF-ELCAC), which launched intense campaigns that included red-tagging of activists and journalists. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Office of the Ombudsman has affirmed its resolution that recommended the filing of graft charges against officials involved in the Pharmally Pharmaceutical Corporation mess. In an order dated May 3, but was publicized on Thursday, May 9, the Ombudsman denied the supplemental motion for reconsideration filed by former Procurement Service-Department of Budget and Management (PS-DBM) undersecretary Lloyd Christopher Lao. Aside from dismissing the appeal, the Ombudsman also modified its indictment order and included Lin Weixiong. Lin Weixiong is Rose Nono Lin’s husband. He was among the business personalities implicated in the Pharmally mess. The private respondents include Twinkle Dargani, Mohit Dargani, Linconn Ong, Justine Garado, and Huang Tzu Yen. The Ombudsman’s special panel of investigators recommended the filing of charges against Lao, former procurement director and current Overall Deputy Ombudsman Warren Rex Liong, and other PS-DBM and Pharmally officials under the Anti-Graft and Corrupt Practices Act. The Ombudsman said the respondents allegedly conspired and acted in bad faith in procuring RT-PCR test kits worth P1.3 billion. Pharmally was among the biggest scandals that happened during the presidency of former president Rodrigo Duterte. A string of anomalies was exposed in connection with the multi-billion-peso COVID-19 contracts awarded by Duterte’s government to Pharmally, a small company with a mere P625,000-capital. An investigative report by Rappler revealed that Chinese businessman Michael Yang, Duterte’s former economic adviser and friend, has links to Pharmally. The company’s officials said Yang was their financier and guarantor, but the former presidential adviser denied the claim. – Rappler.com",

Marcos was referring to his predecessor’s bloody and ruthless “war on drugs” that mostly targeted the poor. For Marcos, the government’s focus should veer less towards law enforcement and focus more on prevention and helping heal those who are already addicted to illegal subtances. “We are trying to learn which are the best methods now to pull our victims – [because] really is what they are – pull them out of that culture and to help them start again and do live a good life as good and contributing members of society,” added Marcos. Months earlier, in July, Interior Secretary Benhur Abalos had also said that there would be no letup in the war against drugs. “The war against drugs will be as intensive as before on the basis of my oath as a public official in accordance with the Constitution,” Abalos said then. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Commission on Elections (Comelec) sought a P43.7-billion budget for 2024, the year when preparation for the 2025 midterm elections is heaviest, but the executive department trimmed over one-third of its requested funding in its submission to Congress. The National Expenditure Program (NEP) for 2024 released on Wednesday, August 2, indicates that the Department of Budget and Management (DBM) is only asking Congress a P27.1-billion budget for the poll body for 2024. In terms of preparations for the midterm polls, the Comelec specifically requested P28.3 billion, but the executive branch only proposed P22.9 billion to the House. The Comelec, in May, made public its proposed blueprint for the 2025 automated elections, which it called FASTrAC, or Fully Automated System with Transparency, Audit, and Count. Under the proposal, the commission seeks to retire 97,000 vote-counting machines (VCMs) that the Philippines has relied on since 2016, since they are already prone to glitches despite refurbishment. What the Comelec seeks to replace them with are automated counting machines (ACMs), which are still optical mark readers (OMRs), wherein voters use a paper ballot counted by machines. But the poll body also wants these machines to have direct recording electronic (DRE) capabilities, where voters use a touch screen or touch pad. This option would greatly benefit Persons With Disabilities and illiterate voters. The Comelec believes the technology is already available, and has been looking for interested suppliers. However, this ambitious reform would not be possible without big funding from Congress. Reacting to DBM’s proposal to Congress, Comelec Chairman George Garcia said the poll body would have to be more prudent. “We would have to [reduce] support staff in every precinct or increase the allocation of voters per precinct, so that we would rent fewer machines,” he said on Thursday, August 3. Comelec spokesman Rex Laudiangco also hopes that whatever lack in funding for 2024 will be made up for in the 2025 budget. “The procurement of the automated election system (AES) part of the NLE may proceed in 2024, short of award, depending on the availability of fund allotment. At any rate, while most of the components thereof are bundled, the same is clustered, and we could proceed to procure such on a lot basis, with the completion of payments being in time for the 2025 budgeting and release,” he said. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – The Department of Health (DOH) said on Thursday, September 29, that the country needs 106,000 nurses both in public and private facilities and hospitals. “We have a shortage or a gap of around 106,000 para mapunuan natin ‘yung mga facilities natin (so we could fill in the facilities) all over the country, both public and private,” DOH officer-in-charge Maria Rosario Vergeire said in a press briefing. The health official urged Filipino health workers to apply for the positions and coordinate with the DOH’s Human Resources Bureau to process their documents. “Nananawagan po tayo sa ating mga kababayan na our nurses here in the country, midwives in the country, our dentists, and other healthcare professionals, meron tayong vacant na plantilla positions para ma-hire namin kayo,” Vergeire said. (We’re calling on our nurses here in the country, midwives, dentists, and other healthcare professionals, we have vacant plantilla positions, we can hire you.) Vergeire said that one of the reasons why the country lacks health workers is migration. She said the DOH wanted to maintain the 7,500 yearly deployment cap. “Isa po ito sa mga dahilan kung bakit nagkukulang ang mga healthcare workers dito sa ating bansa, specifically doon sa ating mga facilities (This is one of the reasons why we lack healthcare workers here in the country, specifically in government facilities). This is because of the migration of our healthcare workers,” she said. At the height of the pandemic in 2021, various hospitals had been hit by resignations, aggravating a shortage of manpower and exposing once more the plight of health workers in the Philippines. Filipino nurses continue to seek better opportunities abroad in pursuit of higher pay and better working conditions. – Rappler.com",

      "article_body": "MANILA, Philippines – President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Wednesday, April 24, that he has nixed a Metro Manila Council (MMC) directive that sought to raise the fines for illegal parking in the National Capital Region. According to the Presidential Communications Office, MMC’s Joint Traffic Circular No. 01 would have increased the financial penalty for violators from P1,000 to P4,000 beginning April 15. “While I understand the intention behind the proposal, I’ve decided to prioritize discipline over penalties,” Marcos said in a video statement. “Ang Bagong Pilipino ay disiplinado (The New Filipino is disciplined.)” “By focusing on individual responsibility, we can create long-lasting solutions to our traffic challenge,” he added. The logic is reminiscent of Marcos’ earlier directive not to penalize yet e-bicycles and e-tricycles plying national roads in Metro Manila once the ban on such vehicles took effect on April 15. Marcos had said more time is needed to educate the public about the ban. On April 10, Marcos led a town hall on the capital region’s traffic woes, an apparent effort to show the government’s commitment in addressing a perennial problem in Metro Manila. During the summit, the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority unveiled adjusted working hours for all local government unit employees in Metro Manila. San Juan Mayor Francis Zamora later said this policy will take effect on May 2. – Rappler.com",
