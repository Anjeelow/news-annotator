TYPE OF BIAS: Flawed Logic
---
For Government: "As the Department of National Defense enforces the Anti-Terrorism bill, radical leftist protesters joined by rebel organizations such as Anakbayan and Makabayan have exhibited rebellious behavior, which calls into question if they really are fighting for the Philippines like fellow peaceful citizens. Makabayan is also a supporter of militant action, which makes enforcement necessary to make the Philippines safe. It should be noted that Anakbayan's only Senator supported the bill."
(Contains: Hasty generalization, appeal to groupthink, implication of guilt by association)

Neutral: "The Department of National Defense begins enforcing the Anti-Terrorism bill to mixed reactions. Government groups claim that it will help bolster national security, while organizations like Anakbayan claim that the bill will stifle free speech for the citizens."

Against Government: "The Anti-Terrorism Bill enforced by the Department of National Defense has made it clear, the government is not on your side. The current administration is willing to silence student voices through prosecution, oppress free speech, and take away the rights of responsible citizens over their right to assembly. This may be the start of more fascistic policies that the citizens should continue to resist."
(Contains: Slippery slope, black-and-white thinking)

==============================================================================
V. WHAT SHOULD NOT BE ANNOTATED
==============================================================================

1. Do NOT annotate bias if charged words are factually accurate.
   Example: "The Government has killed people" is NOT biased if the article discusses an actual military operation.

2. Do NOT annotate simply based on the presence of charged words.
   Example: "communist" alone is not biased, but "communist rebels" is charged.

3. Do NOT annotate based purely on claim veracity.
   Example: "The Philippine Government has been seen planting trees in Vietnam" is not necessarily biased just because it's disputed.

4. Do NOT annotate bias towards governments OTHER than the Philippine Government.
   Example: "The Chinese Government continues to showcase years of collaborative effort with the Philippines" - this is biased towards China, NOT the Philippine Government.
